# A-ZARS - ZARS for Analysis
A-Zars is a software completely written in Python for the analysis of reviews extracted from Online Travel Agencies (OTAs) through the [ZARS](https://github.com/alessiamns/ZARS) software. 

A-ZARS allows you to search for a service within the review using Machine Learning algorithms, perform sentiment analysis of the reviews and add the Geonames code to the locations of origin of the authors of the reviews. A-Zars is released under the GNU General Public License v 3.0.
