      "INDEX 0  REVIEW   When we arrived from Palermo airport shortly before midnight on Friday evening without luggage, the concierge served us a glass of wine as a nightcap. We were two couples and spent a long weekend at the Prinicip di Villafranca. The staff was extremely friendly. The rooms are functional and nicely and practically furnished. Comfortable beds, good bathroom and clean parquet floors. As usual in Palermo, in the morning it is loud from the streets of the city. The crew recommended and made reservations for very good restaurants, and the hotel also organized a guided tour for us. The hotel is highly recommended, we will stay there again.\n",
      "INDEX 1  REVIEW   The house or the entrance itself is a bit set back from the main street and my room was at the back and was therefore very quiet. The room corresponds to the pictures shown and is very lovingly furnished. Particularly noteworthy are the shutters on the windows and the balcony, as well as the elevator, so that the annoying lugging of suitcases is no longer necessary. The hostess was helpful with parking (tip: Better to go to the parking lot at Viale Annunziata, free on Sundays and otherwise only from 3:30 p.m. to around 8:00 p.m.). As a welcome there was a plate of watermelon, which I really enjoyed after the hard and warm day. The hostess gave me great tips and also explained how to get to the city center by tram. There was even a free ticket (there and back) for the tram, for which I thank you again. For breakfast there was, among other things, the regional specialty brioche with granita and an explanation of how this is \"properly\" eaten. Not my case though, so I switched to the other dishes. The host Elena is very welcoming and I had very good conversations with her in English. She was not only interested in where from and where in Sicily, but also in my person. I also learned a lot about the hostess, which I found very interesting. I can definitely recommend this B&B! Great value for money, even if a free cancellation was not possible (at least when I booked).\n",
      "INDEX 2  REVIEW   On our round trip we also stayed in Enna for one night and slept there. (Family, 2 children) The apartment on the ground floor was very nicely and stylishly furnished. All clean. Breakfast was also varied and delicious. The hosts are very, very nice. With pleasure again.\n",
      "INDEX 3  REVIEW   The hotel looks more like Milan from the outside, but is very modern and well-kept inside. Rooms are quite large and clean, the bathroom is small but ok. The walls are unfortunately a bit noisy and the breakfast is not too big (Italy), but otherwise we slept very well here. Close to the center of Palermo (10 minutes on foot) and super close to many great shops. Very helpful and courteous staff. We were even allowed to put our motorcycle in front of the garage. Internally it works a little slowly but you don't have time for it anyway. Gladly again.\n",
      "INDEX 4  REVIEW   Within walking distance of the famous baroque churches and palazzi as well as the imposing theaters, but away from the tourist hype and the sad horse-drawn carriages. Via Principe di Villafranca is located in the wonderful Novecento district. The small hotel has well-kept furnishings, which fortunately have a very personal style. No pomp, small but nice. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful.\n",
      "INDEX 5  REVIEW   A top B&B like you would otherwise have to look for. On the top floor completely undisturbed with a magnificent view. Round bed, many designer details, everything very tastefully decorated. Breakfast is also perfect. In addition, very nice owner who waited at the turnoff to the feeder road and guided us through the narrowest street. Adventurous when there is still one centimeter of space on each side of a Peugeot 208 with the side mirrors folded up ...\n",
      "INDEX 6  REVIEW   My girlfriend and I stayed at the Ibis style Palermo Centro in Palermo in December 2019. We were extremely satisfied. The hotel itself is centrally located - everything is within walking distance, pedestrian zone in the immediate vicinity, plane bus just around the corner. The house is clean and well-kept, the rooms are large, clean and comfortable. The breakfast is very good for Italian standards! There are eggs, ham, cheese, sweets, yoghurts, fruit etc. The staff at the reception is incredibly friendly and helpful. When booking, I hadn't pointed out that I wanted two beds in a double room and was given a double room with one bed when I checked in, but the next morning we were able to move straight to a double room with two beds. Thanks again for that. We can definitely recommend the hotel. The price performance ratio is very good. Everything fits. Thanks again!\n",
      "INDEX 7  REVIEW   Probably the best B&B in Enna. Very clean and stylish premises. Breakfast is very good too. The landlords are very friendly and familiar. We can highly recommend it. We will definitely stay there again next time we visit.\n",
      "INDEX 8  REVIEW   If we had known what to expect, we would have stayed three nights! Pamela and Guiseppe are born hosts, with great attention to detail and their own design style! The breakfast buffet was the burner and the many tips are enough for three days of visiting archeology, culture, history, gastronomy and other sights in the center of Sicily: grinning:\n",
      "INDEX 9  REVIEW   A lot of price, no performance. Even the reception was extremely unfriendly, you were not accompanied to the room and there was no additional information. The suites were very different: One very large and beautiful, the other rather small, did not correspond to any suite. The breakfast buffet was underground. The coffee is undrinkable, the orange juice is artificial and everything else is dry and absolutely not fresh. The service unkempt and unfriendly. The lunch (about 5 people in a huge hall) was inedible. When we checked out, the bill was handed to us without comment (we speak fluent Italian - silence is international ...) and there was no goodbye or a friendly word. A very expensive but disappointing stay!\n",
      "INDEX 10  REVIEW   Looking out from our window you could swear you were in the sea ....we were that close. Very quiet and large rooms with Windows that open. You could lie on the bed and look out to sea. Great central location with lots of bars and restaurants within easy walking distance.  The bar on the top floor was great and we would have enjoyed sitting outside if it wasn't so unseasonably wet while we were there. This was also the breakfast room and they made a very good coffee. The staff were so friendly especially the lovely Giussi ! Can highly recommend this hotel as a great place to stay in Trapani.\n",
      "INDEX 11  REVIEW   We had a very comfortable stay at Delle Vittorie. Rooms were clean and comfortable, the innkeepers were kind and helpful, and the breakfast buffet was fresh and plentiful. Good strong coffee is made to order. Location is central to almost all sights in Palermo.\n",
      "INDEX 12  REVIEW   We spent one night at this fine boutique hotel in Trapani and quite frankly the pictures on the internet don’t do it justice. The staff is very attentive and personable, wanting to make sure your stay is worry free and enjoyable.The bar and breakfast room is on the roof top with wonderful views, sofas and ample shade for those wishing to stay out of the sun. Our room overlooked the piazza. Parking was street parking by meter as described but this was no problem and in fact we could see our rental car from our room. When we checked in we were told that the rate for our room had dropped and gave us 2 complimentary breakfasts. The location is proximate to many restaurants and shops. Complimentary bottled water is provided as well.\n",
      "INDEX 13  REVIEW   the twins were amazing from start to finish. Helpful when we arrived with parking, restaurant suggestions and information about the surrounding area. The apartment style hotel room was clean, updated and really cool, right in the middle of it all. I would stay again.\n",
      "INDEX 14  REVIEW   Nice hotel, great location and view FromThe room. I don’t give them 5 stars because they don’t have parking. You can park on the street nearby . The view from The breakfast bar is also great. It is ay walking distance from all The important spots of the City\n",
      "INDEX 15  REVIEW   This B&B is luxuriously appointed and has a great location just around the corner from one of the main pedestrian streets in Palermo. Just steps from major sites, restaurants and shops, it is the perfect location for visitors. The owner is very friendly and helpful. Transportation from the airport can also be arranged. The selection of pastries for breakfast was excellent.\n",
      "INDEX 16  REVIEW   Behind a big wooden door- you enter a dark entry with an elevator from the year of the flood.. what you might expect from a Times Square hotel that charges by the hour.  But have faith- one floor up - there is another door to the B&B- and you enter another world. Modern- clean- comfortable room- excellent bath- and quiet considering you are in the center of Palermo . ( yards from the main walking street ) Nice buffet breakfast too. Only negative- hundreds of channels in Italian and not one in English- but who has time for TV. Ask Frederica anything before arrival or after- and it is done. Recommended\n",
      "INDEX 17  REVIEW   The staff were so welcoming it made the stay a nicer experience. The location is perfect right in the historic area. The road outside the hotel was to be closed the next morning due to a run which was taking place so we had to park the car in a nearby car park. This was no hassle at all and took about 5 mins to walk back to the hotel. Breakfast was just ok nothing special but as we got a good deal this wasn’t a problem. If asked would we recommend this hotel, the answer is yes, and would gladly stay there again if we were in the area.\n",
      "INDEX 18  REVIEW   Selected this place based on reviews and it did not disappoint. Martina welcomed us and gave us the lay of the land; very centrally located, easy walk to all important sites. Clean, comfortable, and homey - including a wonderful breakfast. Definitely recommended.\n",
      "INDEX 19  REVIEW   We loved this hotel! We found parking very easily by the hotel (free on the weekends and pay during the weekdays). The rooms are incredibly spacious with a large modern bathroom. The breakfast spread was delicious and the staff was so helpful with anything we asked them. I would highly recommend La Gancia.\n",
      "INDEX 20  REVIEW   It does not reach the pension category. Scarce breakfast and very old facilities ... No WI-FI service !!! I was staying for three weeks and during all that time they kept me longing about the constant repairs that my room required. I feel like I was teased. WE WILL NOT RETURN.\n",
      "INDEX 21  REVIEW   We were 3 people, and they gave us on the top floor as an apartment that was very well divided since it had a living room with a kitchen, 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms. The rooms are old-fashioned but fine, but the bathrooms should be updated to make them look better. It is in a very good location, in the center of the city.\n",
      "INDEX 22  REVIEW   Do not hesitate, it is really very good and it is located in the best place in Palermo. On the border between the historic and elegant areas of the city, a few minutes' walk from the main tourist spots. The Palazzo is elegant and very tasteful. Highly recommended!\n",
      "INDEX 23  REVIEW   The hotel is located in a well communicated area with services. Also, the rooms are large and comfortable. In our case, we were assigned a small apartment with a dining room and built-in kitchen, apart from the (gigantic) bedroom and bathroom. Regarding the bathroom, it was small and old, .... but despite its bad appearance, it was clean. As for breakfast, it is quite scarce and they only offer sweets: biscuits, cakes, some fruit, juices and coffee from the machine. Calling attention to the reception hours: from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m., so if you arrive later, you will find yourself in a little problem since you will have to contact by calling a mobile phone and crossing your fingers waiting for a answer, .... In our case, after waiting almost a quarter of an hour, it coincided that a couple of Italians arrived who were the ones who managed to locate the receptionist by phone, ask her to open up and explain how to proceed, since there was no no one at the reception, ....\n",
      "INDEX 24  REVIEW   A group of 10 people traveled to Palermo to celebrate a birthday, from the first moment Federico has been exceptionally helpful in organizing lunches and dinners, excursions, activities and above all making us feel as if we were at home. Federico and the Palazzo Sovrana team have made our stay easy and have made this vacation very special and unforgettable.\n",
      "INDEX 25  REVIEW   We had a huge disappointment with this hotel. A room where the two of us could barely fit, beds so narrow that the arms dangled at the sides, and to top it off a bad breakfast. We will never go back.\n",
      "INDEX 26  REVIEW   Well located hotel in a quiet area, not far from the city center. Comfortable and spacious room. Limited garage in terms of space. Correct breakfast, although the part of hot products is little varied and sometimes with absences.\n",
      "INDEX 27  REVIEW   Excellent b & b. It is located in an old building, but when you open the elevator door, you find a spectacular place. Both Larisa and Corina are in every detail, always attentive and ready to help in everything. First class rooms as well as breakfast. If you go to messina, do not stop going !!!!\n",
      "INDEX 28  REVIEW   Located in Messina, a neighborhood away from the center and located between blocks of buildings, ideal to spend a night when you go en route around the island or to catch a ferry to Calabria. Exceptional treatment very very attentive, excellent room, new and modern, with water in the fridge and modern toilet and more than correct, everything very clean and very good typical breakfast, correct price. Nearby area with restaurants, pizzerias etc ...\n",
      "INDEX 29  REVIEW   It is located in a quiet street, with parking. It is a very nice place, Carmelo, its owner, is a very polite and very kind person. The cleaning is 10 and the treatment is fantastic. Beautiful room, and comfortable. Without a doubt if you go to messina, you can rest in that place. I will return, without a doubt.\n",
      "INDEX 30  REVIEW   good idea to build an old palace in the center and add a divine restaurant. Impeccable exercise and quality service. No car necessary. Comfortable rooms and good air conditioning.\n",
      "INDEX 31  REVIEW   We spent 3 nights with the family at this superb hotel. We had a wonderful family room with a very quiet terrace. The bedding is top notch and the sanitary facilities are very modern. The hotel's hyper-central location in the old town is ideal for exploring the city on foot and easily returning to rest. The hotel has a wooded patio-type courtyard which is a haven of peace. The breakfasts are very good with very efficient teams and service. The big plus is the valet parking which makes your life so much easier if you have a car as it is almost impossible to park nearby. I totally recommend and regret not having had the time to try the hotel restaurant. Surely next time.\n",
      "INDEX 32  REVIEW   B & B with Reception service. Very correct rooms, perhaps the triple room to be avoided, a little small and small beds, very good for children or teenagers ... Savory breakfast prepared to order, sweet on the buffet. But the big plus of this “hotel” is its location in the heart of the lively, historic and commercial district of Messina.\n",
      "INDEX 33  REVIEW   Really a very good address: welcome, kindness, friendliness cleanliness, really perfect. Excellent breakfast. Very pleasant staff. To recommend in the city. : parking service by the hotel, very efficient. A pleasure to stay there.\n",
      "INDEX 34  REVIEW   Ideally located in Palermo, the Quintocanto has one flaw, it is very loud. We can hear everything that is happening and said to each other in the next room .... I had to bang on the partition .... late at night ... So, it's up to you .....\n",
      "INDEX 35  REVIEW   An establishment which deserves a maximum score at all levels. Professionalism, courtesy, location, service, everything is at the top. In the heart of the old town, a valet will take care of your luggage and your car. A beautiful interior courtyard connects the hotel to the restaurant which serves excellent Sicilian cuisine. In addition, one of the very few hotels in Italy where you can benefit from heating after April 15th. To discover and taste without moderation.\n",
      "INDEX 36  REVIEW   The view from this place is magnificent ideal place to rest in peace the owners and the young girl who prepares the breakfasts for you are adorable little flat for the bedding the mattress is not firm enough and the dinner of the first evening my a little disappointed but overall we had a pleasant stay thank you the bruno couple\n",
      "INDEX 37  REVIEW   It is not easy to access (the road is not of very good quality: we wondered if we were not going in the wrong direction!) But the place is really worth the detour. We arrive there and we are immediately relaxed ... A real haven of peace. The panorama is very pleasant, the rooms are large and adequate, with everything you need. In the evening we ate what Silvia had concocted and it was simply delicious! The portions were generous, in short we had a great time, around discussions about the food and a bit of everything. The breakfast was very good too. The place seemed ideal for families. And how cute were the kittens!\n",
      "INDEX 38  REVIEW   A haven of peace and a dream landscape ... and an unequaled welcome from Silvia and Bruno who literally pampered us. we had an excellent stay in this property where peace reigns in an idyllic setting. Nice to meet you, we will definitely come back and warmly recommend this unmissable address.\n",
      "INDEX 39  REVIEW   Very well located near many tourist locations. Friendly and professional welcome and staff. Room with sober decoration, spacious and very clean. Same as bathroom. Excellent bedding. Superb breakfast taken on the roof top with an extraordinary view of Palermo, which alone justifies the choice of the hotel. You can also dine there with always this magnificent view, night version, excellent restaurant. Small flat, despite the elevator that serves the floors, access to the restaurant is on the top floor by a flight of stairs, which can be complicated for people with reduced mobility. Our room facing the avenue, the exterior insulation was ok, however the stairwell is noisy.\n",
      "INDEX 40  REVIEW   This is an excellent B&B! Everything was spotless and our room was very comfortable and bright. The hosts were most pleasant and provided lots of useful information about the city. The small balconies were a nice touch. I would definitely stay there again.\n",
      "INDEX 41  REVIEW   We stayed from 14 to 16 August. Very kind owner, he contacted us while we were still traveling and declared himself willing to wait for us and so it was. Spacious and clean rooms as well as private bathrooms. Excellent breakfast. Thanks to Fabio, to his father and to the exquisite Vittoria. We will definitely meet again\n",
      "INDEX 42  REVIEW   The only positive note is the welcome of the girls and the central point of the B&B, then everything negative! The room is cold with an old air conditioner that does not turn on, there is no power plug other than the plug behind the TV, which also didn't work in my room and I had to synchronize the channels several times, very uncomfortable bed with the blankets all thrown to the right and very noisy!\n",
      "INDEX 43  REVIEW   We had a room, small, cold, and with the ceiling full of cracks from water infiltrations. Not enough water heater even for a shower. Window with poor frame, without shutters, with a poorly attached curtain. Old and very noisy air conditioning. Uncomfortable spring mattresses etc ..... I do not recommend.\n",
      "INDEX 44  REVIEW   I booked this b & b in the summer for some friends who came by surprise from Matera: they were satisfied with both the rooms and the owners! Easy street parking than walking around the center! Very close to the sea\n",
      "INDEX 45  REVIEW   I was with my family from December 29 to January 2 and I was very happy. Let's now move on to the evaluation: The location is excellent (in the center), parking is a little less expensive and is often not available. However, it must be said that the receptionist immediately gave me the keys to their garage (very small, barely two cars) in case I couldn't find parking. The room was very spacious and warm, cleanliness was good. The bathroom was medium in size with the only drawback \"the water heater\". So you have to organize for showers otherwise the hot water runs out. The only annoyance is that breakfast is served in a side bar on the street and not internally despite having a small breakfast room. On the other hand, the courtesy and helpfulness of the staff is very positive. The price is normal. € 65 for a triple a day can fit.\n",
      "INDEX 46  REVIEW   I have stayed at the property several times and although a lot of time has passed between one stay and another, the constants are always the same, elegant and comfortable rooms, exceptional cleanliness and courtesy of all the staff are guaranteed. The location is exceptional and at the same time easily accessible with your own car. In short, whether it's for work or relaxation, I blindly recommend Delle Vittorie!\n",
      "INDEX 47  REVIEW   I've been there several times, with my family and alone, and I've always enjoyed it. The place is really strategic, central and easily accessible. The pleasant and well furnished rooms. The managers are kind and extremely helpful. The view ... look at the photos I added!\n",
      "INDEX 48  REVIEW   I state that I was a guest of friends, so I can not evaluate the price. We come to the strengths: The atmosphere is friendly, the staff, especially the cleaning staff, were extremely friendly and helpful. The central location is very convenient, the rooms are clean and the wi-fi worked great. As for the single room, it only had a tiny window, for some claustrophobic people it could be a problem. The points to improve can be some finishes (the shower had the plastic removed) and the breakfast, not abundant but still sufficient. A comfortable and peaceful stay all in all.\n",
      "INDEX 49  REVIEW   We were guests at this property on the night of the first Saturday in August. This B&B is in a great location, not far from the ferry dock and a short walk from the historic center and the beautiful cathedral. The staff is really very kind and available to our every request! The very comfortable and very clean rooms, the simple but excellent breakfast and as if that were not enough, served in a cute room overlooking the sea! If we happen to be in Messina again we will definitely stay here!\n",
      "INDEX 50  REVIEW   The staff (including the restaurant staff) were very good. Among them, Mr. David. For me who departed early in the morning, he arranged a breakfast and negotiated a taxi fare. I didn't mind the sound of the waves in the room directly below the sea. The hotel is not new, but the rooms were clean and the beds comfortable. When I closed the shutter and closed the glass door, I couldn't hear the outside sound and it was a quiet night. There is a famous restaurant nearby, and it is a very close hotel to the morning market, and it is a recommended hotel to stay here again!\n",
      "INDEX 51  REVIEW   Even hotels in Syracuse, which are located on the island of Ardija, are convenient for sightseeing, but the cost of lodging is high. However, the price of hotels in the town that has left the island drops at a stretch. This hotel is very convenient because it is within walking distance of both the island and ordinary shops in the city.\n",
      "The building is not new, but it is in good condition and well-equipped with an elevator so you can carry your luggage. Depending on the room, the window faces the courtyard, but it was rather quiet and nice.\n",
      "INDEX 52  REVIEW   The parking lot is the site behind the building. At the entrance, turn right at the post office next to the B&B. Since the B&B itself has to enter the ZTL road, it is quite difficult to understand and it takes courage at first, but please tell me the number at check-in, police? I will contact you.\n",
      "\n",
      "The room was clean. The amount of hot water is sufficient. Breakfast was also delicious. I didn't understand the button of the air conditioner of Fiat500 and kindly told me. The staff feels good. Parking is free, which is rare on Ordilla Island.\n",
      "INDEX 53  REVIEW   The room was super large because I chose a room where 4 people could stay even though I was 2 people. The roof was high and it was a corner room, so it was bright and nice. Is the breakfast place small? There was a public car park right next to the hotel, and when I checked in to the hotel, I received a parking permit, so it was free. After all, it is convenient that the parking lot is close to the hotel. Ortigia isn't that big, so it was okay to walk the island from this hotel.\n",
      "INDEX 54  REVIEW   In February 2020, I stayed for 3 nights as a base for a trip in eastern Sicily.\n",
      "This small B&B is a renovated interior of a historic building near the spring of Arethusa.\n",
      "The booked Quadruple-Room (No.5) was on the 2nd floor and was a large room consisting of a main room with a king bed and a second room with 2 single beds.\n",
      "The kitchen is fully equipped with a new air conditioner and refrigerator, so the facilities are perfect. Especially, the bed with crisp sheets and two pillows of memory foam and soft type was comfortable.\n",
      "Daily cleaning and towel changes are thoroughly done, and the front desk staff will support you during your stay from morning until around 2000 at night.\n",
      "Breakfast begins with tarocco (blood orange) juice, which the owner of the past squeezes himself. Even in February, Sicilian sunshine is a great breakfast served on the warm and comfortable rooftop terrace.\n",
      "I can't forget the taste of cappuccino that I was watching the sea through the rooftops of the old town.\n",
      "\n",
      "The owner, Stefano, is a kind hard worker who is full of hospitality mind. He was fluent in English and cheerful about traffic conditions in Sicily and local restaurants, and he gave us a lot of advice during his stay.\n",
      "It is thanks to him that this trip based on Syracuse has become an unforgettable one.\n",
      "I want to stay again.\n",
      "Grazie mille! Stefano.\n",
      "INDEX 55  REVIEW   Good beds, attentive bathroom, great at this price.\n",
      "The interior of the room is Spanish. As everyone wrote, breakfast is wonderful in both atmosphere and content. I went by rental car. When you park your car near the spring and go to the front, you will get in the car and guide you to the parking lot.\n",
      "It is convenient to walk to Piazza Duomo in a few minutes. Early in the morning, I walked through the empty square.\n",
      "INDEX 56  REVIEW   I moved by taxi from the Syracuse bus terminal and stayed for 3 nights. You can walk to anywhere in Ortigia, and the bright red sightseeing bus at Piazza Archimede, which is convenient for traveling around the archeological sites of Greece. The room we stayed in was large enough to face the plaza. Breakfast includes bread, ham, cheese, boiled eggs, yogurt and fruits. It was a hot season so it was a shame that there was no refrigerator in the room, but other than that, there are no particular complaints, so this is a B&B I would recommend to anyone looking for a casual inn.\n",
      "INDEX 57  REVIEW   I stayed on the first day of the tour for two nights since the date changed. First, check the area around the water and make sure that water and hot water come out. There was a paper tape on the lid of the toilet to indicate that the cleaning was finished, but inside the toilet bowl the brush was stuck in (*_*) It was a strong punch of \"Italy\" from the first day of the tour. The room of a couple who participated in the same tour seemed to be able to support the front desk at midnight due to water leakage from the ceiling, but it seems that they could hardly sleep. The room is large enough to open the trunk. I was in the room even though the Don't disturb lamp was on, and I had to dispose of the garbage and exchanged towels, but the bathtub was still cleaned with my hair stuck to it. There is a super deco 60m on the right side of the hotel, which is convenient.\n",
      "INDEX 58  REVIEW   The suitcase was wide enough. wifi also entered. Depending on the room, you may not be able to enter, so the hotel lobby is sure to enter.\n",
      "Moreover, supermarkets are very close here, a general supermarket is a store called DECO, and a slightly higher-class supermarket is a store called GUSTO, which is a souvenir chocolate (there is also a famous Modica chocolate. ), wine, etc. It was an organic supermarket.\n",
      "INDEX 59  REVIEW   The rooms are antique and cute. You can see the Temple of Apollo from the window,\n",
      "The view was good. You can use the kitchen freely, but be careful as coffee McKinetta is dirty, and there are some cafes such as Caffe Olzo whose expiration date has expired.\n",
      "It was a pity that the hot water in the bath was slimy. It has an air conditioner, but it was cold in winter because the ceiling is high. I wish I had some fruits for breakfast\n",
      "thought. Ortigia is only accessible to residents by car, so it wasn't too far to walk while rolling a suitcase, and it's good to have a convenient place to walk to the highlights of Ortigia.\n",
      "INDEX 60  REVIEW   Beautiful stay, not difficult to find, room basic but good, bathroom nice, with nice shower of which only the round doors no longer worked properly, wheels broken, unfortunately no fridge in the room, restaurant is very good, breakfast sufficient, coffee not to drink. At the end of the bill, the employee only had an eye for his phone “Facebook” and did not look at us and no thank you or goodbye. Pity.\n",
      "INDEX 61  REVIEW   A beautiful agriturismo hidden in a piece of green in busy Agrigento. The name agriturismo does not really apply here. No farmlands, not really rural. Room equipment was limited but clean. The restaurant is cozy but when the weather is nice and warmer you can probably eat outside which is great. Kitchen was good. When we were there they were clearly not ready for the season. There was nowhere to sit outside. Some rooms have outside seating and if you get the chance you have to reserve it. Fine for 1 night.\n",
      "INDEX 62  REVIEW   This agriturismo is a bit strange at a junction of highways, but that doesn't bother you. You are quickly at the famous temple valley. Excellent rooms and very good restaurant. Free parking and wifi. Staff are friendly especially the waiting staff in the restaurant. Recommended. We had a great room with a balcony.\n",
      "INDEX 63  REVIEW   A wonderful surprise behind a large door in a small street close to teatro massimo. All sights in the city are within walking distance. The owner is very nice and friendly. The B&B has spacious rooms with a beautiful bathroom. Breakfast is fairly standard with fresh pastries and fruit, could have had a little more of a Sicilian touch.\n",
      "INDEX 64  REVIEW   overnight at this Agriturismo for two nights in September. Is very remote and you have to take a strange dirt road to the location. We had a spacious room and everything seemed clean at first. Barefoot on the floor turned out not to be an option because you could feel the dirt under your feet. In the bathroom we discovered a large ant colony and we were plagued by the many centipedes that walked in. Breakfast is not very spacious but satisfies, service there is very friendly. Dinner is highly recommended, the service did their very best and even received a delicious dessert with candle for my birthday. Unfortunately, our traveling party could not go up and down the stairs and they were lifted to her seat. The chef has even carried her from the chair in the restaurant to her bed. In the meantime, extra pillows were neatly provided so that her foot could be held high, very friendly staff and a top service!\n",
      "INDEX 65  REVIEW   There is nothing to notice about agriturismo here. Think of it more as a small-scale hotel. Correct but without extra frills. We had dinner there ourselves 1 evening. Not immediately recommended. It's worth taking your car and driving for 15 minutes. Friendly, English-speaking service. Don't be put off by the sand track that many describe as extremely difficult. Take it easy. We are two ladies and it went like a piece of cake: wink:\n",
      "INDEX 66  REVIEW   Relieved, you get out of your rental car when you reach the domain. The agriturismo is a bit higher up, not accessible via a paved road. The owner has clearly only just started as there is little agriculture to be found on the site. The rooms are spacious, have air conditioning and are very wheelchair friendly. All in all clean, although here and through you still see a few flaws and minor flaws. In my opinion a bad location as you are fairly isolated. Very minimal in terms of breakfast.\n",
      "INDEX 67  REVIEW   During a tour we came here, we had to search, the location is located between various roads, even with navigation a job. The building has recently been refurbished, but is poorly maintained. Bathroom is not clean, there was leakage somewhere. The room was not dust-free, but now there was a lot of dust outside. The surroundings and grounds are messy, not tidy. The rooms of adequate size. Chairs on the terrace are bad. In short, the accommodation is a 5. After breakfast everyone goes out to the temples, etc. When they return home there is only someone present at 5 pm to sell a beer. The evening meal was good, a set menu with plenty of wine and reasonable quality for 20 €. The whole thing is amateurish. All in all, my assessment was mediocre, something has to change quickly, otherwise it will be a mess within a few years.\n",
      "INDEX 68  REVIEW   This kind of hotel B&B is located 5 km from the Valley of the Temples. An impossible dirt road to get there. Breakfast at 8.30 am At 9 am there was nothing on the table and had little to do with Angriturismo, no local products. Dinner mediocre. Much remains to be done before this location is in order.\n",
      "INDEX 69  REVIEW   Good size rooms. Clean and caring. There is some difference between the rooms. So go and have a look first. This is also offered. We found the food less so as well as the house wine. But we heard positive voices from others as well. It will depend on what you choose. It is a bit remote so eating elsewhere is not really an option.\n",
      "INDEX 70  REVIEW   Go to Agrigento by car? That way! All the sights and everything your heart desires within a 10-minute drive. Fantastic hotel! Breakfasts are prepared by the family living on the ground floor, who welcomes you - homemade ricotta pie made in the morning by the hostess - priceless! The view is just freaky! Do you want to go to the restaurant? In 5 minutes there is a huge supermarket with excellent food, and on the terrace you can arrange an excellent dinner. By the way, if you book through booking, you should know the photos don't lie!\n",
      "INDEX 71  REVIEW   The hotel is in an old, old building, with a very old gate, behind which you can see a beautiful Italian courtyard with a fountain, tiles and stairs. And it is fascinating. Rooms on the second floor, neat and tidy. The location of the hotel is very convenient, in the center of the old town, close to bus stops, promenade, attractions, etc. The streets near the hotel are quite noisy (probably, as in all of Palermo), windows do not save you from noise. The girl who settled us gladly gave all the information we needed, although it was not easy for her, without knowing the language. But, nevertheless, it helped a lot. Thank.\n",
      "INDEX 72  REVIEW   To begin with, the vaunted Navigon took us to the other end of the street. Fortunately, the owner of the hotel, Mr. Gabriel, promptly informed us about the location of the hotel by SMS. The hotel is located practically in the center of Palermo in an old three-storey building on the second floor and consists of a corridor with a reception, 3 or 4 rooms and a breakfast room. When we arrived, Gabriel was waiting for us on the patio terrace. He took us to the room, which was for a family of three, with an extra bed in a separate room. The room has a TV, a wide comfortable bed, a modern bathroom with a shower, a balcony. The windows overlook a quiet narrow street, which makes it possible to have a good rest at night. WiFi perfectly caught only next to the router, the reception in the room was worse. Gabriel advised us where to go, what to see and where to eat. Dissuaded from paid parking, saying that under the windows the car would spend the night well. Breakfast for the B&B was quite rich. During breakfast, Gabrielle brought a delicious juice, a pineapple-banana mixture. I drank this for the first time and praised the juice, to which Gabriel gave us a whole package of this juice at parting. Gabrielle, if you are reading this review, thank you again for your warm welcome!\n",
      "INDEX 73  REVIEW   There is a private parking. Three hundred meters from the hotel there is a wonderful beach: clear water, gentle entrance, soft sand. A very well-worn hotel. The front desk staff does not speak English. Well, just really. Italian only. Because of this, many problems arose: from the discrepancy between the paid room and the one provided to a completely annoying misunderstanding with the so-called compliment of the hotel. On the birthday of one of us, a bottle of wine was brought to the room. And at the time of discharge, it was included in the bill. Not a bad surprise, isn't it? The language barrier is a serious matter. Well, it was limited only to these misunderstandings, but what if there were really big problems? Breakfast is very, very modest: yogurt and a couple of sandwiches. The shower is tiny, the plumbing is making a terrible noise\n",
      "INDEX 74  REVIEW   Well, for starters, I'll say that Mondello is a suburb of Palermo, located literally 20 minutes from the airport, so I recommend staying here for the night for those who have early departures and late arrivals. In addition, Mondello is famous for the fact that even in November they swim in the sea, and television, making reports about the beautiful Sicilian weather, often show the beach of this town. We originally booked a b & b with a different name and more economical. However, upon arrival, it turned out that the owners were managing 2 structures, and they put us in a newer Il Girasole, which was more expensive on booking. I'll start with the downsides: practically none, except that it will be a bit too far to stomp to the beach, which will be inconvenient for young children and the elderly, especially in the hot months. For all other categories, there will be no problems. Positive: new rooms, non-microscopic, as in many resort cities, good interior, cleanliness, the bathroom does not have hygiene kits in micro-bottles, but normal shower gels and shampoos in standard packaging, the place is quiet, only dogs bark at the neighbors :) very welcoming. We left early in the morning, before breakfast, so they brought us a huge plate of fruit in the evening. What is not unimportant for the resort town, there is parking in the yard. In general, I recommend P.S. Very vigilant with personal belongings on the beach, pliz. Before you have time to turn away, the bag will be carried away. Therefore, money and valuables are always with you in a small purse. Is always! And do not leave your husband with bags and children alone on the beach to run to the supermarket. According to observations, husbands concentrating on children do not see how they steal things from under their noses.\n",
      "INDEX 75  REVIEW   Small family hotel with only 4 rooms. The room is spacious enough. Purely. Bathroom and toilet are small. The room, of course, would not hurt to be refurbished, and the furniture and textiles would be freshened up, but the nature of the place, the friendliness of the hostess and the location pay off. Plus, the price is quite reasonable. Breakfast is relatively modest by choice, but tasty and filling (I especially liked the homemade yogurt). Yes, be prepared for the fact that the Internet signal is extremely weak and unstable - practically, only outside the hours of active use of guests, and only in the living-dining room (common area). The air conditioner is working properly, the mattress is hardish. It will be very noisy outside at night and in the morning - stock up on earplugs.\n",
      "INDEX 76  REVIEW   Very convenient location: not far from the train station, close to historical sights. All rooms are renovated, everything is decorated with great taste, every detail is thought out, equipment and furniture are new, in the kitchen for guests there is a refrigerator, stove, dishes, in the room there is a kettle and a mini-refrigerator, in the shower there is music. Everything is very clean, towels are changed daily, for breakfast - freshly squeezed orange juice, great coffee. Very friendly staff, things can be left before departure at the reception.\n",
      "INDEX 77  REVIEW   Located in the old quarter of Palermo, two minutes from the Teatro Massimo and close to the main street! Free parking under the window, it was important to me! The hosts are hospitable, always with a smile, the atmosphere is super! Breakfasts are ordinary, but for a week I did not get tired of them. Thanks for a wonderful stay! I definitely recommend it!\n",
      "INDEX 78  REVIEW   Excellent hotel near the train station and near the center and the marina. Rooms with balconies, large bathroom, everything is new. Hot breakfast, fruits. Late check-in is possible, the keys are then taken from the safe.\n",
      "INDEX 79  REVIEW   Thank you for a wonderful stay at your home. Very stylish rooms with wonderful paintings, crafts! You can immediately see how the owners love their job! View from the window to the garden with orange and olive trees, where birds sing wonderfully. The hostess and her husband are very hospitable and kind! I loved the lemon pie at breakfast!\n",
      "INDEX 80  REVIEW   Very good typical Sicilian breakfast with lots of sweets, but also bread, cheese and ham. Despite not having on-site parking, the B&B provides free parking in a location close to 100m. Very attentive service.\n",
      "INDEX 81  REVIEW   All communication was done in English by email and the reservation was very easy. We arrived easily at the place and the owner welcomed us. He showed us where to park (private, free, inside the property), the pool, the breakfast place, how to open and close the gate and our room. He also left us a contact number. The room was very spacious, dye a double and a single bed, minibar, air conditioning, large bathroom and a balcony overlooking the internal garden. The location is great for visiting Agrigento historic center, Valle dei Templi and Scala dei Turchi. We stayed 1 night, but we recommend 2 nights to enjoy the area, attractions and beautiful beaches close by. Would go back to that hotel!\n",
      "INDEX 82  REVIEW   For a 3 star the service is excellent and the rooms have excellent space, but as the hotel was on the corner of two busy streets at night the noise of cars honking and chattering makes it difficult to sleep well. Breakfast without an express machine, to be served at will, not accessible to guests, just that unbearable American coffee !! Super-attentive staff !!\n",
      "INDEX 83  REVIEW   Hotel very well located, close to the center, with easy access to the main tourist points. At first glance the hotel appears to be very old, with an old facade and old reception, however, the room is very new and spacious. Modest breakfast, but with everything necessary. I highly recommend it!\n",
      "INDEX 84  REVIEW   I have been a tourism professional for 38 years, I made a group for Sicily and Malta and we stayed at this hotel. The safe in my room was stolen by the hotel staff, we complained and nothing worked. The reception manager said that to open the room safe you need a master key that is kept by the general manager and with code, LIE, a member of my group had problems with the safe and an employee went to the room and opened the safe. We went to the Italian Police, we registered the incident and according to the Police, there are already several occurrences against the hotel. Therefore, a hotel that steals a guest safe does not deserve anyone's preference, especially when it has a complaint and the hotel does not help to solve anything.\n",
      "INDEX 85  REVIEW   We made our reservation based on good reviews, but our experience was quite different from what we expected. From the photos provided by the inn, we expected a very different room. First because we booked a superior room, second because we never expected a room as dirty and poorly maintained as the one available to us. I will not go into details of other points that were unpleasant, such as the check-in without anyone to receive, which was notified to us 2 days before the stay, among others. The room problem was enough to never stay here again. The situation of the room is unbelievable, the hostel is not honest to post a photo and provide you with something completely different. If it weren't for the time we arrived, I would have looked for another hotel. I have never slept in such a mess in my life. The photos speak for themselves. Detail of the ticket that explains the positive reviews. I will probably have a rude response from the hostel like everyone who does a negative review. They do not understand how much a criticism can help them if they are willing to correct it.\n",
      "INDEX 86  REVIEW   I liked the Hotel, a little used a lot, but still meeting the needs. Its location is out of town, but very good. It is in a seaside area and with excellent restaurants in the neighborhood. Breakfast in the Italian standard.\n",
      "INDEX 87  REVIEW   On this trip to Italy I was hosted in 9 different places. In this one, without a doubt, I found a true gentleman, Mr Giuseppe. He came to welcome us in the courtyard, where we parked the car, helped with the bags, gave us all the attention and information about the city, restaurants, etc. The room was excellent, with two settings and well isolated from noise. Breakfast is hearty and of excellent quality. Being in Palermo I have no doubt where to stay. Attention: if you are arriving at the weekend, do not be alarmed by the restricted street, as local cars can drive. Grazie Guiseppe, arrivederci!\n",
      "INDEX 88  REVIEW   We spent two days in Palermo, Sicily, and stayed at this excellent establishment. The owner is very attentive, serving with chivalry and dedication to all guests. In addition, it spontaneously provides several sightseeing tips, best restaurants and prices. It is always available. During our stay, we even prepared sandwiches for our return trip, since we were going to the airport before breakfast started. The accommodations are spacious, very well maintained and the breakfast, prepared by Marco (the owner) is good. Worth it.\n",
      "INDEX 89  REVIEW   good B&B, the owner was very friendly, we liked her very much, she prepared one of the best cappuccinos we had in Sicily, the hotel is very centralized, a few meters from the main street, I believe there was a mosque on the street because there were many Muslims, which it made the environment even more interesting. I recommend!\n",
      "INDEX 90  REVIEW   We were here in April 2014. Location very good, close to the port and the center of Trapani. Room very cozy and clean. Sweet breakfasts, but always fresh and delicious. The owner is very helpful, willing to advise what and where to buy, see and eat. Decent prices. We recommend !!!\n",
      "INDEX 91  REVIEW   Very nice and clean rooms in the heart of the old town of Trapani - good value for money. An intimate atmosphere and Italian atmosphere. Very nice and competent reception staff - Lorena grazie mile per tutti! A big plus is also the free airport transfer, very nice and punctual driver.\n",
      "INDEX 92  REVIEW   The apartment was clean and cleaned basically every day, once a week with change of towels and sheets, comfortable bed, kitchenette with gas stove and fridge. Bathroom clean, shower a bit tight. The bedroom was on the first floor on the mezzanine and the descent is quite breakneck. The surprise is the practical lack of windows, because what is difficult to define - rather a barrel. Sweet breakfasts plus fruit, yogurt, cereals and drinks. The staff uses English - some people get along better, but they can do it and are willing to help. Hassle-free transfer from to the airport. And the location in the middle of old Trapani, close to the port, fish market, bus stops and everything else. For globetrotters who do not expect luxury.\n",
      "INDEX 93  REVIEW   A city hotel, very well located, in the heart of the old town of Trapani. Close to everything, yet quiet street and no noise. Bed linen, clean towels changed every 2 days. Nice helpful staff. Comfortable bathroom, warm water always. For families with small children no, but for adults who want to explore the city and its surroundings, I recommend Italian breakfasts, which means a lot of sweets, but you will choose something. Delicious coffee.\n",
      "INDEX 94  REVIEW   I highly recommend this hotel. The apartment is identical to the pictures - spacious, clean, modern and equipped. Great contact with the manager from the very beginning. Very efficient booking, I immediately received confirmation of the transfer received. We were there after midnight - there was no problem with that. The manager was waiting for us with a smile - she gave us a lot of information about visiting Trapani and the surrounding area, sunbathing, excursions, shopping, bars and restaurants, getting around Trapani and parking places. Everything was perfect! Thank you for a great stay.\n",
      "INDEX 95  REVIEW   I recommend the place and the owners. There is nothing needed for everyday functioning. Daily cleaning, cleanliness, friendly atmosphere. Comfort of rest as much as possible, in case of any problems the owners will help you in every matter, convenient location. I recommend to everyone!!!\n",
      "INDEX 96  REVIEW   The very good location of this apartment allows you to get to know the city itself from its inside as it is located in the very center of the baroque Trapani. Close (less than 10 minutes with a light walk) from here to the port from where ships depart for the Egadi Islands or for thematic cruises around this archipelago. In the evening, the city comes alive with many openings, and during the day it is pleasant here. The apartamernt I stayed in was of a very good standard. Air conditioning, internet, fridge, kitchenette, nice bathroom, spacious room and most importantly a MEGA COMFORTABLE BED !!! For those who want to spend their vacation in Trapani, it is a recommendable place :))) The owners will certainly rise to the occasion and treat each client individually! Another advantage of this apartemern and Trapani itself is the fact that with a good planning of your holiday you can see a lot here without renting a car, because the masto is well connected with other surrounding cities by a network of railways or buses. And in the above-mentioned port, the Egads are waiting for us :))\n",
      "INDEX 97  REVIEW   What can I say - great location, everything sparkles with cleanliness, great view from the window, the owners of the wonderful, feel the atmosphere of Italy! Go and see for yourself! In addition to the apartments from Ola and Angelo, he can find out what to see and visit and where to go out in the evening and eat well! Thanks for everything!\n",
      "INDEX 98  REVIEW   Apartamenty znajdują się w doskonałej lokalizacji w sercu Starego Miasta. Codzienne sprzątanie plus pralka to duży atut. Właściciele bardzo pomocni nie tylko w kwestiach lokalowych ale również doradzą gdzie zjeść i co zobaczyć:) Bardzo polecamy usługi Angelo Apartments i dziękujemy za wspólnie spędzony czas.\n",
      "INDEX 99  REVIEW   TWO BIG ADVANTAGES OF THE APARTMENT: careful care of the owners, especially Mrs. Ola. We received a lot of invaluable tips, assistance in renting a car, booking a transfer to Palermo airport and nearby islands. we felt commitment and sensitivity to our needs. Thank you very much, Mrs. Ola! . And the second advantage is the great location in the center of the historic old town, in a quiet street but near the main pedestrian street full of pubs serving really good food. Through the balcony, angels from the wall of a magnificent Baroque church looked at us - isn't it beautiful?\n"
