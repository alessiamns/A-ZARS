hotel is nicely located. Not out on Ortigia, where it's harder to get to. On the 3rd floor there is a nice balcony overlooking the city. A couple of the rooms have their own balcony (we tried that, nice). Renovated a few years ago and well maintained. The breakfast could well be more exciting, but is good enough. The location right by the bridges over to Ortigia means that you can quickly get to both sides. Many interesting new restaurants in the neighborhood, not many steps away. Most of them are better than the tourist traps on the peninsula.","1":"The only good thing one can say about this hotel is that it is well located. Everything else is awful. The rooms in no way live up to either pictures or descriptions. On arrival they did not have our reservations so we were given just two rooms with the promise of getting new rooms the next morning. Of course, this did not happen. Then we were promised that it would happen later, which did not happen either. Wifi does not work in the room, air-con can not be turned off and makes noise and the bathrooms smell pretty bad. The breakfast is by no means something to shout hurray for, so all in all a really disappointing stay for way too much money.","2":"A wonderful little hotel that is very centrally located. Only 5 min walk to Ortiga. Free parking right outside the hotel. We got a very nice and cozy room with a beautiful balcony right next to the harbor. Bathing is possible 2 min from the hotel.","3":"This hotel is surrounded by fields. There are no airports, no pool disco, no highways, but lots of leisurely pace. We mostly had the pool to ourselves, in the middle of July! That is, when we were not on snorkeling trips in the marine reserve in the area, or visited cozy, local restaurants on Ortigia in Syracuse.","4":"This small hotel located in the old town of Siracusa (Ortigia) is a really nice place and central to everything in Ortigia. The host couple - Antonio and his sister - and the staff are wonderfully friendly and helpful. The hotel is a bit worn but clean and tidy. To the rear there are lovely terraces, but the view is to an old Italian district. It is completely quiet at the same time. The rooms on the street side may have a little traffic noise, but it is not a busy street. If you want peace and quiet and want to stay centrally in Ortigia, then this hotel can be recommended. The breakfast buffet is typically Italian.","6":"Here you will find a small oasis just inside the city walls. A really nice hotel, good service, good rooms with good space, clean and nice in the upper part of the scale. Super delicious breakfast. It is not possible to park a car outside the hotel, but the staff picks up and brings the car, and the same applies to the luggage, so leave it safely to them. Reception, stairs and rooms are carved and built into the rock wall, so you do not have to be a bad walker. Precisely due to the cliff incorporation, the hotel has a fantastic atmosphere, almost a bit cave-like, and at the same time a good view of the rock valley the city is surrounded by.","7":"The hotel is in a green setting but there is nothing to see right in the neighborhood. You have to use a car to get out and see something (and even though it does not look like many km, the roads are winding and bumpy). The hotel itself is fine with large rooms which are clean and neat. We only tried the pasta at the restaurant as we did not want the whole day's menu. The pasta was excellent and it was cozy on their terrace in the evening. The breakfast offers a little of everything, but gets a little boring after a few days - it will be nice with a little variety. Sweet reception by the receptionist when we arrived and she spoke fine English.","8":"We have stayed here for a week and enjoyed every single day. The rooms are big and delicious, all are different, ours looked like a cozy cave. Very nice and clean, free minibar and generally really good room service.\nThe pool area is very tasteful and there are both lounge and sun loungers and the opportunity to retreat in the shade under one of the beautiful trees.\n\nThe breakfast is really delicious, there are exaggerated many options for cake and sweet bread, but also lots of fruit, almonds and yogurt. There is a large selection of juices, teas and coffee drinks. Everything is fresh and nicely decorated.\n\nThe staff is really sweet and service minded and solves all the queries we have come up with. Some have more local knowledge than others, but we have been given some really good advice.\n\nThe hotel is quiet, even though it is in the middle of the city. 10 min. walk from the old town (NOTE that there are really many stairs and steep roads in the city). There are restaurants and sights on all sides of the hotel.","9":"We stayed there all 10 days we were in Sicily.\nAnd we enjoyed having this place as a base for all our experiences. The room was large and the mix between old-fashioned and modern was wonderfully matched. Everything worked and it was nice and clean.\nBut the best thing about the place were the amazing hosts - Elena helped us with inspiration and tips for both the city and the area. She booked olive oil tasting for us and she provided lovely breakfast on their roof terrace overlooking Ragusa. Pickup in a slightly remote parking lot was done in their original and absolutely stunning Fiat 500 station wagon.\nWe were so happy that we chose to stay here all the time and would recommend others to use them as a base. They are so helpful and at the same time discreet and professional.","10":"Good location in the middle of the old town\nClean and tastefully decorated. Good beds, bad pillows. Lovely soft rug. Friendly service when we arrived we were directed to 3 different rooms from which we could choose what we wanted. A large room with ample space and cozy little balcony.\nOne minus was so close we lived with a local family who were very noisy. A dog that barked and did not care that we got there.\nThe last star they could have gotten if the breakfast was good but it was lousy. Poorly inedible dry bread and dry salted cheese. A toaster could help a little\nThe service in the breakfast restaurant was sweet and friendly.","11":"This summer we visited lovely La Scibina for the second time in 3 years and it was a lovely reunion with an extremely well run hotel. Our hotel room is actually a 2-storey apartment with space for 4 people. There is a private terrace and balcony, which means even more choices for staying in the hotel, and the apartment itself is furnished with a kitchen and two bathrooms.\nThe hotel offers a nice breakfast with just the coffee specialties you want, and then there is a huge garden \/ pool area, and everything is nice and good.\nThe staff and the proprietor make holidays at La Scibina something very special and I would encourage everyone to visit this wonderful hotel.","12":"We stayed in the villa with 14 people at the end of April-beginning of May. The house has been extensively modernized to a very high standard and offers everything your heart desires. The rooms are spacious and elegantly furnished. The garden is like a park, the parking lot is absolutely secure and everything from swimming pool to whirlpool, sauna and cellar bar is available. The restaurant offers very good dishes. Although the service wasn't perfect on the first evening, it was given 5 stars, because Antonella in particular tried (and she succeeded) to avoid the coordination problems from the second evening and to handle everything to our greatest satisfaction. The entire team was extremely committed and spoiled us with a lot of charm! An incredible place that we will return to for sure !!! Thank you so much!","13":"Unfortunately no own parking spaces --- so look on the street ... very friendly hostess and the breakfast was good for the B&B - room quality is ok - unfortunately very conveniently located ... (from 5.30 a.m.) to the ferry it is about 1.2 km","14":"To be recommended without reservation! The spacious rooms and bathrooms are brand new, luxurious, contemporary and elegant, in the old Palazzo, in the center of the pedestrian zone, rather quiet, very quiet at night. 9 rooms and a 24-hour reception, you know who is going in and out. The journey (in Palermo not recommended by car) worked with the help of the phone and pick-up from a place. Restaurant recommendations, individual tours and even a very early (fantastic) breakfast were no problem in this loving Sicilian hospitality. Many many thanks!","15":"The hotel is in a very good location: the airport bus is almost around the corner, to the cathedral about 15-20 minutes. on foot. The decor is spartan, but typically Italian (shiny tiled floor, kitschy curtains, no unnecessary chi-chi). We didn't notice anything of the partially reported clairaudience, only the construction site was in front of the window - even on Sunday morning! - loud, but the hotel can't help it. Very good extensive breakfast for Italian standards! Very friendly staff! I can recommend it","17":"We had our room on the right side of the hallway, it was very small and not very practical with two huge suitcases. The walls were made of paper, when the neighbors were in the room we could hear every word. However, the air conditioning was gold with such high temperatures and the room service was great every day! The location was also great, only a 5-minute walk to the Theatro Massimo and the trendy district. Now for the miserable part: the breakfast buffet! In no way does it do justice to a 4 star hotel - more appropriate for a 1 star hotel. There was no fresh bread, only pre-packaged milk rolls and a rock-hard baguette. Sausage, ham and cheese in the showcase, as well as sliced \u200b\u200btomatoes on the plate looked like they had been there for 3 days. There was also scrambled eggs that looked very soggy and mushy. Furthermore, a larger selection of cakes and muffins, chocolate pops and cornflakes. Sometimes there was some fruit in the basket. The freshly squeezed orange juice (as it is large on a blackboard) is a thick sugar juice from the supermarket. The staff at breakfast as well as at the front desk were friendly and always helpful!","19":"The two hotel managers Federico and Filippo have everything under control: the transfer to the airport went very well. The breakfast in the neighboring caffee was excellent and the rooms were in top shape. The room service was also outstanding. We were completely satisfied and would be happy to come back.","20":"We were picked up by Federico, the manager, we hadn't found the address in the pedestrian area straight away. He also organized the parking garage and gave useful tips for dinner. The palazzo and our studio were immaculately clean and tasteful, the beds super comfortable. Everything was newly renovated and nothing was spared, everything from the finest, wonderful marble on the floor. Great bed linen, everything very appetizing. In the middle of the city and breakfast in a bar, like the Italians. We will be back.","21":"The hotel is well located, the room was nice and large (with a kitchen and lounge). However, the following points should be noted: On Sundays the reception was unoccupied, entry was after a phone call, key was ready. The breakfast is very (!) Modest (machine coffee, machine fruit juice, rusks, crackers).","22":"Problematic access to the second floor, as the elevator (god forbid, as in practice it is just a freight carrier), wants a key that you must go up first to get it from the second. The room we got was an imposing high ceiling facing the via etnea. The location is quite crowded on the sidewalks and at night the area has several restaurants to go out. Large TV with pay-per-view channels. However, the corridor until you reach the room (for which you cross the dining room) is narrow and with walls full of moisture. The bathroom is unknown because it was very noisy every time you used water or pulled a cistern and with a bad smell at times. The children at the reception are very friendly and helpful (without their smile and interest the score would be lower). Parking if you are lucky on the street. We stayed 1 night and I can not say it was a bad night. But I have definitely felt more beautiful in other hotels in terms of price ..","23":"Large and beautiful apartment, with a beautiful view, the dome and the bell tower of the cathedral. It is located in the center of the historic center, close to buses, shops, the main square etc .... Beautifully decorated with taste and clean. His breakfast, good! Everything you need to start your day. As for the heating, he has to put another air conditioner (in the apartment where we lived), because in such a large apartment, and with so much humidity that Catania has, only one stove is enough. Francesco is very kind and helpful. Very helpful !!!","24":"The accommodation was perfect (clean rooms, healthy breakfast, very close to the city but also very close to the city exit) Toto the owner of the accommodation very hospitable and helpful in everything. We thank him very much ...","25":"Very nice room and clean! the staff very helpful! Everything is very close to the hotel! Nice breakfast and at a very good price the apartment! All the best in definitely worth staying here!","26":"It is unacceptable as a hotel because it does not observe the hours when there should be quiet and there is noise. They are constantly heard to be carrying furniture even from 5 in the morning, shame, because when you come to Palermo for a vacation you want to rest and calm down. Only breakfast is good but needs reinforcement to make it excellent.","27":"One of the worst hotels I have ever visited. Very dirty, perforated sheets, taps to run minimal space to sit on the ground floor and without wi fi. Miserable and poor breakfast. Nevertheless, it is characterized by 4 stars. If an agency suggests it away.","28":"The hotel is in a great location. On the marina, overlooking Ortygia, from which it is less than 15 minutes walk. Comfortable parking space in front of the hotel. The rooms on the first floor (where I stayed) are spacious and clean, but with very minimal furniture (they do not even have a closet, despite a hanger rod in the space). The beds are small and the mattresses are hard. Kind and willing staff. The breakfasts have fresh croissants, but they are very poor (without salty tray). It can not be considered a three star hotel.","29":"After arriving at Catania airport and after an hour of driving, we found it relatively easily with gps.\nFree Parking just below Ficodindia.\nThe b & b is located on the second floor of the building.\nThe owner welcomed us and after he offered us coffee, he explained everything to us about where to go and what to see in Syracuse!\n\nRooms; Probably the most pleasant and clean we have left!\nBeautiful, simple and very comfortable with all amenities.\nRoom Air Condition new and quiet!\nBathroom ? Large and clean. Bottles with shampoo - shower and lots of clean towels.\nBalcony in your room but also next to the living room to go out to drink your coffee and spend your time with the free fast wi-fi.\nBreakfast simple but pleasant. Fresh local products tarts, cookies, jams, cakes and more.\nDaily fresh croissants with pistachio or chocolate\nalong with espresso or cappuccino is perfect\nto start your day in Syracuse!\nThere is a large super market 30 m opposite for everything you need.\n\nWell done to the two owners brothers, we will recommend it to those who ask us where to stay in Beautiful Syracuse.\n\nKonstantinos & Athens - Greece (31\/8\/2015 - 2\/9\/2015)","30":"Miserable and poor quality breakfast, staff behavior at breakfast from rude to poor. Quality food at dinner far below average. Reception of staff in reception and room service very good.","31":"Room mediocre on the roof but at least it was clean with the owners Luka and Angelo very hospitable and very willing to give information and help, mediocre breakfast. What is worth is their hospitality and position in relation to what is of interest in the city","32":"We loved our stay in Trapani! The hotel was faultless- full of history, spotlessly clean, fabulous location and the breakfast balcony simply stunning!!! Service was very friendly and professional. We wish we stayed for longer.","33":"LocaTion was excellent. Staff recommended very good restaurants and made reservations for us. Breakfast could offer more variety but was good. Pickup and drop off at airport Was priced ok and was much appreciated. Hotel is clean and comfortable but not fancy. Room is a bit small. Still a good price for a great location.","35":"Exemplary stay - from the moment we checked in, we were warmly welcomed, given great recommendations on where to park, restaurant recommendations and help with reservations, and even a towel to go to the free beach right outside the door. The welcome drink is a glass of Prosecco... Shower head can be adjusted to be a rain shower, and there is a good makeup mirror. Well equipped with good espresso machine and nice toiletries. The fantastic location near to the beach and on the main restaurant shopping strip, along with great client service akin to almost a concierge, makes this hotel a great place to stay - wholeheartedly recommend.","36":"We had a wonderful stay at the Delle Vittorie. Our room was very clean and comfortable with a very pleasing decor. Our room was quiet and Air conditioning worked well. Breakfast had all the usual Items, fruit, yogourt, eggs, cereal and most importantly the best Cannoli. The staff ( two twin sisters)were always very helpful and and pleasant to deal with. I really think you would be pleased with this property.","37":"We spent two nights here. A wonderful hotel. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The room was clean. We had a junior suite with terrace. We had our own private terrace with lounge chairs, umbrellas and tables. Our room also had a little kitchen area with a table and chairs. The hotel is located by the sea. There is a sandy beach behind the hotel. Walk along the boardwalk to the stairs down to the beach.The hotel is alo near all the restaurants and shops. A great place to stay","38":"Very pleased with our stay at Residence La Gancia. Easy walking distance to restaurants and nightlife, ferries, historical points. The staff here is excellent and goes above and beyond to make your stay comfortable.Our breakfast every morning at the rooftop dining area was superb as were the views and service. Same for our pre-dinner wine and spritzes on the rooftop. Parking is the only slight hassle. We dropped off our car as directed in the public 24 7 lot and it was a 5-10 min walk back to the hotel. Highly recommended!","40":"We stayed one night in this beautiful hotel by the sea in Trapani. You can park your car nearby, in public parking with coins. The hotel is nice , our room had a great view over the sea. Breakfast is delicious and served in the terrace overlooking the sea. Highly recommended!!","41":"All around great hotel and location with exceptional breakfast. Very nice evening bar presentation and snacks. Hotel arranged for airport transportation that was nicely done. We would definitely stay here again.","42":"Hotel located in the heart of Palermo. The room was comfortable, spacious, and clean. Very friendly, helpful and attentive staff. The hotel has paid parking nearby. It serves a full buffet breakfast.","43":"Hotel very well located on the main street of the historic center. It allows visiting the most interesting monuments and areas on foot. On the other hand, you have to leave the car in the hotel parking lot that they park for you, taking away your freedom to take it whenever you want. To access the ha itacuones you have to take 2 elevators with 6 stairs between them. For people with reduced mobility uncomfortable. Very spacious and modern room. It does not have international TV. Little varied breakfast","44":"Simona and Bianca are two wonderful, kind and helpful women who made our days in Messina unforgettable. The place is located on a pedestrian street just a few meters from the cathedral. Comfort details: it has a lift, there is free wi-fi, breakfast is served diligently by Simona in a lovely dining room. As we went in low season and we wanted separate beds we were given a room for each person. They give information about what one demands and above all, getting off and being in the bars and restaurants area is precious, in addition to the fact that the tourist buses can be taken in front of the cathedral. It is not noisy since it has double windows and the interior, in turn, with double glass. I highly recommend it.","45":"The hotel is very run-down, the aesthetics often reveal the low maintenance. Standard rooms are so small that 2 open suitcases cannot fit in at the same time. And breakfast ... the options should not only be for people who eat sweets, puddings, croissants and processed. The variety is very poor.","46":"Excellent location. Only if you go by vehicle the GPS can be disorienting since it is located in a pedestrian block. You can park in a garage 300 meters from the Hotel but when I tried to use it I couldn't because it was Sunday and it was closed. The option to leave the car on the street without problems as it is very safe. \u20ac 0.50 cards are used for the half hour that the owner of the hotel kindly gave me. Bars and restaurant attached to the hotel. The B&B is very clean and neat. Very basic breakfast but enough to continue the day. Acceptable option in Messina.","47":"Looking for a nice place to spend my holidays in Sicily, I found the Sillitti farm. In my ignorance I thought ... where the hell is Caltanissetta? And I realized that it was more or less in the heart of Sicily; but the truth in my heart has been engraved the kindness and character of this family that opens the doors of their home to share their life with you in their day to day. The atmosphere is ideal to relax and forget about city stress, take a dip in the pool and enjoy the pure air of the country. Ah !!! and if your idea is to try homemade Sicilian food, here you will taste delicacies from breakfast to dinner. The house and the rooms are very comfortable, without forgetting the neatness and order with which they maintain all the facilities. The landscape is charming, added to the hospitality of Silvia and Bruno, nothing is better to spend a perfect vacation.","48":"It is not easy to find good accommodation in Messina. The Lepanto is centrally located, the facilities are reasonably good and offers a correct breakfast. No more. The price a little high for the quality it offers.","49":"Located far from the center, difficult to find, soulless and unattractive room, poor decoration, strong smell of humidity, very bad mattress and pillows. No heating in the bathroom, the old cigar almost transparent hand towels, the shower, scant in size. Nice views of the Strait of Messina and friendly owners, but that doesn't make up for the poor quality of the accommodation. For dinner, you have to travel several kilometers, there are no nearby restaurants. Terrible breakfast, office coffee and industrial pastries, there was no fresh bread.","51":"I came to Palermo with the idea of \u200b\u200bvisiting the place of my ancestors. It was our first time in a B&B and I must say that it was highly satisfactory. Roberta is extremely attentive and will personally take care of all your wishes. Mine in particular was to re-try the tenerumi soup (a Sicilian pumpkin) that my grandmother prepared for me when I was a child. I mentioned it to Roberta and incredibly she spoke with the manager of a trattoria located a few blocks from the hotel and that same night we were having dinner the typical pasta that my nonna prepared for me. The breakfasts are very good but what makes the difference is the attention of this woman who is in all the details. The hotel is very well located just two blocks from the beach and 6 from the main square.","52":"Nice, very friendly welcome from the manager A nice, clean and functional room in a house with tasteful decor Breakfast 2 steps away in a caf\u00e9 B\u00e9mol all the same to sensitive ears: the location of some rooms overlook a street with a lot of traffic ... I recommend !","53":"Superb stopover in a mini-palace-style villa. Very friendly and relaxed welcome, by Enrico, the owner. Accommodation in a small g\u00eete just above the villa. From the terrace, splendid view of the sea, especially in the evening with the sunset lighting up the Italian coast. Highly recommend!","54":"Four extremely pleasant days in this boutique hotel near the center of Palermo. Alessandro's attention to his guests is constant. Very atypical places - a mixture of modern and (very) old. Spacious bedrooms and bathrooms. Excellent breakfast - for foodies and heavy eaters :-)","56":"Close to the center of Palermo, in a fairly typical neighborhood, the owner will give you a warm welcome. The rooms are spacious and comfortable, the breakfast very generous, the price quite reasonable.","57":"What a warm welcome from Alessendro and his team. From the moment we arrive we feel at home. The decoration of the hotel is original. We stayed 3 nights. Alessendro knows his city perfectly and advises us on the visits to be made and the restaurants in the surroundings that are worth discovering. Our host speaks French which allows us to exchange even more easily. Breakfasts are varied and accessible over a long time slot. Thank you again for this stay which ended our trip to Sicily","58":"Excellent welcome from Enrico who speaks good French, always pleasant. Very comfortable bedding, spacious bedrooms, large bathroom, varied and generous breakfasts. Beautiful sea view. Recommended.","60":"What positive! 5 star service and great kindness! High quality breakfast prepared with care (fresh fruit, croissants, etc.), pleasant room, ideal location. In short, go ahead with your eyes closed","62":"After a long search I found this B&B. At first I was worried because of the location - the building is of heavy road traffic in Messina - but everything turned out to be so good in this B&B that it was worth it. It is located on one of the higher floors so you don't hear too much traffic. The room we stayed in was really comfortable beds (to be honest, the most comfortable beds I have slept in during my entire Sicily travels); air conditioning; Wifi; a fully refurbished bathroom with modern amenities and rain shower. It is overall very cleabn, and even had a small kitchenette which we didn't use. The room is bright but it can be completely dark with the closing of the shades. The staff are incredibly courteous and helpful. The breakfast room is bright and has an ocean view. My only comment is, that there could have been a little more choice for breakfast, like fresh fruit and maybe some cheeses. . . But that's really a detail, I was overall very happy with this place and will definitely be back.","63":"The stay was fantastic, the room has every comfort and is very comfortable, it is in a great location and the staff is very friendly for every need! The wi-fi service, the air conditioning, the TV ... All functional !!! The bathroom is large with a spacious shower ... you deserve 5 stars!","65":"It is well located being only 10 minutes from the train station and close to the old quarters of Messina. Our host Fabio and his partner are very charming people who went out of their way to help us. The room was modern, with a small balcony overlooking the main street. It was still quiet. The room was clean and comfortable with a large rose shower head. Free Wifi is provided as well as a good continental breakfast. My only criticism is that there was no safe in the room.","66":"Very nice and comfortable B&B. Rooms furnished in a modern style and with good taste, very clean and complete with TV, wi-fi and air conditioning. The owner very helpful and kind. I recommend it over for the one just described and located in a beautiful and strategic point of the city.","67":"The only thing I didn't like about this B&B is that we had to leave after our 4 day stay. Everything was EXCELLENT. The owner Fabio, his staff Vittoria and Franco could not have been more accommodating and made our stay very comfortable. Our room had a street view with a balcony and the breakfast room on the other side had a balcony overlooking the sea. It was wonderful to have breakfast on that balcony every day. There was a good variety of food at breakfast including hard boiled eggs which is unthinkable in Italy. The room was exceptionally clean and not small, the bed was very comfortable, great A \/ C, small fridge, lots of closet space, the bathroom was a good size and a great deal of restaurants and tourist attractions within walking distance. We recommend this place 1000% and we thank Fabio and his staff for making us feel welcome. We will definitely stay here again when in Messina.","69":"B&B located near the port and convenient to reach the center. Located on the top floor of a double-facing building, you can get a harbor view room or a city center view. Comfortable rooms, bathroom ok, simple breakfast and service always attentive to customer needs. In the area there are several restaurants and the parking spaces for cars after 20:00 are free on the street. Stayed several times, I recommend it.","70":"Brand new rooms, satisfactory cleaning, brand new furniture, latest generation bathroom with hydromassage shower, flat screen TV, Wi-Fi and air conditioning, fairly central area with parking facilities. Absolutely correct price.","71":"I have been for three days on busy occasions. The hospitality was perfect. I arrived in the morning and they did everything to give me the room as soon as possible and in the meantime they offered me breakfast. The next morning I had to leave early and the young owner came on purpose to give me breakfast .. Really all very kind and hospitable. The location is very convenient because it is close to the station, the port and the center and offers a beautiful view of the port and the strait.","72":"It was the last hotel in Sicily so I was quite accustomed to the style, so there was no problem, but this is also a hotel without staff except for check-in and breakfast. I had called in advance, so I waited at the hotel in time to arrive a little earlier. I think it's the best place to visit the city of Catania. Take the airport bus (ALIBUS), get off at STESICORO bus stop, and walk for about 5 minutes on a straight line. The building entrance is unlocked by entering a code, so you can experience the atmosphere of a residence. The lock code will not be given to you in advance, so you must call or email the owner. The room was quite fashionable and had a color scheme based on white, TV with unusually many channels (there was also Rakuten TV), a moody shower room, and the taste of the owner was strongly felt. It feels like the space and amenities are sufficient. The security box needs to be reset immediately after using it. This time it was not reset. Confirmation is required when there is staff (when explaining the room). I gave up because I was checking out early in the morning, but it seems to deliver breakfast to my room after 7:30. ALIBUS runs about every 30 minutes, but if you feel uncertain about the time, you can call a taxi. 25 euros is a reasonable amount in the sense of avoiding rip-offs, and it will arrive in about 10 minutes. I think ALIBUS is also faster because the distance to the airport is shorter than the outbound route. It seems that taxi is recommended on the weekends because the bus street is crowded with beach guests. It is not the cheapest hotel in Sicily, but I think it is a reasonable amount considering the convenience and design.","75":"Arrived at Palermo Airport around 8pm and arrived at Trapani by rental car around 22:00. The hotel has no parking and had to pay a few euros on the street parking meter in the morning. If you are worried, you should prepare about 5 euros of coins because you can only use coins. At first the hotel door was closed. When I called the place written at the entrance, I was told in English that \"please wait there\". The old man who greeted me at the entrance didn't speak English, so it was difficult to understand how to use the room, how to use and open the key, and when the next free morning would end the free parking time. The elevator was small, slow and inconvenient. The room itself was clean, so it may be okay if you just sleep like this time. But if I have a long stay, I wanted to stay in a brighter hotel.","79":"The apartment is in a very good location in the old town, with a beautiful sea view from the sea view room. I felt it was too large for two people to use (there was a good distance from the bed and sofa to the TV. There was enough space to open two suitcases), but the room was very clean because it was renovated and new. It's an apartment, so there's a kitchen, so you can buy food yourself and enjoy cooking (I didn't do it because there are many bars and restaurants nearby).\nIt is in a very good location for walking around the old town and the old town. Although it is on a busy street, it was not too noisy on the seaview side, and the sound of the waves was clearly heard.\nSince there is no parking lot, it was a little difficult to find a parking place nearby.","80":"I chose it as a hotel by the harbor to go to Levanze Island the next day to see the cave paintings.\nAs you know, after check-in, you will be given 3 keys.\nIt is the key of the building containing the B\/B, the key of the floor used, and the key of the room. Paul was a kind and polite owner who taught me in detail, but when I went out and tried to enter the floor, I was lucky enough to come to the rescue when I was playing with a clatter without listening to what the key said. The room was large and quiet at night and the guests were two French couples who arrived late at night. Breakfast includes several types of Italian bread, juice, coffee, etc.\nIt's simple, but the users all seem to be staying for a long time, and there are all cooking facilities. There is no reason not to use this well.\nI will use this book B\/B again when I go to the Egardi Islands, which I missed this time.","83":"A car can be parked on site, although advance reservation is required. The road to go is narrow, so I think a smaller car is better. The room had a high ceiling and was very beautiful, and I could see the sea from the window.","86":"This is a family-run heart-warming B&B. It was introduced by the inn of the previous night. You can walk from Catania Train Station. Toilet\/shower is located outside the room, but each room has its own bathroom. Breakfast is served in the kitchen. The conversation with the travelers during breakfast was also fun and everyone said that this inn was wonderful. When I go to Catania, I definitely want to use it again. I was informed that the B&B would send me to the airport for a fee, but I declined because the city bus of 1 euro was available from the immediate vicinity. However, the day I headed to the airport was Sunday, there were no buses, and I regret refusing the B&B offer. (I'm afraid, but I reached the airport by myself)","87":"I booked in advance and stayed for 2 nights in a dormitory. It is a very convenient place for sightseeing, well equipped and the courtyard has a good atmosphere. It was a pity that the number of outlets was not enough for the number of bets. I arrived at the inn in the morning, so I wanted to have my luggage checked, but it's amazing! I was reluctant to look back at me and said, \"Come at 14:00!\" Actually, the day before, I fell down a mountain road and hurt my right rib, and I had severe pain in my left shoulder and arm due to neuralgia, and I was injured on both arms and shoulders, and I could not hold my backpack. I can't cough or get acne, I'm not satisfied with the toilet, and it takes about 5 minutes to wake up in bed. If you're at home, you're definitely going to see a doctor. I didn't give up even if I refused, and when I asked many times with my hands lowered, my head seemed to be very moody, but I received it. In the future, those who arrive early may be refused luggage storage, so I think it is necessary to be careful.","88":"It is a boutique hotel in a convenient but messy location, a 2-minute walk from both the Piazza del Duomo and the market. It is unknown what kind of person runs the business. The names of the rooms and the rooms are all related to the movie. During breakfast, you will be asked for your name, not your room number. The interior is unique and super modern. The electric buttons were too advanced and took some time to get used to. There was no bathtub. Also, the bed has a unique shape, which makes it a little difficult to sleep. There is a kitchenette, microwave oven, and IH stove for those who stay here, but there is no pot, so I was wondering how many people were using it. The breakfast place is on the top floor, but it is large enough to hold 10 people and the content is poor. It's nice to see Etna in the distance from the terrace. Due to security concerns, this hotel is self-locking because the area around the Duomo and the market is a little unsafe for travelers. Since there is only one person at the front desk, when no one is looking inside, you can open the front door by holding the room key. There is always only one at the front desk. The person will check in, guide you to the room and explain everything, so if you are unlucky you will be kept waiting in front of the front desk. I wish I had at least another staff member to guide me to the room. However, the location, the newness and cleanliness of the hotel make it a very good hotel for travelers who prioritize convenience.","89":"I made a reservation while looking at the reviews, but the interior was really strange. I don't think there will be any negative impact on my stay, but I was amazed anyway. Perhaps it was a difficult time to renovate an old building into a hotel. The ceiling is high, and it seems that he struggled to divide the private room into a good size. The high ceiling is made like the decoration of the palace, as in the Romano House. Breakfast was quite good. Can I stay overnight?","90":"The staff's response is good and comfortable. From the restaurant on the upper floor, you can see Mount Etna. There were many delicious restaurants around the hotel.","91":"It was a comfortable hotel. Reserve a larger room with bathtub. It is a 4 star hotel, but it is very disappointing that there are no slippers. From the station you can come by bus for 1 euro. The Etna roof breakfast was an extra 12 euros, but of course it was a good breakfast, but the original restaurant on the first floor was delicious enough and champagne was the best! It's probably champagne opened at the bar last night, but I'm happy that you can still get it free. When I made a hotel reservation from a certain famous site, it was said that dinner was 10% off, so I took dinner at Etna Roof and attached it to my room. It is said that it is invalid if you tell that you are not discounted at checkout. It's a pity that I paid for the room for what.","92":"When planning a trip to Paleomo, I opted for this hotel for the following reasons - price, location, price and positive reviews. In search of a hotel, I had to stray a little. In fact, from the airport you need to get to the city center, then walk along the central street of Victor Emmanuile to the Cathedral. Going around the cathedral on the left, you need to go straight for 300 meters and turn right. Santa Cristina street is at the back of the cathedral, the street is old and narrow, but it's easy to find it knowing the landmark)) The standard room was very spacious, with air conditioning, hairdryer, TV and minibar. The bed is comfortable, the linen is good. There is a sofa. The only strange thing is that the wash basin is in the room. A very helpful guy Viccenzo works at the reception, he quickly settled in, after a checkout he allowed to leave things at the hotel. He was also very kind on his part that he constantly treated us to coffee (not only for breakfast) and told us where to go in Palermo. In general, there was a feeling that I was visiting a friend)) for breakfast, cereals, croissants, delicious pies, fruits, yoghurts, freshly squeezed juice and tea (coffee) are served. In general, the hotel is above all praise, I recommend it to everyone. Both the service and the location are great))","93":"I liked everything) Good shower facilities, free beach umbrellas, good fresh and tasty breakfast. Wonderful pleasant hostess with good knowledge of English and a little French. Very clean, good bed and well located. Our room had a nice balcony. There are not many rooms, as I understand it, 3 or 4. The atmosphere is quiet and calm.","94":"close to the sea, excellent owners, free bicycles for rent. homemade breakfasts in the morning. huge clean bathroom. convenient bus connection to Agrigento. I think there is no better place in these parts","96":"Pros: 1-good location, 5 minutes from the Massimo theater and 15 from the center, in principle, everything can be reached on foot. The city is small 2 - pretty nice reception staff, especially Danielo. 3-to-3 stars breakfast is pretty good, however monotonous from day to day. Cons: 1-WiFi worked in certain parts of the room, it slowed down terribly 2- bathroom, it is impossible to take a shower, the curtain does not completely close and all the water ends up on the floor. 3-the air conditioner didn't work AND MOST IMPORTANT !!!!! Be careful!!!!! The cleaning ladies stole the passport with money inside, and blatantly lied that they had not seen the passport! However, I distinctly remember leaving him on the bed !!!! Lived from 28.06 to 2.07 In this regard, a sooooo negative impression, although at the reception they helped with the consulate. It would be better if the passport was returned, I agreed without money.","97":"Nice hotel located on a pedestrian street. It is convenient to get from the airport by public transport. Attractions, shops within walking distance. Stylish, bright, spacious room. Everything worked, cleaning every day. Friendly guys (owners) Simone and Ricardo. For breakfast, there are always fresh pastries and delicious coffee. The smell of flowering orange trees near the hotel will forever remain a wonderful memory of Sicily.","98":"The hotel is a 2-level apartment in a private house. It is located on the last, it seems, the 3rd floor. On the first level there is a small hall and 3 rooms, on the second level there is a dining room and 2 more rooms. The hotel is very conveniently located for both arrivals by train and by bus. And from the railway station and from the bus station 5-7 minutes on foot. First until p-le A. Moro, then take the first right onto via Atenea (semi-pedestrian street with shops and cafes) and up the stairs. Our room had a double bed, wardrobe, table, mini-fridge, armchair and chair, windows overlooked the courtyard, in the bathroom there was a shower, there was no hairdryer. The room rate included breakfast. For breakfast, tea \/ coffee \/ juice, croissants, buns, cookies, jam, honey, butter, fruits. Everything would be fine if not for the cold. There is no central heating, only air conditioning. He warmed up the room a little for 4 hours. If you stop here in the summer to explore the Valley of the Temples, then it is a very suitable place.","99":"In real life, we prefer minimalism. But we decided to take a chance and try something different. And they never regretted it. Excellent location. Near the central street, which is pleasant to walk in the evening. Nearby parking. One floor below is one of the best restaurants in town. And even lower, the most popular bar in the city. The room is cozy (there are only three of them in the hotel !!!). It should be noted that the Internet is fast enough, which is not always found in Italy. Good shower (this is important to me). Breakfast in the room according to the selected menu and at the specified time. The original idea of \u200b\u200broom design for B @ B.","100":"A very cozy hotel with spacious rooms and balconies overlooking the church. Located very close to the city center and the main street. An excellent choice of breakfast is served on the balcony. In the evening you can go down to the square in front of the hotel, where there is a wonderful and noisy wine restaurant.","101":"Wonderful hotel near the center of Agrigento. We stayed in a large spacious suite, the terrace offers a wonderful view of the Valley of the Temples ... at night the view is simply amazing! my companion asked the owner in advance for our arrival about the service - flowers, expensive champagne and sweets in the room, everything was performed in the best possible way! the service staff was even able to find exactly the champagne they asked for ... excellent service and good room service in the style of Louis IV, beautifully decorated, I liked the breakfast-large selection and everything is served in the room on the terrace, I honestly did not expect to be in agrigento in such a luxurious hotel :) real dolce vita)))","102":"Very nice R&B overlooking the strait. Excellent hospitality, comfortable and spotless rooms in a strategic position, excellent WiFi connection. If we really have to find a flaw, breakfast is not very abundant (it was completely lacking in salty) but still of quality.","103":"In the center of Trapani there is this beautiful structure finely furnished with design solutions; the very nice and spacious room also offers the possibility of a small equipped kitchenette. The abundant and rich breakfast is served on the top floor in a spectacular roof top overlooking the sea. The staff are very courteous.","104":"Together with my family, we spent one night in this room & breakfast ... The rooms are brand new equipped with all comforts, including kitchenette with coffee machine and kettle, comfortable mattresses, spacious and well organized bathroom. The breakfast room has a breathtaking view of the sea of \u200b\u200bthe strait. All very good: artisan cakes and pies, Yogurt, fresh fruit, jams, Nutella, barley, fresh croissants ... fully met our expectations. Even though it wasn't a pleasure visit for us, having a good night's sleep certainly improved our day. Special thanks to the owner for the wonderful welcome.","105":"With my girlfriend we decided to visit Messina and we stayed at the Garibaldi R&B. We are greeted by the kind Vittoria who makes us find the nice cool room with the air conditioning on. He explains everything to us and also gives us advice on where to eat. The room is spacious and clean and with a wonderful view. Good breakfast and wonderful view from the dining room (harbor view). The very kind Fabio gives us information on what to visit and where to eat (thank you very much for your valuable advice). Finally we are allowed to keep the room until 12 and 30 despite the check out was for 11 in order to allow us to see the astronomical clock where the statues move at 12.","106":"Structure located in the historic center of Trapani, with an extraordinary sea view that alone is worth the cost of the stay. After a quick check in we were assigned as expressly requested a studio with sea view, large, with adequate bathroom and very comfortable bed. Coffee maker included. Improved breakfast, especially in the salty and in the quality of fruit juices, but with some good cakes, served on a terrace with fantastic views. Polite, efficient and smiling staff. Price a tad bit high, which will not prevent us from returning soon","107":"I only stayed one night at this property and I don't think I fully appreciated its value. Nice place, a stone's throw from the center of Caltenisetta. Nice room, clean, very fine and elegant, well-kept garden, large parking area. Definitely to come back to fully enjoy the place and the structure.","108":"We stayed on the banks of the strait staying at this property with an excellent location and an enviable view, especially on summer days like the latter. Grade 10 to the welcome, professional staff, polite and always available at any time, grade 10 at the morning buffet where you can enjoy natural and fresh food and drinks, excellent orange juice, excellent Wi-Fi and excellent overall the spotless room , tastefully decorated. In short, what to say .... come to Messina and stay in welcoming and well-kept facilities like this one, I would recommend it to anyone.","109":"Ideal location for those who, like us, wanted to visit Palermo and enjoy it in all its beauty. This splendid beb is located in the historic center, in via Bari, 30 meters from Via Maqueda, 200 meters from the 4 Canti, a few steps from the Teatro Massimo ... In short, you have all the main attractions and not a stone's throw away. di schioppo ... Located on the first floor of a historic building, with lift. My husband booked a few months ago, as is his custom, as this b and b doesn't have many rooms so he wanted to be sure of the best accommodation. We stayed in this beautiful property for 7 days so I can give an objective evaluation. We had booked room 7, the suite, a delight. 44 square meters room with everything you need. And even something more. Very comfortable bed, very soft memory pillows, obsessive cleaning, Nespresso machine with excellent quality capsules available, kettle for herbal tea, which we did NOT use We are coffee lovers ... and that's it. Two LCD televisions, one in the bedroom and one in the sitting room, comfortable bathroom, huge shower with chromotherapy, optimal sleep quality, quiet room despite the central location. Breakfast to scream, nothing was missing, from pastries with chocolate and pistachios, cannoli, sardines to beccafico, toast, sweet and salty as if it were raining. Fruit juices, Yogurt .. Congratulations. Breakfast at the height of a 5-star hotel. I can state this without fear of denial. Professional, kind, friendly receptionists, without ever appearing intrusive. A heartfelt thanks to all the staff. The structure has a very efficient transfer service which we used to and from the airport as well as to go to Monreale and to some restaurants. Punctual and very kind. always. A heartfelt thanks to Mr. Foo. Recommended. Well done, we will return.","110":"Structure easy to find and immersed in the wonderful Sicilian countryside. Convenient and safe parking. Spacious, clean room with all the necessary comforts. Polite staff and hospitality in the best Sicilian traditions. Hearty and very good breakfast. Prices in the middle of the season and period. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for accommodation in the area.","111":"We needed one night for the last leg of our trip to southern Italy, before heading to Catania and the airport. We booked this B&B in booking. com arrived at 8:00 am after a long drive from the mainland. What could have been a tiring and confusing urban arrival on a busy night street was made easy enough by Favio, a host who did so much for us that it would have been difficult to do better. We had previously chatted on WhatsApp and it provided us with useful points of reference. (The signage for this place is a small plaque on an otherwise nondescript building - like many B & Bs.) I parked twice as my wife entered. (The road is wide enough to do this - and Italians do it a lot. Favio went out and took some of the luggage. Very friendly and very good English. We checked in quickly and efficiently. Favio offers paid parking ( 10 euros) in a nearby lot but we chose free overnight parking. Favio physically blocked a spot on the road for us near the accommodation while I maneuvered over it. (And he actually parked the car for me!) He offered advice on parking rates (starts at 8:30 am) and tourism. (The local historic center is a two block walk away. Spend an hour if you have it.) The room we chose (two they were left) facing the ocean but we should have taken the street room as it was bigger. The room decor was adequate for the task. There was also the rare electrical outlet expander! An extra place to plug. The bathroom was shiny and well tiled and super super clean. The sea view is of the harbor and during the night a huge cruise ship moored quite close to the balcony I could have hit a golf ball on it. Breakfast was the usual coffee and pastries, but there was also fresh fruit and hard boiled eggs. (Eggs aren't always offered in smaller Italian lodgings, not their thing.) Very sweet and helpful hostess. For Mom, there were a lot of open spaces and I got a little closer. We visited the old church and the historic district before leaving.","112":"We stayed 4 nights and I can't put one but it was all kindness on the part of Martina and the other person that I don't remember the name The room was very good and the breakfast was perfect We wanted to stay 2 more nights and as they had it full They looked for another place nearby, of course if I return to Palermo I will stay there again","113":"Beautiful B&B, very nice rooms, equipped bathroom. The perfect breakfast with a great variety and careful attention, even when we asked to do it after hours for an excursion they were very gracious. The unbeatable reception, both a young man and the two sisters who attend were always at our disposal. The location is great. Approved.","114":"Excellent place to choose in Messina. Unbeatable, central location, close to places of interest, restaurants and shops. The establishment is decorated with great taste, and attended with care and dedication. Comfortable beds and modern and equipped bathrooms. Very good breakfast !!!! I would return without hesitation","115":"Spacious, comfortable and clean rooms. Good breakfast. Beautiful Terrace Excellent staff, very friendly and attentive. Very well located. Close to everything there is to visit in the city. It was a convent from the year 1600. . Very well recycled. Would go back!","116":"It is a first class B&B. Run by its owners (father and son) the location is unbeatable. Breakfast is EXCELLENT. you walk everywhere, you can park on the same street. They explain how to pay per day and park anywhere in Messina with the same ticket. it really is very spacious, nice and clean !!! To recommend!","117":"We spent 3 nights in this hotel in Palermo, a couple of weeks ago, and the truth was that everything was perfect. The hotel is far from the center, but since it has parking (free), if you go by car, the distance does not matter. It has an immense garden that connects the rooms, and there you can breathe peace and tranquility (unlike the streets of Palermo). Our room was very large and bright, with a small balcony to the garden, and with beautiful views of the nearby mountains of Palermo. The bathroom was very new, and the room had a very modern lighting system, with the possibility of changing colors. The breakfast was very good, with very good attention, preparing the coffees or variants that we wanted, always with a smile. A hotel to recommend and return","118":"Good facilities, especially the renovated ones, comfortable and complete room. The service from both the reception and the dining room staff is correct. The very complete breakfast with sweets, fruits, salumes and cheeses. Recommended site especially outside the colder season.","119":"We have made the trip by car and we value hotels with easy access and that offer parking, as is the case here. With a ten minute walk you are in the center. Very large and comfortable room (we traveled 3). No cabinets (just a few shelf) but for one night it's not a problem. Very complete breakfast.","120":"Our visit was family, we were 12 people, My room was quadruple, which included my teenage children and my double bed. The location is very good to go out and explore the island by car. The location with respect to the center of the city is less than 1 km. The walk is very bearable. Very friendly staff and especially at the reception. Generous parking even in high season like we were. But the 10 !!! I'll bring it to him for breakfast. Very complete From eggs to goat cheese and ending with the typical Sicilian cannoli. Breakfast is served on the top floor overlooking the port of Palermo","121":"It is very well located in the center of Palermo. The rooms are fair enough. Breakfast could be improved. The hotel staff very attentive and pleasant. You have a free hotel car park to park your car during your stay at the hotel. And as a point to improve the hotel, apart from breakfast, if they put a pool it would be recommended because in summer time it is quite hot in Palermo.","122":"Excellent facilities in a spacious luxurious light, airy room right in the heart of Palermo. The modern, air-conditioned room is modern, fresh and excellent for a stay in the capital of Sicily, opposite a fantastic shop selling arancini.  The breakfast was plentiful & ample for starting a day of sightseeing. A great base to explore the hustle & bustle of this amazing city. The staff are attentive & extremely welcoming. I would definitely stay here on my next visit!","123":"This is a stunning place that is managed extremely well. The owner and the staff take very good care of their customers. Everything exceeds expectations: the whole set up is meticulously designed and decorated. It is spotlessly clean. The breakfast area is incredible and the morning spread is very good. The room exceeded our expectations and we regretted not staying more. It was spacious with a very comfortable bed and a sofa to relax. The bathroom area is also big with a very relaxing shower. We were able to drop our bags earlier than checkin allowed and leave them to explore the city more prior to our departure. Many places could learn from the level of customer service here!","124":"The booking was very uncomplicated and the communication with the hoteliers in advance was very good. We had also booked the airport transfer via the hotel, which also worked very well. Ok, it might have been a bit more expensive than by bus, but it was worth it, because we arrived quite late and were guided by the chauffeur directly into the B&B. The Delle Vittorie Luxury Rooms & Suites B&B is located in a side street of the Main Shopping Street right in the centre of the city of Palermo - so it's an ideal starting point for exploring the city. There are also many bars, restaurants and entertainment facilities in the area nearby. The room, which is divided into two by a room divider, was wonderfully large and very comfortably furnished. Also the bed was very comfortable and the room could be darkened well. But our absolute highlight was the disco-shower that was a lot of fun, not only after a heavy pub crash. :-) The breakfast was very good, too, always lovingly arranged and quite sufficient, although not very varied. Our special thanks go to Federica for the given tips for eating out, for excursions and other activities to do in Palermo. We can fully recommend the Delle Vittorie Luxury Rooms & Suites and would like to come back again, thank you!","125":"Coming from overseas, they video messaged us to help us find our way and saved us a parking spot on the street in front! The room was great, and the location is good for walking about with restaurants, shops and sights nearby. Breakfast had good variety and fresh orange juice.","126":"Very comfortable sparkling clean rooms with good showers. Awesome views of the Mediterranean to enjoy the Sunrise and Sunset. Breakfast was spectacular with very attentive friendly staff. The front desk staff was very helpful with guiding us with must see things in the short amount of time we had. Restaurants, bakeries and shopping area is close walking distance. Parking is bit of a challenge.","127":"We had a really nice stay at the B&B. The breakfast was very good. And the room was clean and comfortable. We had a warm welcome at the reception. And there was even a parking spot arranged for us. It's located in the middle of the city centre.","128":"The hotel is in an excellent location to walk around the centre of the city. The rooms are of a high standard, the staff extremely friendly and helpful and the roof top bar cafe for breakfast and evening drinks is awesome. There is also a roof top area to sun bath, magic. Cannot praise staff enough for their help. Definitely would stay here again.","129":"We stayed here for a few days in October, nice room, good breakfasts and excellent location. The staff are friendly and very helpful. Each evening you can visit the top floor breakfast room which turns into a bar where you can watch the sun going down and have a drink before dinner at one of the many restaurants in Trapani. With your drink the hotel provides a finger buffet of Sicilian specialties. Very nice.","130":"This was the first hotel of our trip and our only splurge as we wanted comfort and convenience to start us off. That being said, they earned a perfect rating. Check-in was easy and our room was incredible (307). It had an open floor plan with two rooms (bedroom and dining). The bathroom was large and very nice. You had to squint and look hard to find the aging or the uncared for parts. There were three windows, one facing the sea and old fish market square below, one facing the road we chose to park on (Lungomare Dante Alighieri), and the other facing the road that approaches the square (via Torrearsa). There was also a window in the bathroom. They all kept the street noise at a minimum. We didn\u2019t cook but it had a kitchenette. Two bottles of water per day for free in the mini-fridge (you can\u2019t drink the tap water). Solid wood floors. Hand painted tiles on the ceiling. Great WiFi. Breakfast was plentiful and lovely with the view of the sea and friendly service. The solarium was nice and open with showers. There was a gym we didn\u2019t use, of course. And despite advertising that no one is there beyond 8pm there was always someone there when we got back from dinner. Good recommendations, easy to follow directions, and they changed bills for coins for parking without a problem. Thank you!","131":"We stayed for two nights in one of the suites at the end of our holiday round Sicily. The location is perfect - in the middle of the city, close to all the sights and many restaurants. We easily walked from the bus station with our bags, and when we left we booked their excellent transfer service (with a lovely female driver who also talked to us about Sicily). Our room was superb, large and spacious to a very high standard, just like the photos. There were many nice gestures, like the welcome bottle of red wine, and our being able to enjoy panini and other items remaining from breakfast. Breakfasts were fresh, with lots of variety - cereals, pastries, yoghurts, boiled eggs, fresh fruit, panini etc, and we enjoyed the coffee made to order. Francesca, the co owner was terrific and so helpful throughout our stay. We would definitely stay here again.","132":"The accommodation offers beautifully furnished, comfortable, well-kept and clean rooms in a prime central location directly on via Maqueda. A space in the parking garage will be organized a few meters further if you reserve in advance, as will the registration for driving into the city center. The breakfast is rich and very nicely arranged. Wine and snacks are available free of charge all day. Martina and Federica are very personable, warm and always in a good mood, trying hard and brimming with tips for a pleasant stay. Thank you very much for your hospitality!","133":"Villa Russo was an absolutely positive surprise for us, which will now forever be one of our most beautiful holiday memories. We were immediately warmly welcomed by the hosts Claudia and Michele and shown through the localities. The property definitely deserves its name Villa. Everything looks much better than on the pictures, everything is absolutely new and built and furnished with a lot of love. The rooms are furnished with so much care that you feel at home. We have never felt so at home in any other accommodation. The cleanliness surpasses a 5-star hotel and we have never seen it in this form before. As soon as you step in, you get a smell of cleanliness. Bed linen and towels in particular smelled very good and fresh. Cleaning is done every day and bed linen and towels are changed again on the third day at the latest. The bathroom with the shower was shining and the equipment was above average with e.g. walk-in shower. The rooms are all air-conditioned and there is a refrigerator available. This is a blessing, especially in summer. The WiFi worked great on the whole area. Fast and without interruptions. How it should be. There was also a lounge (which was more like a luxurious living room) at your disposal. This offered a large TV (every room also had one), a cozy couch and a large dining table. There were also enough parking spaces. These were free, which is very commendable. The absolute highlight of the property, however, are the hosts. These live nearby and can be found almost everywhere. We immediately fell in love with Claudia and Michele. Not only do they fulfill every wish, they read our wishes from our eyes. They gave us lots of tips for leisure activities and restaurants where they sometimes go out to eat themselves. And the places and restaurants were really great. They supported us in every situation and made our vacation something very special. Nowhere have we ever felt better cared for. You also noticed that at breakfast. Both in terms of time and the selection of breakfast options, you have directed yourself towards us. We have never seen that before either. The breakfast was very rich, varied and fresh. We were allowed to take this on the terrace, which offers a great view of the surroundings. In good weather you can even see the Etna. The view is breathtaking. Depending on the season, you can also get home-grown products. For example figs from your own fig trees. You can practically pick them yourself if you want to. We were also lucky enough to be able to try something of Claudia's culinary arts. We will never forget your homemade almond milk. If you are looking for a quiet and well-kept place to relax, or if you want to explore the surroundings of Caltanissetta, there is no better place than Villa Russo. Thanks to the hosts, you don't have to worry about anything during your stay and you feel completely at ease. Villa Russo should be seen once. For us it is certain that we will be back. Thank you Russo family !!!!","134":"Great hotel in a beautifully renovated palazzo with a wonderful view of the sea. Very clean, good beds, very friendly staff. Breakfast on the roof terrace is a dream! Alla great!","135":"Great location in the center, beautiful roof terrace with a view of the sea, very friendly staff who gave us a map and tips for dinner, assistance in finding a parking space, great breakfast buffet, excellent value for money, elevator available, WiFi","136":"As in many other places in Sicily, we are greeted by a very friendly employee. Given the national holiday, we don't need the parking space that was actually reserved. Otherwise, this is definitely recommended, as the Garibaldi is located directly on one of Messina's main traffic arteries. From the breakfast room you can see the port and Calabria. Due to the traffic already mentioned, it is relatively noisy even with the windows closed. But the air conditioning works without any problems. The central location in Messina is very nice. It is only two minutes to the cathedral and the nightlife district, while the main shopping street is around 10 minutes on foot.","137":"We stayed at this hotel for a week and were very satisfied. Nice modern room and generally a nice complex with a good location, as there are very good bus connections to both the center and the beach, which is also not expensive. The hotel has a great breakfast with a lot of choice, friendly staff and a bar where you can hang out in the evening.","138":"Very good price-performance ratio, the location is ideal if you are traveling by car. Parking space is available. Rooms are clean and functional. The entire staff is very friendly and accommodating, the breakfast buffet is very varied.","139":"I stayed at this hotel with a group. It looks very modern on the photos, but my room (5th floor) was anything but modern. My room faced the back yard and it was very noisy. Sleep was out of the question for the entire week. Furthermore, one of my doors had already split off wood in the outside area, as if someone had tried to break in. And the door couldn't really be locked from the inside. The breakfast is very extensive, but hardly contains anything lactose-free, let alone vegan, if you belong to this group (I am lactose intolerant myself). The breakfast room is located on the 7th floor, opens at 7 a.m. and offers a view of the harbor and the cruise ships in it. The elevators work fine, but are a little slow. The staff speaks English, partly also French and Spanish. The hotel is particularly popular with tour groups, at least there were numerous tour groups present during my stay. The closets smelled a bit strange. If you follow Google Maps, it will take you around 15-20 minutes to walk to town. If you check out and then want to leave your luggage behind, it is simply placed behind the counter. So not really secured. You can wash, dry and iron your laundry yourself there, but I did not use this service. And of course it is only possible for an extra charge","140":"The hotel is very well maintained, the service staff is very friendly and the kitchen is amazing. The restaurant in the inner courtyard is an oasis in the bustling city. In addition to breakfast, they also offer dinner - definitely go! Our room was impressively large and modern. Nobody needs a treatise here about shower joints in Italy. ;-)\r The location in the old town is very central and you can explore Palermo on foot from there. When we were guests in September, night was turned into day on the square in front of the hotel - unfortunately, sleeping was out of the question.","141":"The hotel is very central. It has a nice swimming pool. The rooms in the new building are on the small side, but the bathroom is nice. The breakfast buffet is okay. The friendliness of the staff could be better.","142":"Very warm welcome in a family atmosphere. The owners are lovely and do everything to make you feel welcome. We didn't speak Italian but were able to communicate. The room was spacious, comfortable and extremely clean. The breakfast was simple but the value for money of the accommodation is excellent. Quiet location and possibility of parking the car in front of the accommodation. Excellent starting point for visiting Agrigento. Extreme kindness of the owners.","143":"The room is clean and spacious, the welcome is professional (with a few words in French, which is appreciable in Sicily), the Americano-cocktail very well served at the bar, the breakfast is generous. To recommend","144":"This mixed business and tourist hotel is located on the outskirts of Palermo, not far from the center, but you still have to get around and find parking in the city, which is a challenge. We are also very quickly in Mondello. We went for our walks in the city in the morning and in the afternoon direct to Mondello to enjoy the beach and eat quiet by the water before returning. To know there is a restaurant which is attached to the hotel which shares a beautiful decoration and which makes very good pizzas with impeccable service. The medium sized rooms were very clean and modern, the bathroom operational and the breakfast plentiful. in the garden a bar is open in the evening, very pleasant. The value for money is unbeatable.","145":"a very good bed and breakfast right in the center of town; the price is very low, the boss can even offer you a closed garage for the car very good address, right in the center of this city which, off the beaten track, is worth a detour","146":"We spent three nights on a self-drive tour in Sicily in September. Very good reception, the hotel corresponds very well to the photos. The hostesses are adorable and full of good advice. We had a large, clean and quiet room, with an extra room to sleep a child. The environment is very clean and wooded. It looks nice. The parking lot in front is bound to be crowded but there is a street in front where we had space for the entire stay. The breakfast is very good, served in the basement until 10:30 am which was very good for us. The small downside is its distance from the city center on one side and the beach on the other. We thought he was more or less in the middle, so perfect, but on foot, it's still quite far away. The car in Palermo is complicated. For everything else, it's really great. We recommend.","147":"Perfect rooms parking to put your car. Friendly staff and not very far from the city center (count 300 meters walk). Hearty breakfast, the bar is however a bit sparse despite the warm welcome from the barman","148":"We were very well received.The setting is nice, the room is spacious, clean and the bedding perfect, a big point for the breakfast which is more than complete with a terrace which gives a beautiful view of the port, very kind staff and helpful, very good value for money. Room 205","149":"If you arrive early enough, you will have the chance to take advantage of a free parking space. Very warm welcome with a voucher for a welcome drink: unfortunately, there is no bar to enjoy it! Room corresponding to Ibis standards, which is reassuring compared to random B & Bs). Strong point: the breakfast room with panoramic view over Palermo.","150":"Very nice establishment, with fairly recent equipment, well designed and neat design. The dinners and breakfasts we ate at the hotel were very good, in terms of both quality and quantity. Attentive and available staff (although sometimes lacking a little warmth). The hotel's location places it close to most of the monuments and areas of the old town of Palermo. However, Palermo is so made that its old city includes deprived settlements, even ruined islets (not reconstructed after the bombings of the last war). The street population also reflects this poverty, and can sometimes give a worrying image of itself. However, in fact, during this 4 night stay, we encountered absolutely no security problems, or even been bothered, including in the evening.","151":"Apart from the rooms, correct and modern (but already deteriorated), very little positive about this hotel ... Elevator broken the whole stay (which left only one elevator in working order for a very large hotel, imagine the delays waiting times ...), very noisy neighborhood, holiday club atmosphere (lower category), breakfast room and panoramic bar not very pleasant and with a canteen atmosphere + constant noise of ships and very strong smell of fuel), breakfast of poor quality, noise and lack of correctness from customers, disappointing service (staff at the breakfast bar not very helpful and unfriendly) ... very quick and impersonal check-out, including for Accor card holders ... in short, we will not be going back!","152":"The hotel has a really good location, a very fair price, it is definitely clean and modern, very quiet, friendly and helpful staff, fast and stable internet, fine Italian breakfast and parking garage close by.","153":"Nice and clean, friendly staff. Real value for money. We stayed one night but managed to eat buffet w. Drinks for 20 \u20ac per. nose. Lots of vegetables, some meat but ok. Breakfast is included, richly selected from hot and cold A walk down to the local ice cream parlor by the small harbor, can be recommended","154":"After a bit of searching in San Leone, we found the hotel. Got a room on the second floor (218), with nice views to the hotel pool, the sea and the city of Agrigento on the other side of the bay. Nice! The room was large enough for the 2nd bathroom with bath and shower. For the room there was a nice size terrace with tiles and chairs. Air conditioning worked as it should and the small fridge was fine too. Throughout our stay we had problems with the key to the room. The key was a magnet card and it often had to be reset at the front desk. There was WiFi in the hotel. It seemed ok in the room (tv streaming possible) but by the pool the speed was somewhat reduced. Breakfast was served from a Pavillion by the pool. We thought the food was good and varied. There was nothing missing, although the Italian cold cuts are more watery and have less flavor than the Danish. By the pool there was the opportunity to buy lunch and drinks all day. The food was of excellent quality. The whole hotel area is nicely planted and generally looks good and clean. This is in stark contrast to the city of San Leone. At the reception you can contact in English and get a reasonable answer back: grinning :. The cleaning in the room is okay, friendly cleaning staff. Parking at the hotel takes place on the hotel's own area with shade canopy. The grade average is fully deserved. The reason it is not given higher is due to the four stars the hotel is equipped with. It raises the standard for the high grades.","155":"I stayed a couple of nights at this hotel, which was booked by our tour operator, Klassikernes Rejseforening. The building is beautiful and practically rebuilt from its previous function as a stock exchange or bank; one can still see the huge iron doors to the safe deposit boxes near the dining room. My room was on the top floor and a little hard to find from the elevator the first time due to the fact that the building was not designed as a hotel, but the room was superb and beautifully decorated in classic Italian style. The breakfast was excellent and with rich selection. I did not eat other meals at the hotel, but enjoyed several days in the late afternoon a glass of Sicilian wine in the open courtyard and was fully satisfied with the friendly waiter.","156":"I stayed at the Colleverde Park Hotel during a tour of Sicily with the Classic Travel Association, so we were taken to the hotel by the tour bus. The rooms are excellent, well maintained and neat and clean, but beyond that nothing special to write about. The staff was helpful. The breakfast buffet was excellent and rich. I also ate for dinner at the hotel and was quite happy with the selection and serving, but - as with the rooms - the dinner was not a special experience. Instead, it was the garden that is filled with exotic plants, and from which one has a beautiful view down to the temples and the garden.","157":"Really nice place, with really nice views. Located on the 12th floor, but there is an elevator. Very sweet hosts who made us feel very welcome. Tasteful decor and breakfast served on the large roof terrace overlooking the Valley of the Temples and the sea.","158":"Perfect location. Francesco took the time to introduce his B&B, the history of his own family, gave good advice about Agrigento and the surrounding area. Really high class: thumbsup: ???? Really cozy roof terrace for breakfast and evening fun: wink:","159":"A nice \"old\" hotel. It's all workouts for an upgrade modernization. But everyone is incredibly friendly sweet and there is nothing missing. A small nice breakfast buffet with what you need. The pool is large and good if you have children with you. The location drags down a lot. But is otherwise close to several visitor numbers.","160":"We had 4 nights at Antica Perla in connection with a tour of Sicily in September 2018. Antica Perla is located on the coast of Agrigento. That said, there is far to everything except the beach. There is no restaurant at Antica Perla, on the other hand there is a small kitchenette, it was also used as there is 2km to the nearest restaurant. There is a nice pool and a very nice beach. Walk 300 meters west of the hotel and there is 1000 meters of fine sandy beach. Breakfast is included, we are far from everything, but it is nothing to write about. In return, there are maps to Temple Valley and the Stair of the Turks. Also visit the ex Caserma della Guardia di Finanza, which can be seen from the hotel. Best rooms are probably 404 or 405 as they have balcony directly facing the sea. There is free parking right by the hotel. Antica Perla is a fine aparthotel, both for excursions and relaxation","161":"This is not the hotel if you want to stay close to restaurants and shops. It is also not the hotel for people with overly delicate noses, as a few times during our stay there was a bad smell down from the sea just below the hotel. But if one can live with the above it is a a little gem of a hotel. There is only a 5 minute walk to a good and not smelly sandy beach, which during our stay was much used by local residents. The hotel has a nice pool with plenty of space on the sun loungers. There is a bar where you can buy coffee, ice cream and cold drinks from morning until late evening. The breakfast buffet was satisfactory and we had a spacious apartment with two balconies, both with sea views. Only minus was that there was a lack of kitchen equipment to be able to cook hot food, but it was fine to have lunch with cold cuts and Italian delicacies. Within 5 km there are several large supermarkets and restaurants. 10-15 km away are partly the Valley of the Temples and the Turkish Stairs (limestone cliff), which were the reasons why we visited this corner of lovely Sicily. At the beginning of July we gave 870 euros for five nights to a family of four and we thought we got a lot for our money.","162":"We stayed in a spacious room of 40sqm at least with individual wc, comfortable and clean in the historic center of Palermo, very close to almost all historical sites and monuments, on foot in 10-15 minutes most covered as well as a visit for walks on the beach. Of course and with direct access to public transport. With 3,50 \u20ac with two transports you arrived in Monreale ... 15km outside the city. The wi fi is perfect. The breakfast is amazing and varied. The staff is impeccable. We visit you again soon .... thanks: pray:","163":"In a very good area 17 minutes walk from the sights, clean without carpet only wood on the floor. Comfortable bed spacious room No 906 for IBIS Very good breakfast, helpful staff, easy and safe parking both on the street and indoors. Restaurants nearby area .I will visit it again.","164":"Central hotel, quiet, decent rooms and facilities, nice breakfast, good dinner. Satisfactory wifi and free in all areas. Helpful staff and willing. They all spoke very good English.","165":"is in a very central location. all furniture is white and minimal. It has air conditioning. It is located on the second floor of a building. It does not have breakfast inside the building but you get a coupon for the next cafe. It has no keys but a code.","166":"It was the best accommodation we stayed in Sicily. In the most beautiful square of Agrigento, next to the City Hall and the church of San Domenico, this romantic hotel far exceeded our expectations. The interior of the hotel with the imposing marble staircase was very impressive and meticulous down to the smallest detail. A very kind young man led us to our room and offered us a treat with typical Sicilian sweets -cannoli, pies- and juices. He also gave us a local guide and restaurant recommendations. The room ..... was unique! We felt that we were hosted in a palace! The patina of time made it so charming and, in addition, it was functional and with a separate space for our things. The breakfast was perfect: homemade sweets that excited us - I also asked for the recipes - pies, juices and impeccable service. I would like to insist mainly on the part of the warmth of the staff: I have never seen so kind and at the same time direct and warm staff! They caught the conversation with every company, covered every need that could arise and made us feel like their guests not like tourists who came and will leave. The only \"bad\" thing is that they raised the bar too high! We will miss ...","167":"The hotel is really worth the 4 * .It is located in a great location near the marina of Palermo as well as in the historic city center, ideal for walking.The hotel is very clean, modern and quiet.The staff is also very helpful and friendly.The room It was modern, comfortable and with a very good temperature. Breakfast is very rich and delicious (rare for Italy) with amazing cakes and tarts served upstairs overlooking the terraces and the color of the old historic city. There is nothing negative, Maybe just the fact that it does not have parking. With a little luck and effort, however, there is a possibility of parking near the hotel. Also, as a suggestion, it is good to equip the room with a pair of slippers.","168":"The hotel is very close to the temples. If it is full moon the valley of the temples closes at 11pm and the view from the garden is magical. Breakfast, room, staff and restaurant are great for its class. Free parking on site hotel","169":"We stayed three people for two days. The accommodation is renovated, clean very close to the historic center of the city. We were very happy with our stay there. We were 3 people and we went at night. We chose it among many others that we did not like. The owner explained everything to us and we even left the rented car in free parking. We noted what we wanted for breakfast which was brought to us at the time we requested. I highly recommend it. Thanks for staying. the only downside is the lack of an elevator","170":"Choose it, because it is located in the center of the city, very close to restaurants, shops and attractions. Also because it has large rooms, very nicely decorated and very clean. It has a very good breakfast that you can have either on the terrace or in the dining room . The owners are very helpful and make you feel at home. the only negative is no elevator!","171":"One of the worst hotels I have stayed in and I have stayed in many. Location: DOUBLE !!!!!! at the airport . At every takeoff the whole hotel trembled. NEXT to a gas station. The entrance on our arrival was full of papers and garbage. It remained the same after our departure. The toilet smelled like a cigarette. An elevator was on the floor - it ruined the day of our departure. Breakfast of a Greek hotel in the province of the fourth category. The positives: Spacious room, good beds, good dinner","172":"The entrance from the restaurant to the room is very close to Quattro Canti. Breakfast is delicious. I stayed in the suite for two nights, but it was very spacious and comfortable, and I regretted that I should have scheduled another night. The cost performance was the best, and we also arranged a taxi to the airport for a fixed amount. To get there, use the airport bus and get off at the stop just in front of Central Station. It was a very convenient hotel because it was close to the restaurants I wanted to visit, and if I walked in a pedestrian street, I could reach the Massimo Theater immediately. You'll be immersed in the satisfaction of a hotel that everyone knows, and you will definitely use it next time.","173":"From Palermo Central Station, walk through the square in front of the station and walk about 700m along Roma street to reach the hotel. I stayed for 2 nights in a room with a balcony on the top floor. When I came out to the balcony of my room, I could see Roma street and the mountain range in the suburbs of Palermo. The view from the breakfast hall was even more wonderful, and I was able to spend an elegant breakfast time. The food was also satisfying. Also, at night, the breakfast venue and the terrace above it became a bar where you could enjoy wine while watching the beautiful night view. Just like the station, tourist attractions were within walking distance, and it was about 500 meters to Quattro Canti. On Sunday morning, I walked to Teatro Massimo while looking at the beautiful streets of Maqueda street for pedestrians only. I was able to arrive in about 30 minutes from the hotel. I think the location of the hotel is good and it is a good hotel with a wonderful view of the breakfast venue.","174":"After arriving at Messina around 800 at night, make a reservation from the reservation site. When I arrived at the hotel, the staff member was returning home, but when I got in touch with the hotel via the intercom at the entrance and told the reservation status, he opened the door. Follow the instructions and find the card key in the common entrance to the room. Although there is no reception service, I was able to enter smoothly into a well-cleaned large room. Although the washroom is small, the large double room with two large windows has a small kitchen, a large table (combined desk) and a sofa, making it comfortable for a long stay. Enough to go out in the morning at night. The view to the harbor is open and open, the location is not in the middle, and although it is not luxurious, Cospa is the oldest. The staff was kind and the breakfast was very good. There was a free parking space for about two cars on the front street.","175":"When I first walked from the bus stop, it felt a little far, but it was convenient because the tram station was nearby. Each room had its own theme and my room was emerald. I'm happy because I love green. He cleans up every day and exchanges B&B towels every other day, but he exchanged them everyday. There was a refrigerator so I could drink as much water as I wanted at any time, and I was told that I could eat something in the breakfast space 24 hours a day. Breakfast was delicious. Do you eat an omelet first? Asks me, \"Tutto ok?\" Cappuccino is delicious with cocoa powder. The staff was always moving quickly and I felt very good. I definitely want to stay again! There was a fairly decent cafe nearby, so that was one of my pleasures. What time do you arrive I will be asked before lodging. But even when I arrived at that time, it was still unmanned, so I was a little worried. (It was about 15 minutes, so it was acceptable)","176":"Although the flight from Naples was delayed and the check-in started at around 23:00, from the bus stop (the port near the sea is an alternative bus stop due to the large-scale redevelopment around the Politeama Theater) to the hotel There were no factors that made two people feel uneasy. The hotel staff was also very efficient and I was able to enter the room immediately. The rooms of the Mercure series have the impression that they are spacious, but this is no exception, and both the room and the balcony were spacious. From everyone's reviews, I didn't expect much for breakfast, but it's just like a Japanese business hotel. However, the breakfast hall was very crowded because it was New Year. You'll never get lost, because Via Roma is just around the corner and there's a small church at the corner to the hotel. However, as a person accompanied by a mother in her 70s, I wonder if the center of sightseeing was far away. There are many stylish and delicious restaurants in the surrounding area, and I am very satisfied with the price.","177":"I used it for the second time. Breakfast is delicious at a very low price, and the staff at the reception and other staff are kind and satisfying. This time, I changed the schedule suddenly, but I heard it right away. It's a very old structure and you can't enter it without pressing the bell. However, since there is a location near the station, I think that it is better to have this kind of security, and I think that it is possible to taste the old built atmosphere, although the elevator, bed, furniture, bathroom etc are old. Also, there is a pay parking lot on the side and will tell you, but this time we arrived late at night, so we could stop in front of the hotel until early morning. And the next day, I was happy to receive a paper for parking that can be stopped anywhere in Palermo for one day. There are a lot of places to eat in the side streets of the neighborhood, but there are many, so I think it would be good to check it out using Google or this TripAdvisor. The roads in the neighborhood are a little dark and seemingly scary, but when I went inside, there were many tourists and it was so lively that I didn't think it was safe. This time, I am very happy to find a nice restaurant within walking distance. But I couldn't find the remote control for the air conditioner. Maybe they can't adjust themselves...","178":"30 minutes walk to Politeama Theater in the new town. There was a supermarket and delicious chicken restaurant near by. The room is large with hair dryer, soap and shampoo for both body and hair. Breakfast has a variety of kinds, and it is a whole cake similar to a Western confectionery store!","179":"I stayed on a tour. The food was also delicious. There was a pool in front of the restaurant, over there was the Mediterranean Sea, and I saw the sun setting. Is beautiful. There was also a bathtub.","180":"The location is convenient in front of the Massimo Theater. It is a fairly stylish hotel and the staff is very kind. The jacuzzi bath, which is too wide, is nice for Japanese people. What is different from a typical hotel is that at first glance you do not know where the entrance is, and you are given the keys of the building entrance, elevator, hotel entrance, and room four-piece set to go in and out by yourself. No staff available after check-in, check-out and cleaning of only 4 rooms. The style of calling for urgent business. The staff will come in at 7am and prepare breakfast for us, so it's 8am. That's why check-in was possible at 10 o'clock, and it's easy to say that it is a luxury private lodging. The care was taken care of by me.","181":"I think rental cars are the best for families with children in the summer. The host is very kind. Even if I returned from the Agrigento archeological site Night Open at midnight, he kindly opened the parking lot. You can walk to the beach. There is a balcony so you can dry your clothes. The room is clean and the air conditioner is perfect.","182":"We chose this location to stay for half a week on our first trip to Sicily. We were warmly welcomed by Silvia and Bruno and received all the necessary explanations, you can always contact them for additional tourist tips. There was a sofa bed in the living room where the elder of 11 slept. The master bedroom had a double bed and a single bed in which the youngest of 9 slept. Everything was neatly maintained. The bathroom was sometimes a bit too fresh for us, then you can see that it is usually warm in Sicily. We were therefore not able to use the pool, but it was also well maintained and provided with plenty of sun loungers. The kids could play ping-pong by the pool. We also had a very nice dinner at Silvia one evening with only fresh products, highly recommended for lovers of Italian cuisine! As the other reviews quote, the view is 360 \u00b0 UNIQUE. Thanks Silvia, Bruno & Ipad!","183":"authentic building with rooftop and beautiful view, excellent breakfast, luggage storage possible, nice location in the center staff can laugh a bit more, noisy for noise from the street (viaRoma), rooms could use a small update, hard beds Slightly too expensive for what is offered","184":"Very well located to visit Palermo old town. Nice room, very neat. Very friendly and helpful staff. Beautiful rooftop bar where breakfast continues in the morning and you can eat well in the evening away from the city bustle.","185":"The location of the hotel is unique. Directly on the sea, with a beautiful view of the hinterland. The staff is very correct and friendly and all questions and wishes during our stay were answered immediately. The rooms are large but need an update after 8 years. Many details need to be renewed or supplemented. Bicycles are available free of charge on this very large site, which also has 2 x 18 and 1 x 9 hole golf course. Small beach, but you can swim in 2 large pools. The wellness area is well maintained. The guests are mostly golfers, especially Italians and a small group of Germans with the occasional 'lost' Dutchman. Golfers have 2 courses available which are identical in layout. The last 3-4 holes of both courses are right on the sea. Very beautiful at sunset. Separate green fee costs \u20ac 130 !! The prices can be judged negatively. In my opinion unacceptable. Dinner and lunch are from another planet. Price quality ratio is very hard to find. No one visits the restaurant for a second time. Everyone flees to the town of Sciacca, which is about 17 km away. (great alternative: Hostaria de Vicolo) The drinks are also disproportionate. This is not a relaxed holiday feeling, unless you can pay \u20ac 4 for a cup of hot water and a bag of tea and \u20ac 10 for a glass of house wine. An example of a few basic dishes; plate of simple spaghetti costs \u20ac 22.00. A schnitzel with a few beans and a few fries will cost you \u20ac 28. The quality of that was also questionable. I even think this is a fraud. Then I am not talking about 'haute cuisine' dishes. We enjoyed the service, hotel location and spa, but we had to get in the car every day to eat well and pay. In the summer there are many 'anarchist' children who cause problems with their bicycles. Never again.","186":"beautiful, charmingly decorated rooms. The breakfast was delicious with homemade fruit salads, jams and pastries. According to the description, there would be parking at the site, but this is the public road, which is overcrowded at night due to the nearby restaurants and bars!","187":"Room and bathroom are clean and just spacious enough. Wifi is ok. all over the hotel. Breakfast is not very extensive but tasty. You can request additional items such as scrambled eggs, espresso, cappucino, ... Friendly and helpful staff.","188":"Very centrally located on piazza Massimo, a nice small comfortable hotel. Extremely friendly and helpful staff. In the morning a delicious simple breakfast in the room, or in the living room. Despite room on the square, not too noisy with doors closed and good air conditioning. Well surrounded by a restaurant, shops and sights. For us a great hotel, not overly luxurious but neat, fresh rooms that are well cleaned and exude a beautiful atmosphere. We will come back here for sure.","189":"We thought it was not really worthy of 4-star, a good three would be better. Room was decent sized, clean and sound proof (we had square theater view room). Bathroom was small with a tight shower, there was an unpleasant smell which unfortunately we could not get away. Breakfast is limited, you can choose to use it in your room or in your living room. Mind you, you have to climb a steeper staircase to get to the hotel, so you must be able to walk. Waiters were friendly and helpful.","190":"First of all, make it clear: this is a very good B&B. When you enter Enna after a steep climb, you will find B&B Enna Inn Centro in one of the first houses. It seems very busy, and the front door does not immediately give you a 'waaw feeling'. When you are ushered in, you must quickly reconsider your opinion. There is no sign of the hustle and bustle in the street, it is quiet, the house is very stylishly decorated, painted and furnished. All rooms have a magnificent view of the surroundings (there is no house between the B&B and the valley) and of Calascibetta in particular. There is also a large roof terrace! Our room was very clean, freshly colored, the bathroom was fine, equipped with every comfort. The breakfast room, cleverly decorated, is a very nice place. The young hostess and friend barista\u2026 who makes wonderful cappuccinos for breakfast, run the B&B with infectious enthusiasm. The breakfast was also very tasty and varied. We arrived in Enna during Holy Week, the week before Easter, and had no idea that this was one of the highlights of the year for Enna (every day parades of religious confraternit\u00e0) culminating on Good Friday. The hostess gave us all conceivable information (what, where, when) that we gratefully used. The location of the B&B is very favorable, centrally between the two parts of the city, with the furthest point of the city (the Castello, from where you have a beautiful view of Mount Etna) a fifteen minute walk away. There are many good restaurants in the turn, we were very pleased with the restaurant Baglio Balata, about 100m from the B&B (a tip we got; an original restaurant where you can enjoy a pizza or a typical Sicilian dish). Parking is also no problem, you can easily lose the car in the area.","191":"We arrived at the hotel through an organized trip to Sicily. Not self-selected. The hotel is still young (about 10 years old) but looks much older. Room size was good, but very basically furnished. TV only had Italian channels, AC did not work. The bed was good size and a reasonable mattress. Nice large balcony, but through low walls you can see the balconies of all neighbors. 2 plastic chairs on the balcony are not very inviting to sit on. Shower was very good but no shelf at the sink to put your things on. Breakfast mediocre. Lots of cake and other sweets, for sandwich fillings only cheese, ham and salami. The restaurant is truly past glory. The stucco is coming off the walls and the floor is dirty. Dinner (buffet only) had many tasty snacks, but not one piece of meat. Most guests had all inclusive (which usually doesn't make up for the quality). The hotel is quite remote, you really need a car to get around. The hotel's private beach is not much, and very narrow strip under a busy road. The hotel is sufficient for the price we paid, but it is not a hotel that we would have selected ourselves.","192":"The hotel met our expectations. Very good food and wine included in the price of half board. The town is very small but with a nice beach one AK from the hotel. The hotel beach is ugly, but it is enough to walk 2km to have a nice and empty beach. The main downside was the pool opening hours.","193":"Nice clean hotel. Pool also clean, large with enough sunbeds to find a spot at any time of the day. The rooms are clean, cleaned daily. You can find a few details that could undergo a facelift, but they did not interfere with our rest at all. Tasty and varied meals - especially dinners. There were usually a few hot dishes to choose from (e.g. rissotto and pasta with vegetables or meat), soup, fish or meat, potatoes, lots of cold snacks, baked vegetables, lettuce) - seafood dishes appeared twice during a week's stay! (to my disappointment;)) Local spaces are also served. Drinks with dinner in the HB option plus unlimited. Both alcohol and without. Personally, I recommend red wine in decanters - white from a pourer or from a tiler, not - i.e. I did not like it :) The hotel beach is close and actually not very attractive (by the street, rocky, narrow and with concrete breakwaters), but with full beach service and views despite that beautiful. The beaches on the other side of the peninsula are definitely more attractive. Especially if we go left from the hotel near the lake and then right towards the beach :) I recommend this hotel for people who like to relax by the pool and walk around the area - perfect for a week :) The area itself, unfortunately quite dirty, but it's not a fault the hotel and the Sicilian mentality and attention to cleanliness.","194":"Both owners Patricia and Giuseppe are crazy nice. The building is wonderfully decorated. Breakfast in a charming environment, arranged on a beautifully adapted terrace. Perfect room. Ratio value money excellent","195":"classic B&B. Three rooms tastefully decorated and equipped. Each with its own bathroom. The host, Patricia, is a living example of Italian hospitality and warmth. Together with her husband Giuseppe, she was able to create an unforgettable atmosphere. I highly recommend this place. In the morning, a wonderful breakfast is served on the top floor. Coffee drunk on the terrace with a view of the Enna panorama tastes great. Note for parking cars - access to the car park is quite winding and requires considerable skills of drivers. Narrow streets and tight curves.","196":"The hotel is very well located on the main, representative street of the city. Perfectly connected with the train station, airport and even the port. The breakfasts are plentiful and varied. Room clean, well-kept, cleaned every day. The bathroom is fully equipped. Vertical communication via a quick lift or stairs. Lots of shops, restaurants and bars around the hotel.","197":"Honestly, it's hard for me to say unequivocally whether I recommend it or not. So he will describe his impressions, step by step. We'll start with the minuses - location. When deciding on this hotel, you have two options - either rent a car or a scooter for the entire trip, which will be very expensive in Palermo (renting a scooter for one day costs \u20ac 50), or prepare a lot of cash for daily commuting by hotel transfer, because after all, within 5 kilometers from the hotel, there isn't even a shop. The hotel offers travel to the nearest beach for 15 \u20ac per person (2 people transfer), and 7 \u20ac to the city center. Apparently not expensive, but counting the commute for the entire holiday, the sum is already unpleasant - the cost of over 100 \u20ac FOR TRANSPORT ONLY. A lot. If you decide to stay in the hotel for #restday, be aware that you will not leave it, because there will simply be nowhere. The road to the nearest beach is 12 km and 8 km to the center of Palermo. Of course, you can go on foot, but in the long run - 3 hours one way from the shoe at 35 degrees is a drama. Another thing - food. You can't say a bad word about the food itself, it's delicious in terms of taste, the portions are quite small, but it's typical for Italians, so you can't pick on it either. However, it must be admitted that it is not the cheapest. In the center of Palermo, you can buy pasta for \u20ac 5, in the hotel the price varies between \u20ac 12-14. A big plus is the service, very nice, polite and always smiling. The restaurant patio itself is impressive, you can perfectly feel the atmosphere of Italy. The third issue is the pools. This is definitely a plus of the hotel. They have a beautiful view of the city skyline, they are also never overcrowded. The only drawback for me was their closing time - 20:00. Unfortunately, after dark, it was impossible to even go out to the terrace, lie down on a deckchair to admire, or jump into the pool. Languages. It was bad here, only at the reception you could communicate in English. The hotel service and waiters knew single words, which made it a bit difficult to get things done. It seemed to me that a hotel in the famous Palermo would be better linguistically adapted to tourists. The next thing is peace. It was also very good here. Rooms cleaned every day, very nice room, beautiful view from the balcony for the evening chillout. The last thing - transport from the airport to the hotel. A very efficient, elegant Mercedes, but we had to ask for the return transfer 3 times, because no one at the reception desk could take care of it and there was no reservation for it on the day of departure. Summarizing,","198":"Standard rooms at the Ibis level. Purely. No kettles or tea \/ coffee making facilities in the rooms. The hotel needs a refresh. Breakfasts good. Dirty cutlery, sticking to washing. Only 16 free parking spaces. Almost always busy. Other parking spaces are charged 8 Euro per day. Area full of meneli offering parking services.","199":"Enzo welcomed us with a delicious drink with ice - perfect for a hot day. The building with rooms is located in a beautiful, well-kept, tasteful garden. Breakfasts prepared with the heart and the coffee (capuccino) perfect.","200":"The location is favorable for walking around the center of Palermo - the vicinity of monuments, street food, restaurants, etc. The object itself was most probably converted from a large apartment, separating rooms for tourists. They are well equipped (tv, wi fi ..) except for the bathroom which is shared by several rooms. This is a serious drawback, especially that the toilet is not separated from the bathing part and when someone takes a longer bath in the bath (no shower), others do not even have a chance to wash their hands. First of all, this is zero intimacy, and then the noise in the corridor most of the night and the unfavorable glances of the neighbors the next morning. On the plus side, hearty breakfasts with a large selection of bread and additives.","201":"We booked accommodation there through a well-known booking portal. The room rental price was very low for Palermo. I was a bit afraid of the conditions that I would see there, but wrongly.\r We got a room with a shared bathroom. The bed and breakfast was very, very clean. You could park your car free of charge downstairs.\r In the morning, a tasty and rich breakfast awaited us.\r The owners are the family. Parents, son and daughter. All very friendly and helpful.\r Right in the center of Palermo.\r \r I recommend it to everyone for long and short stays.","202":"It was a good stop for sleeping. Room 411 is simple and comfortable. The staff is attentive, has a restaurant and on-site parking. Satisfactory breakfast. And the location is excellent for those traveling by car.","203":"We stayed in a large suite with a bathtub, a plus offered by the attendant. Hotel well located with a beautiful view of the ferry boat port. We went and walked back from the center. We really enjoyed breakfast and dinner, a Mediterranean buffet, which is worth it (18 euros).","204":"Spacious bedroom and bathroom. Good reception service. It is located very close to the tourist spots. About 500 m. It has free parking behind the hotel. A practical hotel for those who just need a bath and a room to sleep.","205":"Close to the train station - we went on foot, the Quintocanto Hotel and Spa is on Via Vit\u00f3rio Emanuele, between several historical points and the sea. When we arrived at the hotel, we were told that the only apartment available had no elevator - but it was on the first floor. Even so, it was a pleasant surprise: our apartment had a small sitting room, a TV room and a huge room, facing the street. The breakfast met our expectations. And to top it off, the location is perfect for getting to know the main sights.","206":"We booked this hotel through the Smiles frequent flyer program and were delighted to simply stay in the best location in Palermo! It is on the main corner, on the main street of the city, you can see all the sights walking, several options of restaurants and food nearby, the hotel itself has a wonderful restaurant that serves a delicious breakfast, worth every penny !!! I recommend it because everything was perfect! Exquisite decoration, comfortable beds, room with excellent acoustics and temperature (we went in winter), bathroom with chromotherapy, building with elevator, impeccable service! I only regret not having used the SPA services, which must be divine.","207":"Place away from the turmoil, retrofitted with great taste without exaggeration, clean atmosphere in addition to a service, relaxed, impeccable and always concerned with guests. The restaurant has good options if you don't want to go out for dinner at night.","208":"A BB, modern .clean. The rooms are modern with flat screen TV, minibar, wifi, complete and modern bathroom. With electric coffee maker and tea making equipment. My apartment even had a balcony. The sister owners Helena and Larissa, super helpful and friendly. The breakfast is served by the owners in a small modern room. Well located. Great cost benefit. Just arriving at night is tricky as it is on a small street, perpendicular to Consolare Pompei, a large avenue by the sea.","209":"The best B&B in Sicily ... the owners Helena and Larissa very friendly and helpful. The best hostesses I found in Italy. The whole place is very tasteful, clean, 100% wifi. You are asked what each guest would like for breakfast and everything is well served and delicious. Near the beach. Good restaurants. Very well located. I'll be back soon!","210":"The hotel is close to the main square, shopping and other walking tours. Everything is dry in the hotel, without waste, but nothing is missing. Very good. We usually use this type of hotel to sleep only. The breakfast is very good, delicious croissants.","211":"Nice hostel, neat breakfast and good living room. I arrived at dawn and they waited for me even though the reception was already closed. The location is excellent and the staff are friendly. I recommend.","212":"The hotel is 7 km from the center of Palermo. Very beautiful and well-groomed interior. The staff is friendly, ready to help at any time of the day or night (at night it took a medicine for a cold to my boyfriend - they gave it). The room is clean enough, there is everything for a comfortable stay. There is free parking. The breakfasts are delicious and varied.","213":"BB is located in the very center of the city - indeed, Centro Storico! the reception is around the corner - at BB Giulia. the rooms are clean and quiet, breakfast is included in the room rate. the staff are nice and friendly. immediately opposite the entrance is the Il Giglio pizzeria - I recommend it, the pizza is very tasty and inexpensive, the very enterprise with an interesting family history! BB Centro Storico is very suitable for exploring Caltanissetta, all the most interesting places of the city are within walking distance. our family with 2 teenage children was satisfied :)","214":"We were looking for a hotel for one night, wanted to walk around Palermo. The location is gorgeous, next to a street with restaurants and shops. There is breakfast for a fee. The room is clean and comfortable. I liked the shower room, which has a bidet and care products (cream, intimate gel, soap, shampoo). There is free Wi-Fi. Unfortunately there were no free rooms for 3 people, but we were given a spacious room with a large bed. It was comfortable. The hotel has an interesting design and a very pleasant smell. We liked! We advise!","215":"We spent 6 glorious days here. The apartment, with cooking facilities, was spacious, clean and comfortable. Ultimiately, we didn't use the kitchen, because Silvia's dinners were so wonderful. The views of the landscape from the terraced gardens are beautiful. I cannot say enough about the warm welcome from Silvia and her husband Bruno. Memories of dinners shared with our hosts and other travelers are interesting among the sweet souvenirs of our trip to Sicily.","216":"Since we were sailing from Messina on a cruise, we were looking for a hotel near the port. What were rewarded with !!! In the morning. Woke up. Saw the colossus of our liner, almost near us !!!! Spectacular! Near the Cathedral. Small family hotel. Nice hostess! Perfect cleanliness Before moving in, we were allowed to leave things (there is no storage room) Unfortunately, I did not have time to swim under hot water at night, but there was some temporary problem, the hostess was worried, she was fussing, but could not do anything. In the morning everything was in order. Water again was..Breakfast was (modest for those who have a hearty breakfast, but for us everything is fine) Coffee, milk, yogurt, cookies, juice. We were satisfied. Wi-fi is available, the speed is good.","217":"Nice hotel with nice staff. In the center of major attractions. The disadvantage is the lack of parking. The noise of the central streets is heard in the rooms. The pizza downstairs is delicious. Everything in the rooms is comfortable, clean and tidy. WIfi works well.","218":"We did not expect much from the hotel and did the right thing. Plus, a beautiful view of the Strait of Messina and mainland Italy, the ability to use the kitchen and washing machine (we did not use it), silence (since the hotel is located away from busy roads), a beautiful living room with a piano (the child constantly strummed the keys), the opportunity to sit in the evening on the terrace and enjoy nature. Minus breakfasts, it's even difficult to call them that. Mostly muffins, cookies, croissants from packages with a bunch of preservatives. The room is not very well cleaned. We were given a triple room, but they took it as for a double, which is also not bad)))","219":"We were lucky enough to visit this beautiful place and enjoy the atmosphere of the villa and its hospitality. Comfortable and spacious rooms with every comfort and attention to detail. Luxury cosmetics. Well-kept garden with impressive century-old trees. Lovely pool area and spacious spa. Excellent restaurant. Refined and delicious cuisine. The villa offers an unforgettable view of the Strait of Messina. We definitely recommend and hope to return there again.","220":"The warmest welcome in all of Sicily is right here! From Caltanissetta, the bike tour of Sicily began. Arriving in the city, they discovered a breakdown of the bicycle pump, there was nowhere to buy bicycle parts in Caltanisetta and the owner helped us with the purchase in another city! - The location is very favorable: literally less than a hundred meters from the station. If you go to Agrigento, for example. you can easily catch the earliest train. At the same time, 7-10 minutes walk to the Duomo and the central streets at a very leisurely pace. - The place is very quiet, an old pre-war house with traces of bombs on the facade, standing in its own garden. There is a parking space for several cars on the territory of the garden - I can recommend this place for all car travelers. - The house itself, furniture and appliances are in excellent condition, the guest rooms are spacious, the room for four is simply huge. - Breakfast for Sicily is varied and delicious. But the most important thing is the extraordinary hospitality with which we were met at the hotel! I can safely recommend it to everyone who travels around Sicily.","221":"For me, as a traveler, first of all, the item \"cleanliness\" is very important. Here, out of 10 possible points, I would put 11! Here you can not turn on the air conditioner even in extreme heat The building is old. Cool and fresh. Very comfortable. A very stylish and beautiful place! In the very center of Enna. The bus stop, from where buses leave for many destinations, including the Outlet Sicilia Grand Village, is a 3-minute walk. To Castello 5-7 minutes on foot without rushing. The breakfasts are wonderful: fruits, prosciutto, cheeses, pastries, yoghurts. The only thing I don't understand is that breakfasts don't always take place in b & b; sometimes you are offered to have breakfast in a bar on the corner, where you will not see fruit, yoghurts, prosciutto, or cheeses, but only pastries (one position) and coffee. The hostess of the B&B Patricia is just great! The energy in her is off scale! When I found out that our bus was arriving at Enna bassa, she kindly offered to pick us up with our suitcases from the stop and give us a lift to the b & b, which is quite a long distance (you definitely can't walk on foot). If I return to Annu, then only here!","222":"Check-in went well. Large and nice room. Clean and fresh. Good Wi-Fi. The hotel is a bit outside Palermo but it was possible to take the bus into the center. We got two large rooms. The breakfast was very good.","223":"The hotel is well located for discovering Palermo. We stayed in the junior suite, nicely furnished but that a hotel with 4 stars only has plastic glass in a junior suite is not ok. Good Wi-fi, comfortable bed. The breakfast room is crowded, the breakfast selection leaves a bit to be desired. Would have liked more cold cuts, vegetables and fruit. Overall a perfectly ok hotel.","224":"Central location in Messina near the port. Clean and fresh. Large room clean and fresh. Good Wi-Fi. Unfortunately the breakfast was not good there was hardly anything. Messina is a small town and unfortunately there was not much to see.","225":"The location was excellent and the service good. It is not true that they have any parking but they followed and showed us where we could park the car. The breakfast was very good. The bed could have been better but on the other hand it was a very low price for the rooms. We would love to stay there again.","226":"This place is located upstairs in a stairwell so you were a little hesitant when you found the place. But then they were so pleasantly surprised. At the reception there were really nice women. They offered coffee and cake when we arrived. The room was fresh and nice (we arrived on Valentine's Day and then they had decorated the room extra), the breakfast was excellent and there we got the best chocolate croissant in the whole Sicily week. There is really only positive thing to say about this b & b. I would rather stay here again than in a hotel. The location is also good. In the room below is a lovely patisserie. I really recommend this accommodation.","227":"A bit away from the hustle and bustle of the city is this Hotel BB. Responsive and friendly staff who help with most things. Simple but ok breakfast. Bright rooms with comfortable beds. Clean everywhere and access to simple toiletries. Easy check-in even when the reception is not staffed. Affordable.","228":"Pretty newly built small hotel located just outside Agrigento. There are only 5 rooms but we were lucky to get one. Clean and fresh everywhere. The room was cozy and even had a terrace. Wi-fi worked great. The breakfast was very good. Bread, butter, cold cuts, juices, yoghurts, various cereals, eggs, fruit salad, fantastic pastries. Very cozy and familiar place that I can warmly recommend. Stefania was very helpful and also gave us maps and tips on sights.","229":"The rooms are large and have high ceilings. Mine also had two balconies facing Piazza Borsa. The location is excellent at the intersection of Via Roma and Via Vittorio Emanuele, so most sights are within walking distance. For those who do not want to go, there is a free bus that circles the central parts of Palermo, one of its stops where it gets approx. once every half hour is right next to this BnB on Via Roma. The breakfast is good and varied, wifi also works well. This BnB is located on the third floor so noise from the street car traffic etc. is quite muted. Last but not least, I would like to commend Raffaella and Manfredi who run this place. I thought they were very nice, and also professional in a good way. Both have a good knowledge of everything that has to do with Palermo and Sicily and are happy to share. Anders Ljungqvist","230":"After the description on booking.com and all the fantastic o, vr our expectations are quite high in the room and we had booked a junior suite .... Positive - the owner very helpful and serviceminded and quick to respond to questions. The cleanliness was excellent as well as the location right in the middle of the batter in terms of shopping, nightly and restaurants. The room was large and comfortable. Negative - only the owner who spoke English other staff could not speak English. The standard of the room did not match the description, the balcony was a ventilated balcony and the mother was a shabby yard and a worn house at a distance of about 1.5 meters. The single beds that would be in the room were bed armchairs. Misleading description of everything that would be in the room such as a safe turned out to be in the reception .. Ok - the breakfast was what mn could expect and the discounted price corresponded to the standard.","231":"Small and family owned. Nice house with large terrace adjacent to the room. Spacious bathroom with hand-painted tiles and double sinks. The breakfast consisting of locally produced products was served in the garden.","232":"Absolutely affordable, the most comfortable comfortable and clean luxury hotel of the man is a complete family hotel, both its employees and the deceased Osman M\u0131r\u0131z are smiling people.We have been going for 5 years, I am definitely not tired because the hotel that welcomes you like kings is a hotel with statues and museums, in addition to its exquisite food, 4 large pools and the seaside is nothing besides them anyway","233":"The rooms are large, even a fully equipped washing machine is available. 10 steps from the central etnea street Also very close to the historical center Staff very kind and helpful Everything was great again Thanks","234":"If you are with children, the hotel is not for you at all. The entrance to the hotel is disastrous. The hotel is like an abandoned inn. Rooms are on the 4th floor, there is no elevator. There is no hair dryer, no kettle, no water in the rooms, let alone the mini bar. Rooms are freezing at night in November. There is only air conditioning, it is not enough for heating. The terrace where only breakfast is served is beautiful. Okey if you are a student and go in summer. Apart from that, give some more money and stay somewhere nice.","235":"The staff are friendly and very helpful. Walking distance to everywhere in the center of Catania. It is close to the open market that is set up every day until noon. It is also an advantage to be close to the closed-floor car park. This is important as car rental companies find Catania very risky.","236":"As two bikers, we arrived late one night after 600 km. We found it via Booking, but we couldn't make a reservation. We got the address and came to the door. It came to our inexperience, we did not notice that it was B&B. We opened the phone, and the gentleman who got on the phone clearly told us how to open the safe next to the door and which key to take. With the inexperience of the first time, we found the room a little concerned. Despite the possibility of staying until the morning and running away without paying money, someone who trusts the customer on the phone, helps as much as he can, is smiling, speaks understandable English, we bargained, did not force the price. Pros; Very close to the most beautiful places, large room, comfortable beds, stylish bathroom (shared), nice decoration, central location. Air conditioning, TV, Internet available, they provide towels. Things to pay attention; The elevator is only for suitcases, there is a bidet in the toilets, there is no bidet tap, the breakfast consists of only sweets, the bathroom is shared, the toilet is shared, have your needs for the night (water, snacks) Cons; The price is a bit high, it is very close to the two main streets and there are traffic lights right next to it, there is traffic day and night and it is full of engines that make a lot of noise. It would be a nuisance for those looking for a quiet place.","237":"It is not even less to give 5 stars to this hotel .. The location is great, right in the center, everywhere is within walking distance. Newly renovated, rooms are very nice. All employees and manager are very nice, helpful. Elevator, hair dryer, minibar, kettle ... everything is available. The breakfast is very nice. Rooms are warm in winter though. It is very top class compared to another Hotel in the center of Catania where we stayed before. It is especially good for children. We highly recommend it.","238":"The owner and the working ladies are tearing themselves apart to help, no questions remain unanswered my location is perfect walking everywhere rooms big and spacious breakfast the best breakfast we have had during European holidays, the price is cheap in performance parking is within walking distance and free for the hotel","239":"The location is very central, the owners are very concerned. The whole hotel and the room are immaculate. Comfortable, affordable, safe, interior design is very harmonious and new .. everything has been considered. Free internet available. Room breakfast. You can make breakfast with tea, coffee, fruit, cake, cookies, rusks, jam, or you can take it from the outside or cook it yourself. There is slippers, ear pads and a set for brushing teeth.\r But I am very sure that I will not go to this area again, I wish we hadn't had theft the minute we landed. we saw that the area is not haunted, the back sides are suburbs and auto repairs. Our luggage was stolen from the vehicle. Hotel owners helped us a lot in police operations. We stopped our holiday on the 1st day and returned to our country. The owner of the hotel showed good will and returned a small part of it. Thanks to the hotel Bruno for everything ..","240":"Although the hotel has 5 stars, it was not maintained\nI guess it's a horse racing hotel and inadequate staff except events. Apart from that, the hotel is spacious, large bathroom, wonderful rooms are also very spacious. Breakfast is enough. We are not afraid when looking for a night hotel without lights.","241":"We went with two families and we were very comfortable, Peppe is very helpful, the location is comfortable, especially you do not have a car park problem. There are equipment to meet all your needs in the house .. Siracusa is one of the must-see places.","242":"When we arrived from Palermo airport shortly before midnight on Friday evening without luggage, the concierge served us a glass of wine as a nightcap. We were two couples and spent a long weekend at the Prinicip di Villafranca. The staff was extremely friendly. The rooms are functional and nicely and practically furnished. Comfortable beds, good bathroom and clean parquet floors. As usual in Palermo, in the morning it is loud from the streets of the city. The crew recommended and made reservations for very good restaurants, and the hotel also organized a guided tour for us. The hotel is highly recommended, we will stay there again.","243":"The house or the entrance itself is a bit set back from the main street and my room was at the back and was therefore very quiet. The room corresponds to the pictures shown and is very lovingly furnished. Particularly noteworthy are the shutters on the windows and the balcony, as well as the elevator, so that the annoying lugging of suitcases is no longer necessary. The hostess was helpful with parking (tip: Better to go to the parking lot at Viale Annunziata, free on Sundays and otherwise only from 3:30 p.m. to around 8:00 p.m.). As a welcome there was a plate of watermelon, which I really enjoyed after the hard and warm day. The hostess gave me great tips and also explained how to get to the city center by tram. There was even a free ticket (there and back) for the tram, for which I thank you again. For breakfast there was, among other things, the regional specialty brioche with granita and an explanation of how this is \"properly\" eaten. Not my case though, so I switched to the other dishes. The host Elena is very welcoming and I had very good conversations with her in English. She was not only interested in where from and where in Sicily, but also in my person. I also learned a lot about the hostess, which I found very interesting. I can definitely recommend this B&B! Great value for money, even if a free cancellation was not possible (at least when I booked).","244":"On our round trip we also stayed in Enna for one night and slept there. (Family, 2 children) The apartment on the ground floor was very nicely and stylishly furnished. All clean. Breakfast was also varied and delicious. The hosts are very, very nice. With pleasure again.","245":"The hotel looks more like Milan from the outside, but is very modern and well-kept inside. Rooms are quite large and clean, the bathroom is small but ok. The walls are unfortunately a bit noisy and the breakfast is not too big (Italy), but otherwise we slept very well here. Close to the center of Palermo (10 minutes on foot) and super close to many great shops. Very helpful and courteous staff. We were even allowed to put our motorcycle in front of the garage. Internally it works a little slowly but you don't have time for it anyway. Gladly again.","246":"A top B&B like you would otherwise have to look for. On the top floor completely undisturbed with a magnificent view. Round bed, many designer details, everything very tastefully decorated. Breakfast is also perfect. In addition, very nice owner who waited at the turnoff to the feeder road and guided us through the narrowest street. Adventurous when there is still one centimeter of space on each side of a Peugeot 208 with the side mirrors folded up ...","247":"My girlfriend and I stayed at the Ibis style Palermo Centro in Palermo in December 2019. We were extremely satisfied. The hotel itself is centrally located - everything is within walking distance, pedestrian zone in the immediate vicinity, plane bus just around the corner. The house is clean and well-kept, the rooms are large, clean and comfortable. The breakfast is very good for Italian standards! There are eggs, ham, cheese, sweets, yoghurts, fruit etc. The staff at the reception is incredibly friendly and helpful. When booking, I hadn't pointed out that I wanted two beds in a double room and was given a double room with one bed when I checked in, but the next morning we were able to move straight to a double room with two beds. Thanks again for that. We can definitely recommend the hotel. The price performance ratio is very good. Everything fits. Thanks again!","248":"Probably the best B&B in Enna. Very clean and stylish premises. Breakfast is very good too. The landlords are very friendly and familiar. We can highly recommend it. We will definitely stay there again next time we visit.","249":"If we had known what to expect, we would have stayed three nights! Pamela and Guiseppe are born hosts, with great attention to detail and their own design style! The breakfast buffet was the burner and the many tips are enough for three days of visiting archeology, culture, history, gastronomy and other sights in the center of Sicily: grinning:","250":"A lot of price, no performance. Even the reception was extremely unfriendly, you were not accompanied to the room and there was no additional information. The suites were very different: One very large and beautiful, the other rather small, did not correspond to any suite. The breakfast buffet was underground. The coffee is undrinkable, the orange juice is artificial and everything else is dry and absolutely not fresh. The service unkempt and unfriendly. The lunch (about 5 people in a huge hall) was inedible. When we checked out, the bill was handed to us without comment (we speak fluent Italian - silence is international ...) and there was no goodbye or a friendly word. A very expensive but disappointing stay!","251":"Looking out from our window you could swear you were in the sea ....we were that close. Very quiet and large rooms with Windows that open. You could lie on the bed and look out to sea. Great central location with lots of bars and restaurants within easy walking distance.  The bar on the top floor was great and we would have enjoyed sitting outside if it wasn't so unseasonably wet while we were there. This was also the breakfast room and they made a very good coffee. The staff were so friendly especially the lovely Giussi ! Can highly recommend this hotel as a great place to stay in Trapani.","252":"We had a very comfortable stay at Delle Vittorie. Rooms were clean and comfortable, the innkeepers were kind and helpful, and the breakfast buffet was fresh and plentiful. Good strong coffee is made to order. Location is central to almost all sights in Palermo.","253":"We spent one night at this fine boutique hotel in Trapani and quite frankly the pictures on the internet don\u2019t do it justice. The staff is very attentive and personable, wanting to make sure your stay is worry free and enjoyable.The bar and breakfast room is on the roof top with wonderful views, sofas and ample shade for those wishing to stay out of the sun. Our room overlooked the piazza. Parking was street parking by meter as described but this was no problem and in fact we could see our rental car from our room. When we checked in we were told that the rate for our room had dropped and gave us 2 complimentary breakfasts. The location is proximate to many restaurants and shops. Complimentary bottled water is provided as well.","254":"the twins were amazing from start to finish. Helpful when we arrived with parking, restaurant suggestions and information about the surrounding area. The apartment style hotel room was clean, updated and really cool, right in the middle of it all. I would stay again.","255":"Nice hotel, great location and view FromThe room. I don\u2019t give them 5 stars because they don\u2019t have parking. You can park on the street nearby . The view from The breakfast bar is also great. It is ay walking distance from all The important spots of the City","256":"This B&B is luxuriously appointed and has a great location just around the corner from one of the main pedestrian streets in Palermo. Just steps from major sites, restaurants and shops, it is the perfect location for visitors. The owner is very friendly and helpful. Transportation from the airport can also be arranged. The selection of pastries for breakfast was excellent.","257":"Behind a big wooden door- you enter a dark entry with an elevator from the year of the flood.. what you might expect from a Times Square hotel that charges by the hour.  But have faith- one floor up - there is another door to the B&B- and you enter another world. Modern- clean- comfortable room- excellent bath- and quiet considering you are in the center of Palermo . ( yards from the main walking street ) Nice buffet breakfast too. Only negative- hundreds of channels in Italian and not one in English- but who has time for TV. Ask Frederica anything before arrival or after- and it is done. Recommended","258":"The staff were so welcoming it made the stay a nicer experience. The location is perfect right in the historic area. The road outside the hotel was to be closed the next morning due to a run which was taking place so we had to park the car in a nearby car park. This was no hassle at all and took about 5 mins to walk back to the hotel. Breakfast was just ok nothing special but as we got a good deal this wasn\u2019t a problem. If asked would we recommend this hotel, the answer is yes, and would gladly stay there again if we were in the area.","259":"Selected this place based on reviews and it did not disappoint. Martina welcomed us and gave us the lay of the land; very centrally located, easy walk to all important sites. Clean, comfortable, and homey - including a wonderful breakfast. Definitely recommended.","260":"We loved this hotel! We found parking very easily by the hotel (free on the weekends and pay during the weekdays). The rooms are incredibly spacious with a large modern bathroom. The breakfast spread was delicious and the staff was so helpful with anything we asked them. I would highly recommend La Gancia.","261":"It does not reach the pension category. Scarce breakfast and very old facilities ... No WI-FI service !!! I was staying for three weeks and during all that time they kept me longing about the constant repairs that my room required. I feel like I was teased. WE WILL NOT RETURN.","262":"The hotel is located in a well communicated area with services. Also, the rooms are large and comfortable. In our case, we were assigned a small apartment with a dining room and built-in kitchen, apart from the (gigantic) bedroom and bathroom. Regarding the bathroom, it was small and old, .... but despite its bad appearance, it was clean. As for breakfast, it is quite scarce and they only offer sweets: biscuits, cakes, some fruit, juices and coffee from the machine. Calling attention to the reception hours: from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m., so if you arrive later, you will find yourself in a little problem since you will have to contact by calling a mobile phone and crossing your fingers waiting for a answer, .... In our case, after waiting almost a quarter of an hour, it coincided that a couple of Italians arrived who were the ones who managed to locate the receptionist by phone, ask her to open up and explain how to proceed, since there was no no one at the reception, ....","263":"A group of 10 people traveled to Palermo to celebrate a birthday, from the first moment Federico has been exceptionally helpful in organizing lunches and dinners, excursions, activities and above all making us feel as if we were at home. Federico and the Palazzo Sovrana team have made our stay easy and have made this vacation very special and unforgettable.","264":"We had a huge disappointment with this hotel. A room where the two of us could barely fit, beds so narrow that the arms dangled at the sides, and to top it off a bad breakfast. We will never go back.","265":"Well located hotel in a quiet area, not far from the city center. Comfortable and spacious room. Limited garage in terms of space. Correct breakfast, although the part of hot products is little varied and sometimes with absences.","266":"Excellent b & b. It is located in an old building, but when you open the elevator door, you find a spectacular place. Both Larisa and Corina are in every detail, always attentive and ready to help in everything. First class rooms as well as breakfast. If you go to messina, do not stop going !!!!","267":"Located in Messina, a neighborhood away from the center and located between blocks of buildings, ideal to spend a night when you go en route around the island or to catch a ferry to Calabria. Exceptional treatment very very attentive, excellent room, new and modern, with water in the fridge and modern toilet and more than correct, everything very clean and very good typical breakfast, correct price. Nearby area with restaurants, pizzerias etc ...","268":"It is located in a quiet street, with parking. It is a very nice place, Carmelo, its owner, is a very polite and very kind person. The cleaning is 10 and the treatment is fantastic. Beautiful room, and comfortable. Without a doubt if you go to messina, you can rest in that place. I will return, without a doubt.","269":"good idea to build an old palace in the center and add a divine restaurant. Impeccable exercise and quality service. No car necessary. Comfortable rooms and good air conditioning.","270":"We spent 3 nights with the family at this superb hotel. We had a wonderful family room with a very quiet terrace. The bedding is top notch and the sanitary facilities are very modern. The hotel's hyper-central location in the old town is ideal for exploring the city on foot and easily returning to rest. The hotel has a wooded patio-type courtyard which is a haven of peace. The breakfasts are very good with very efficient teams and service. The big plus is the valet parking which makes your life so much easier if you have a car as it is almost impossible to park nearby. I totally recommend and regret not having had the time to try the hotel restaurant. Surely next time.","271":"B & B with Reception service. Very correct rooms, perhaps the triple room to be avoided, a little small and small beds, very good for children or teenagers ... Savory breakfast prepared to order, sweet on the buffet. But the big plus of this \u201chotel\u201d is its location in the heart of the lively, historic and commercial district of Messina.","272":"Really a very good address: welcome, kindness, friendliness cleanliness, really perfect. Excellent breakfast. Very pleasant staff. To recommend in the city. : parking service by the hotel, very efficient. A pleasure to stay there.","273":"An establishment which deserves a maximum score at all levels. Professionalism, courtesy, location, service, everything is at the top. In the heart of the old town, a valet will take care of your luggage and your car. A beautiful interior courtyard connects the hotel to the restaurant which serves excellent Sicilian cuisine. In addition, one of the very few hotels in Italy where you can benefit from heating after April 15th. To discover and taste without moderation.","274":"The view from this place is magnificent ideal place to rest in peace the owners and the young girl who prepares the breakfasts for you are adorable little flat for the bedding the mattress is not firm enough and the dinner of the first evening my a little disappointed but overall we had a pleasant stay thank you the bruno couple","275":"It is not easy to access (the road is not of very good quality: we wondered if we were not going in the wrong direction!) But the place is really worth the detour. We arrive there and we are immediately relaxed ... A real haven of peace. The panorama is very pleasant, the rooms are large and adequate, with everything you need. In the evening we ate what Silvia had concocted and it was simply delicious! The portions were generous, in short we had a great time, around discussions about the food and a bit of everything. The breakfast was very good too. The place seemed ideal for families. And how cute were the kittens!","276":"Very well located near many tourist locations. Friendly and professional welcome and staff. Room with sober decoration, spacious and very clean. Same as bathroom. Excellent bedding. Superb breakfast taken on the roof top with an extraordinary view of Palermo, which alone justifies the choice of the hotel. You can also dine there with always this magnificent view, night version, excellent restaurant. Small flat, despite the elevator that serves the floors, access to the restaurant is on the top floor by a flight of stairs, which can be complicated for people with reduced mobility. Our room facing the avenue, the exterior insulation was ok, however the stairwell is noisy.","277":"We stayed from 14 to 16 August. Very kind owner, he contacted us while we were still traveling and declared himself willing to wait for us and so it was. Spacious and clean rooms as well as private bathrooms. Excellent breakfast. Thanks to Fabio, to his father and to the exquisite Vittoria. We will definitely meet again","278":"The only positive note is the welcome of the girls and the central point of the B&B, then everything negative! The room is cold with an old air conditioner that does not turn on, there is no power plug other than the plug behind the TV, which also didn't work in my room and I had to synchronize the channels several times, very uncomfortable bed with the blankets all thrown to the right and very noisy!","279":"We had a room, small, cold, and with the ceiling full of cracks from water infiltrations. Not enough water heater even for a shower. Window with poor frame, without shutters, with a poorly attached curtain. Old and very noisy air conditioning. Uncomfortable spring mattresses etc ..... I do not recommend.","280":"I booked this b & b in the summer for some friends who came by surprise from Matera: they were satisfied with both the rooms and the owners! Easy street parking than walking around the center! Very close to the sea","281":"I was with my family from December 29 to January 2 and I was very happy. Let's now move on to the evaluation: The location is excellent (in the center), parking is a little less expensive and is often not available. However, it must be said that the receptionist immediately gave me the keys to their garage (very small, barely two cars) in case I couldn't find parking. The room was very spacious and warm, cleanliness was good. The bathroom was medium in size with the only drawback \"the water heater\". So you have to organize for showers otherwise the hot water runs out. The only annoyance is that breakfast is served in a side bar on the street and not internally despite having a small breakfast room. On the other hand, the courtesy and helpfulness of the staff is very positive. The price is normal. \u20ac 65 for a triple a day can fit.","282":"I state that I was a guest of friends, so I can not evaluate the price. We come to the strengths: The atmosphere is friendly, the staff, especially the cleaning staff, were extremely friendly and helpful. The central location is very convenient, the rooms are clean and the wi-fi worked great. As for the single room, it only had a tiny window, for some claustrophobic people it could be a problem. The points to improve can be some finishes (the shower had the plastic removed) and the breakfast, not abundant but still sufficient. A comfortable and peaceful stay all in all.","283":"We were guests at this property on the night of the first Saturday in August. This B&B is in a great location, not far from the ferry dock and a short walk from the historic center and the beautiful cathedral. The staff is really very kind and available to our every request! The very comfortable and very clean rooms, the simple but excellent breakfast and as if that were not enough, served in a cute room overlooking the sea! If we happen to be in Messina again we will definitely stay here!","284":"The staff (including the restaurant staff) were very good. Among them, Mr. David. For me who departed early in the morning, he arranged a breakfast and negotiated a taxi fare. I didn't mind the sound of the waves in the room directly below the sea. The hotel is not new, but the rooms were clean and the beds comfortable. When I closed the shutter and closed the glass door, I couldn't hear the outside sound and it was a quiet night. There is a famous restaurant nearby, and it is a very close hotel to the morning market, and it is a recommended hotel to stay here again!","285":"The parking lot is the site behind the building. At the entrance, turn right at the post office next to the B&B. Since the B&B itself has to enter the ZTL road, it is quite difficult to understand and it takes courage at first, but please tell me the number at check-in, police? I will contact you.\n\nThe room was clean. The amount of hot water is sufficient. Breakfast was also delicious. I didn't understand the button of the air conditioner of Fiat500 and kindly told me. The staff feels good. Parking is free, which is rare on Ordilla Island.","286":"The room was super large because I chose a room where 4 people could stay even though I was 2 people. The roof was high and it was a corner room, so it was bright and nice. Is the breakfast place small? There was a public car park right next to the hotel, and when I checked in to the hotel, I received a parking permit, so it was free. After all, it is convenient that the parking lot is close to the hotel. Ortigia isn't that big, so it was okay to walk the island from this hotel.","287":"In February 2020, I stayed for 3 nights as a base for a trip in eastern Sicily.\nThis small B&B is a renovated interior of a historic building near the spring of Arethusa.\nThe booked Quadruple-Room (No.5) was on the 2nd floor and was a large room consisting of a main room with a king bed and a second room with 2 single beds.\nThe kitchen is fully equipped with a new air conditioner and refrigerator, so the facilities are perfect. Especially, the bed with crisp sheets and two pillows of memory foam and soft type was comfortable.\nDaily cleaning and towel changes are thoroughly done, and the front desk staff will support you during your stay from morning until around 2000 at night.\nBreakfast begins with tarocco (blood orange) juice, which the owner of the past squeezes himself. Even in February, Sicilian sunshine is a great breakfast served on the warm and comfortable rooftop terrace.\nI can't forget the taste of cappuccino that I was watching the sea through the rooftops of the old town.\n\nThe owner, Stefano, is a kind hard worker who is full of hospitality mind. He was fluent in English and cheerful about traffic conditions in Sicily and local restaurants, and he gave us a lot of advice during his stay.\nIt is thanks to him that this trip based on Syracuse has become an unforgettable one.\nI want to stay again.\nGrazie mille! Stefano.","288":"Good beds, attentive bathroom, great at this price.\nThe interior of the room is Spanish. As everyone wrote, breakfast is wonderful in both atmosphere and content. I went by rental car. When you park your car near the spring and go to the front, you will get in the car and guide you to the parking lot.\nIt is convenient to walk to Piazza Duomo in a few minutes. Early in the morning, I walked through the empty square.","289":"I moved by taxi from the Syracuse bus terminal and stayed for 3 nights. You can walk to anywhere in Ortigia, and the bright red sightseeing bus at Piazza Archimede, which is convenient for traveling around the archeological sites of Greece. The room we stayed in was large enough to face the plaza. Breakfast includes bread, ham, cheese, boiled eggs, yogurt and fruits. It was a hot season so it was a shame that there was no refrigerator in the room, but other than that, there are no particular complaints, so this is a B&B I would recommend to anyone looking for a casual inn.","290":"The suitcase was wide enough. wifi also entered. Depending on the room, you may not be able to enter, so the hotel lobby is sure to enter.\nMoreover, supermarkets are very close here, a general supermarket is a store called DECO, and a slightly higher-class supermarket is a store called GUSTO, which is a souvenir chocolate (there is also a famous Modica chocolate. ), wine, etc. It was an organic supermarket.","291":"The rooms are antique and cute. You can see the Temple of Apollo from the window,\nThe view was good. You can use the kitchen freely, but be careful as coffee McKinetta is dirty, and there are some cafes such as Caffe Olzo whose expiration date has expired.\nIt was a pity that the hot water in the bath was slimy. It has an air conditioner, but it was cold in winter because the ceiling is high. I wish I had some fruits for breakfast\nthought. Ortigia is only accessible to residents by car, so it wasn't too far to walk while rolling a suitcase, and it's good to have a convenient place to walk to the highlights of Ortigia.","292":"Beautiful stay, not difficult to find, room basic but good, bathroom nice, with nice shower of which only the round doors no longer worked properly, wheels broken, unfortunately no fridge in the room, restaurant is very good, breakfast sufficient, coffee not to drink. At the end of the bill, the employee only had an eye for his phone \u201cFacebook\u201d and did not look at us and no thank you or goodbye. Pity.","293":"A beautiful agriturismo hidden in a piece of green in busy Agrigento. The name agriturismo does not really apply here. No farmlands, not really rural. Room equipment was limited but clean. The restaurant is cozy but when the weather is nice and warmer you can probably eat outside which is great. Kitchen was good. When we were there they were clearly not ready for the season. There was nowhere to sit outside. Some rooms have outside seating and if you get the chance you have to reserve it. Fine for 1 night.","294":"This agriturismo is a bit strange at a junction of highways, but that doesn't bother you. You are quickly at the famous temple valley. Excellent rooms and very good restaurant. Free parking and wifi. Staff are friendly especially the waiting staff in the restaurant. Recommended. We had a great room with a balcony.","295":"A wonderful surprise behind a large door in a small street close to teatro massimo. All sights in the city are within walking distance. The owner is very nice and friendly. The B&B has spacious rooms with a beautiful bathroom. Breakfast is fairly standard with fresh pastries and fruit, could have had a little more of a Sicilian touch.","296":"overnight at this Agriturismo for two nights in September. Is very remote and you have to take a strange dirt road to the location. We had a spacious room and everything seemed clean at first. Barefoot on the floor turned out not to be an option because you could feel the dirt under your feet. In the bathroom we discovered a large ant colony and we were plagued by the many centipedes that walked in. Breakfast is not very spacious but satisfies, service there is very friendly. Dinner is highly recommended, the service did their very best and even received a delicious dessert with candle for my birthday. Unfortunately, our traveling party could not go up and down the stairs and they were lifted to her seat. The chef has even carried her from the chair in the restaurant to her bed. In the meantime, extra pillows were neatly provided so that her foot could be held high, very friendly staff and a top service!","297":"Relieved, you get out of your rental car when you reach the domain. The agriturismo is a bit higher up, not accessible via a paved road. The owner has clearly only just started as there is little agriculture to be found on the site. The rooms are spacious, have air conditioning and are very wheelchair friendly. All in all clean, although here and through you still see a few flaws and minor flaws. In my opinion a bad location as you are fairly isolated. Very minimal in terms of breakfast.","298":"During a tour we came here, we had to search, the location is located between various roads, even with navigation a job. The building has recently been refurbished, but is poorly maintained. Bathroom is not clean, there was leakage somewhere. The room was not dust-free, but now there was a lot of dust outside. The surroundings and grounds are messy, not tidy. The rooms of adequate size. Chairs on the terrace are bad. In short, the accommodation is a 5. After breakfast everyone goes out to the temples, etc. When they return home there is only someone present at 5 pm to sell a beer. The evening meal was good, a set menu with plenty of wine and reasonable quality for 20 \u20ac. The whole thing is amateurish. All in all, my assessment was mediocre, something has to change quickly, otherwise it will be a mess within a few years.","299":"This kind of hotel B&B is located 5 km from the Valley of the Temples. An impossible dirt road to get there. Breakfast at 8.30 am At 9 am there was nothing on the table and had little to do with Angriturismo, no local products. Dinner mediocre. Much remains to be done before this location is in order.","300":"Go to Agrigento by car? That way! All the sights and everything your heart desires within a 10-minute drive. Fantastic hotel! Breakfasts are prepared by the family living on the ground floor, who welcomes you - homemade ricotta pie made in the morning by the hostess - priceless! The view is just freaky! Do you want to go to the restaurant? In 5 minutes there is a huge supermarket with excellent food, and on the terrace you can arrange an excellent dinner. By the way, if you book through booking, you should know the photos don't lie!","301":"To begin with, the vaunted Navigon took us to the other end of the street. Fortunately, the owner of the hotel, Mr. Gabriel, promptly informed us about the location of the hotel by SMS. The hotel is located practically in the center of Palermo in an old three-storey building on the second floor and consists of a corridor with a reception, 3 or 4 rooms and a breakfast room. When we arrived, Gabriel was waiting for us on the patio terrace. He took us to the room, which was for a family of three, with an extra bed in a separate room. The room has a TV, a wide comfortable bed, a modern bathroom with a shower, a balcony. The windows overlook a quiet narrow street, which makes it possible to have a good rest at night. WiFi perfectly caught only next to the router, the reception in the room was worse. Gabriel advised us where to go, what to see and where to eat. Dissuaded from paid parking, saying that under the windows the car would spend the night well. Breakfast for the B&B was quite rich. During breakfast, Gabrielle brought a delicious juice, a pineapple-banana mixture. I drank this for the first time and praised the juice, to which Gabriel gave us a whole package of this juice at parting. Gabrielle, if you are reading this review, thank you again for your warm welcome!","302":"There is a private parking. Three hundred meters from the hotel there is a wonderful beach: clear water, gentle entrance, soft sand. A very well-worn hotel. The front desk staff does not speak English. Well, just really. Italian only. Because of this, many problems arose: from the discrepancy between the paid room and the one provided to a completely annoying misunderstanding with the so-called compliment of the hotel. On the birthday of one of us, a bottle of wine was brought to the room. And at the time of discharge, it was included in the bill. Not a bad surprise, isn't it? The language barrier is a serious matter. Well, it was limited only to these misunderstandings, but what if there were really big problems? Breakfast is very, very modest: yogurt and a couple of sandwiches. The shower is tiny, the plumbing is making a terrible noise","303":"Well, for starters, I'll say that Mondello is a suburb of Palermo, located literally 20 minutes from the airport, so I recommend staying here for the night for those who have early departures and late arrivals. In addition, Mondello is famous for the fact that even in November they swim in the sea, and television, making reports about the beautiful Sicilian weather, often show the beach of this town. We originally booked a b & b with a different name and more economical. However, upon arrival, it turned out that the owners were managing 2 structures, and they put us in a newer Il Girasole, which was more expensive on booking. I'll start with the downsides: practically none, except that it will be a bit too far to stomp to the beach, which will be inconvenient for young children and the elderly, especially in the hot months. For all other categories, there will be no problems. Positive: new rooms, non-microscopic, as in many resort cities, good interior, cleanliness, the bathroom does not have hygiene kits in micro-bottles, but normal shower gels and shampoos in standard packaging, the place is quiet, only dogs bark at the neighbors :) very welcoming. We left early in the morning, before breakfast, so they brought us a huge plate of fruit in the evening. What is not unimportant for the resort town, there is parking in the yard. In general, I recommend P.S. Very vigilant with personal belongings on the beach, pliz. Before you have time to turn away, the bag will be carried away. Therefore, money and valuables are always with you in a small purse. Is always! And do not leave your husband with bags and children alone on the beach to run to the supermarket. According to observations, husbands concentrating on children do not see how they steal things from under their noses.","304":"Small family hotel with only 4 rooms. The room is spacious enough. Purely. Bathroom and toilet are small. The room, of course, would not hurt to be refurbished, and the furniture and textiles would be freshened up, but the nature of the place, the friendliness of the hostess and the location pay off. Plus, the price is quite reasonable. Breakfast is relatively modest by choice, but tasty and filling (I especially liked the homemade yogurt). Yes, be prepared for the fact that the Internet signal is extremely weak and unstable - practically, only outside the hours of active use of guests, and only in the living-dining room (common area). The air conditioner is working properly, the mattress is hardish. It will be very noisy outside at night and in the morning - stock up on earplugs.","305":"Very convenient location: not far from the train station, close to historical sights. All rooms are renovated, everything is decorated with great taste, every detail is thought out, equipment and furniture are new, in the kitchen for guests there is a refrigerator, stove, dishes, in the room there is a kettle and a mini-refrigerator, in the shower there is music. Everything is very clean, towels are changed daily, for breakfast - freshly squeezed orange juice, great coffee. Very friendly staff, things can be left before departure at the reception.","306":"Located in the old quarter of Palermo, two minutes from the Teatro Massimo and close to the main street! Free parking under the window, it was important to me! The hosts are hospitable, always with a smile, the atmosphere is super! Breakfasts are ordinary, but for a week I did not get tired of them. Thanks for a wonderful stay! I definitely recommend it!","307":"Excellent hotel near the train station and near the center and the marina. Rooms with balconies, large bathroom, everything is new. Hot breakfast, fruits. Late check-in is possible, the keys are then taken from the safe.","308":"Thank you for a wonderful stay at your home. Very stylish rooms with wonderful paintings, crafts! You can immediately see how the owners love their job! View from the window to the garden with orange and olive trees, where birds sing wonderfully. The hostess and her husband are very hospitable and kind! I loved the lemon pie at breakfast!","309":"Very good typical Sicilian breakfast with lots of sweets, but also bread, cheese and ham. Despite not having on-site parking, the B&B provides free parking in a location close to 100m. Very attentive service.","310":"All communication was done in English by email and the reservation was very easy. We arrived easily at the place and the owner welcomed us. He showed us where to park (private, free, inside the property), the pool, the breakfast place, how to open and close the gate and our room. He also left us a contact number. The room was very spacious, dye a double and a single bed, minibar, air conditioning, large bathroom and a balcony overlooking the internal garden. The location is great for visiting Agrigento historic center, Valle dei Templi and Scala dei Turchi. We stayed 1 night, but we recommend 2 nights to enjoy the area, attractions and beautiful beaches close by. Would go back to that hotel!","311":"For a 3 star the service is excellent and the rooms have excellent space, but as the hotel was on the corner of two busy streets at night the noise of cars honking and chattering makes it difficult to sleep well. Breakfast without an express machine, to be served at will, not accessible to guests, just that unbearable American coffee !! Super-attentive staff !!","312":"Hotel very well located, close to the center, with easy access to the main tourist points. At first glance the hotel appears to be very old, with an old facade and old reception, however, the room is very new and spacious. Modest breakfast, but with everything necessary. I highly recommend it!","313":"I liked the Hotel, a little used a lot, but still meeting the needs. Its location is out of town, but very good. It is in a seaside area and with excellent restaurants in the neighborhood. Breakfast in the Italian standard.","314":"On this trip to Italy I was hosted in 9 different places. In this one, without a doubt, I found a true gentleman, Mr Giuseppe. He came to welcome us in the courtyard, where we parked the car, helped with the bags, gave us all the attention and information about the city, restaurants, etc. The room was excellent, with two settings and well isolated from noise. Breakfast is hearty and of excellent quality. Being in Palermo I have no doubt where to stay. Attention: if you are arriving at the weekend, do not be alarmed by the restricted street, as local cars can drive. Grazie Guiseppe, arrivederci!","315":"We spent two days in Palermo, Sicily, and stayed at this excellent establishment. The owner is very attentive, serving with chivalry and dedication to all guests. In addition, it spontaneously provides several sightseeing tips, best restaurants and prices. It is always available. During our stay, we even prepared sandwiches for our return trip, since we were going to the airport before breakfast started. The accommodations are spacious, very well maintained and the breakfast, prepared by Marco (the owner) is good. Worth it.","316":"We were here in April 2014. Location very good, close to the port and the center of Trapani. Room very cozy and clean. Sweet breakfasts, but always fresh and delicious. The owner is very helpful, willing to advise what and where to buy, see and eat. Decent prices. We recommend !!!","317":"Very nice and clean rooms in the heart of the old town of Trapani - good value for money. An intimate atmosphere and Italian atmosphere. Very nice and competent reception staff - Lorena grazie mile per tutti! A big plus is also the free airport transfer, very nice and punctual driver.","318":"The apartment was clean and cleaned basically every day, once a week with change of towels and sheets, comfortable bed, kitchenette with gas stove and fridge. Bathroom clean, shower a bit tight. The bedroom was on the first floor on the mezzanine and the descent is quite breakneck. The surprise is the practical lack of windows, because what is difficult to define - rather a barrel. Sweet breakfasts plus fruit, yogurt, cereals and drinks. The staff uses English - some people get along better, but they can do it and are willing to help. Hassle-free transfer from to the airport. And the location in the middle of old Trapani, close to the port, fish market, bus stops and everything else. For globetrotters who do not expect luxury.","319":"A city hotel, very well located, in the heart of the old town of Trapani. Close to everything, yet quiet street and no noise. Bed linen, clean towels changed every 2 days. Nice helpful staff. Comfortable bathroom, warm water always. For families with small children no, but for adults who want to explore the city and its surroundings, I recommend Italian breakfasts, which means a lot of sweets, but you will choose something. Delicious coffee.","320":"I highly recommend this hotel. The apartment is identical to the pictures - spacious, clean, modern and equipped. Great contact with the manager from the very beginning. Very efficient booking, I immediately received confirmation of the transfer received. We were there after midnight - there was no problem with that. The manager was waiting for us with a smile - she gave us a lot of information about visiting Trapani and the surrounding area, sunbathing, excursions, shopping, bars and restaurants, getting around Trapani and parking places. Everything was perfect! Thank you for a great stay.","321":"The very good location of this apartment allows you to get to know the city itself from its inside as it is located in the very center of the baroque Trapani. Close (less than 10 minutes with a light walk) from here to the port from where ships depart for the Egadi Islands or for thematic cruises around this archipelago. In the evening, the city comes alive with many openings, and during the day it is pleasant here. The apartamernt I stayed in was of a very good standard. Air conditioning, internet, fridge, kitchenette, nice bathroom, spacious room and most importantly a MEGA COMFORTABLE BED !!! For those who want to spend their vacation in Trapani, it is a recommendable place :))) The owners will certainly rise to the occasion and treat each client individually! Another advantage of this apartemern and Trapani itself is the fact that with a good planning of your holiday you can see a lot here without renting a car, because the masto is well connected with other surrounding cities by a network of railways or buses. And in the above-mentioned port, the Egads are waiting for us :))"},"amenity_1":{"0":"Roof terrace","1":"Wifi","2":"Free parking","3":"Pool","4":"Breakfast available","6":"Breakfast
