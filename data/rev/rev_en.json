facilities in a spacious luxurious light, airy room right in the heart of Palermo. The modern, air-conditioned room is modern, fresh and excellent for a stay in the capital of Sicily, opposite a fantastic shop selling arancini.  The breakfast was plentiful & ample for starting a day of sightseeing. A great base to explore the hustle & bustle of this amazing city. The staff are attentive & extremely welcoming. I would definitely stay here on my next visit!","5":"This is a stunning place that is managed extremely well. The owner and the staff take very good care of their customers. Everything exceeds expectations: the whole set up is meticulously designed and decorated. It is spotlessly clean. The breakfast area is incredible and the morning spread is very good. The room exceeded our expectations and we regretted not staying more. It was spacious with a very comfortable bed and a sofa to relax. The bathroom area is also big with a very relaxing shower. We were able to drop our bags earlier than checkin allowed and leave them to explore the city more prior to our departure. Many places could learn from the level of customer service here!","8":"The booking was very uncomplicated and the communication with the hoteliers in advance was very good. We had also booked the airport transfer via the hotel, which also worked very well. Ok, it might have been a bit more expensive than by bus, but it was worth it, because we arrived quite late and were guided by the chauffeur directly into the B&B. The Delle Vittorie Luxury Rooms & Suites B&B is located in a side street of the Main Shopping Street right in the centre of the city of Palermo - so it's an ideal starting point for exploring the city. There are also many bars, restaurants and entertainment facilities in the area nearby. The room, which is divided into two by a room divider, was wonderfully large and very comfortably furnished. Also the bed was very comfortable and the room could be darkened well. But our absolute highlight was the disco-shower that was a lot of fun, not only after a heavy pub crash. :-) The breakfast was very good, too, always lovingly arranged and quite sufficient, although not very varied. Our special thanks go to Federica for the given tips for eating out, for excursions and other activities to do in Palermo. We can fully recommend the Delle Vittorie Luxury Rooms & Suites and would like to come back again, thank you!","10":"Coming from overseas, they video messaged us to help us find our way and saved us a parking spot on the street in front! The room was great, and the location is good for walking about with restaurants, shops and sights nearby. Breakfast had good variety and fresh orange juice.","11":"Very comfortable sparkling clean rooms with good showers. Awesome views of the Mediterranean to enjoy the Sunrise and Sunset. Breakfast was spectacular with very attentive friendly staff. The front desk staff was very helpful with guiding us with must see things in the short amount of time we had. Restaurants, bakeries and shopping area is close walking distance. Parking is bit of a challenge.","14":"This hotel is centrally located and has an accomodating and informative staff. The rooms are quite comfortable in every way, temperature, beds, space. Walk just minutes to fine restaurants and baroque spendor everywhere. Take an umbrella.","19":"The quiet and large rooms plus a very caring staff made our stay in Delle Vittorie a pleasure. It was a great location, but warning-Don't take your car into Palermo. After driving around the city, with 3 GPSs working for us, or rather against us, one of the staff was kind enough to come and fetch us. After that, we walked and took busses. The B&B was spotless, the rooms, comfortable and a nice breakfast, to boot.","20":"My wife and I stayed at the Residence La Gancia Hotel in Trapani. Beautiful hotel nice rooms pleasant staff. We had the room with the huge balcony overlooking the Tyrrhenien Sea. Walking distance to lots of resturants. Awesome old world atmosphere.","22":"We had a really nice stay at the B&B. The breakfast was very good. And the room was clean and comfortable. We had a warm welcome at the reception. And there was even a parking spot arranged for us. It's located in the middle of the city centre.","24":"The hotel is in an excellent location to walk around the centre of the city. The rooms are of a high standard, the staff extremely friendly and helpful and the roof top bar cafe for breakfast and evening drinks is awesome. There is also a roof top area to sun bath, magic. Cannot praise staff enough for their help. Definitely would stay here again.","26":"We stayed here for a few days in October, nice room, good breakfasts and excellent location. The staff are friendly and very helpful. Each evening you can visit the top floor breakfast room which turns into a bar where you can watch the sun going down and have a drink before dinner at one of the many restaurants in Trapani. With your drink the hotel provides a finger buffet of Sicilian specialties. Very nice.","29":"This was the first hotel of our trip and our only splurge as we wanted comfort and convenience to start us off. That being said, they earned a perfect rating. Check-in was easy and our room was incredible (307). It had an open floor plan with two rooms (bedroom and dining). The bathroom was large and very nice. You had to squint and look hard to find the aging or the uncared for parts. There were three windows, one facing the sea and old fish market square below, one facing the road we chose to park on (Lungomare Dante Alighieri), and the other facing the road that approaches the square (via Torrearsa). There was also a window in the bathroom. They all kept the street noise at a minimum. We didn\u2019t cook but it had a kitchenette. Two bottles of water per day for free in the mini-fridge (you can\u2019t drink the tap water). Solid wood floors. Hand painted tiles on the ceiling. Great WiFi. Breakfast was plentiful and lovely with the view of the sea and friendly service. The solarium was nice and open with showers. There was a gym we didn\u2019t use, of course. And despite advertising that no one is there beyond 8pm there was always someone there when we got back from dinner. Good recommendations, easy to follow directions, and they changed bills for coins for parking without a problem. Thank you!","30":"We stayed for two nights in one of the suites at the end of our holiday round Sicily. The location is perfect - in the middle of the city, close to all the sights and many restaurants. We easily walked from the bus station with our bags, and when we left we booked their excellent transfer service (with a lovely female driver who also talked to us about Sicily). Our room was superb, large and spacious to a very high standard, just like the photos. There were many nice gestures, like the welcome bottle of red wine, and our being able to enjoy panini and other items remaining from breakfast. Breakfasts were fresh, with lots of variety - cereals, pastries, yoghurts, boiled eggs, fresh fruit, panini etc, and we enjoyed the coffee made to order. Francesca, the co owner was terrific and so helpful throughout our stay. We would definitely stay here again.","32":"Stayed here for 5 nights as a base to see western Sicily. Rooms were great, the breakfast happyhour evening cafe bar on the top floor had spectacular views, and very reasonable prices. Good base for visiting Erice, Marsala, Segenta and the Egadi Islands. Trapani is a lovely town. The two best things about the hotel were the fact that you could swim in crystal clear waters 100m from the front door, and secondly the excellent helpful and knowledgable staff.","38":"The penthouse room (junior suite) exceeded our expectations, especially with the rooftop terrace, the gorgeous view (and the outdoor shower)! The staff was friendly and helpful. The breakfasts were excellentl. A big thank you to Giucy who was so warm and always aiming to please. Her English wasn't strong, and our Italian wasn't strong, yet we made ourselves understood, and she went out of her way to be of service. (And she makes a great cappuccino and negroni.) We loved our three nights in homebase Trapani -- a great location for day trips -- and we felt very at home in the neighborhood. What a great spot to come back to every night for our leisurely dinners and evening walks.","39":"This was the best property we stayed at during our trip to Sicily. The rooms are large in comparison to most with a very modern and spacious washroom. Being taller the showers in Europe tend to be an issue but this washroom would be more in line to North America. You could not ask for a better location you can walk anywhere from this hotel and its not that far from the train station (we walked it with suitcases) its also only a 4 min walk to the airport shuttle. The common areas of the B&B are very clean, modern and welcoming. The breakfast was absolutely perfect and the front desk lady was more then helpful. I am sorry I cant remember her name but from check-in to check-out she was so incredible. Amazing knowledge of the city and will help you with anything you need. There is absolutely nothing I can say negative about this property and if I ever find my self in Palermo again it would be no question where I stay. Thank you for making our final stop in Sicily PERFECT!","41":"The Residence La Gancia was a bit hard to find and we had to park on the street, but once inside it was blissful. The front desk staff was very friendly and helpful. They helped us negotiate paying the meter for the on street parking and assured us it would be fine to park there. They were right. The room was up to date and charming. We were on the front, so we had a view of the beach and the ocean. The bed was great and the amenities were very nice. They have a rooftop terrace where we had a drink both nights and where breakfast was served. It was an extensive and perfect breakfast buffet. Just watch out for the greedy seagulls. This was a really nice hotel and a perfect place to explore the seaport and the wonderful restaurants nearby.","43":"The B&B is inside an old building in one of the central area of Palermo. The rooms are completely renovated and very comfortable. The place is extremely clean and breakfast is really delicious. The only bad thing is that being so central at night is a little loud, because of all the bars and restaurants downstairs. If you like to enjoy the city and don\u2019t want to deal with transportation, this is an ideal place. Walkable distance pretty much to everything.","44":"We only had a brief stay in Messina but it was a great way to begin our trip around Sicily. The B&B is easily accessible from the ferry and close to the railway station. Fabio is a genial host. Breakast was enjoyable. Our room was very comfortable, with a balcony. A very refreshing stay. Good restaurants nearby.","45":"Another holiday in Trapani and another stay at La Gancia. A brilliant hotel in a brilliant location. Excellent breakfast on the roof top terrace which also doubles as a bar from 5.30pm.Great sea views. Wonderful staff who are extremely helpful.","47":"This B&B-hotel was chosen by us because it was rated 5 5 and after our visit I can confirm that it was exactly so! Most advisable! Clean and beautiful rooms and breakfast area, perfect location in the heart of the city, helpful and friendly staff...","49":"Great location with terrific rooftop sunsets. Relaxing Rooftop breakfasts . Lovely staff all very pleasant and helpful , English speaking. Clean relaxing place to stay . Shops and restaurants short walk away.","51":"My wife and I stayed in Room 7 (the suite). It was extremely spacious and comfortable, with all the necessary amenities. The location of the place is very convenient and safe. It is situated just off one of the main streets, where there are many shops and restaurants. Most of the main attractions in the city are also within 15 mins walking distance. The twin sisters Martina and Federica were very helpful in explaining where the main attractions were and how we could get there. They even had a list of recommended restaurants and cafes.  My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay, and would highly recommend Delle Vittorie to anyone traveling to Palermo. Don\u2019t be fooled by its B&B categorization. It could rival any boutique hotel.","52":"I stayed one night at the hotel. It has a good location close to the sea and to the city. The hotel was well kept. I had a good sized room with a bed, a desk and chair and a small table with two chairs. There were also two cooling plates, a microwave oven and a sink. The bed and the pillows were comfortable. The breakfast was good and served at the roof bar.","55":"on the sea in Trapani over looking the ancient city. a nice little boutique hotel. spacious and clean rooms. the roof top bar and restaurant have a great view of the coast. the staff at the hotel were so nice and helpful. the parking can be a little challenge if you come during the middle of the day on a weekend. it's in a really great location. once parked you can walk everywhere you want to see and eat in the area.","57":"Great hospitality, perfect location!! All the best attractions are walkable. A good restaurant is just downstairs of the building. The hist will arrange the pick up services if you request with reasonable price. My family loved this place!","59":"This was a great find using TA , it\u2019s a small well run hotel with helpful staff . We received two complementary drinks on arrival The breakfast is a reasonable \u20ac8 per person with great views of the city and there is a municipal parking near by for \u20ac2.50 per day It\u2019s central to many restaurants and the only comment is the rooms facing the front the hotel can be a little noisy with people Still would recommend this great little hotel","65":"What a wonderful find, everywhere very clean, comfortable bed, amazing breakfast. The hospitality was great especially from Martina and Federica, also must mention the cleaning staff they were always very friendly. This pleasant B&B would recommend without a doubt and would definitely stay again. Thank you","66":"If you're looking for a good location in Trapani, this is the place. On the sea-wall overlooking a small arcaded piazza and at the end of one of the main shopping streets, you are a short walk from a myriad of cafes, pizzerias, trattorias and most of the major historic buildings. The ferry port is five minutes away, the rail and bus stations rather further but still walkable.The building houses about 15 self-catering serviced rooms and is extremely pleasant and well- decorated and equipped. A major attraction is the roof terrace, which is open for breakfast and also during the evenings, for drinks and snacks; a most pleasant place to watch the sunset. There's also a fitness room and a small library. Staff are welcoming and helpful. Cleanliness is excellent. Rooms are a good size. The only niggle we had was that the self-catering facilities were a bit minimal. Nevertheless, a very good, very well-run establishment. Recommended.","71":"The location of La Gancia made it an excellent choice for the first part of our stay in Sicily. But it was made even better by Guisi. We must say Grazie Mille Guisi! Our stay at La Gancia was made so special thanks to you. You were friendly and welcoming on top of being attentive to our needs. You are a wonderful person and we will miss you. Highly recommend La Gancia for its location, its beauty, and of course for Guisi.","73":"b&b delle vittorie was a great choice for our trip to Palermo. The proprietor was communicative, helpful & accommodating, he even parked our car for us! The hotel is in a perfect location for exploring the old city, the accommodations charming and breakfast delicious. I definitely recommend staying here!?","78":"We had a fantastic time relaxing at La Gancia\u2019s bar. Giusi, our bartender, went out of her way to ensure our visit and our drinks matched the beauty that you can access \u2014a panoramic view of the Mediterranean bay and a quiet piaza down below. The bar area was impeccably clean and comfortable. Thank you Giusi for making our evening so special!","80":"This is the perfect venue in the heart of Palermo to easily access all the places of interest and to get a true insight into the history, culture and delicious food of this wonderful, easy to explore city. The room was very comfortable, spotlessly clean and the staff were super friendly and hospitable. Breakfast was plentiful and the tea, coffee and snacks available during the day and evening were a great touch. A special thank you to Martina who gave us excellent advice on where to go, how to get there and where to eat! Thank you for a perfect 3 night stay. We would certainly use Delle Vittorie as a base to explore the rest of Sicily in the future.","81":"Just stayed here for 3 nights and it was perfect. Check in was so easy and quick. We stayed in room 2 which has a sea view and balcony. The room was immaculately cleaned every day. Good breakfast. The owners were very nice and helpful , also a special thanks to Victoria for all her help. Close to shops and restaurants but no noise in room.We stayed here because of the good reviews and it was even better than we expected. Would definitely recommend and we would come back here next time in Messina.","84":"Went here last night as catching ferry next morning. The staff were lovely and despite the very noisy main road outside, I had a good nights\u2019 sleep. BUT, the room had no safe, no coffee making machine or kettle, and was a bit tired. The rug on the floor was dirty and the wall by my bed was filthy, in need of a good paint. Breakfast was enough, I had some cheese and ham and a pastry which was fresh, but think i have been spoilt by other places in Sicily where there was more choice and better quality of fruit and tomatoes, even cooked bacon and scrambled egg! Wouldn\u2019t recommend, have a shop around as there are plenty more places in the area","86":"My boyfriend and I stayed there for two nights and since we arrived everyone was extremely nice to us, very accommodating. From the check they gave us tips, arranged reservations to restaurants and parking.  But the one who made our stayed special was Giuisi, after we walk and needed refreshments we would go to the hotels terrace and she saw that we were on a romantic trip and go extra to set the ambience.  The rooms are big, including the bathroom. Everything is well kept and as I said the whole staff was amazing.  Thank you!!","89":"This B & B was right in the middle of downtown Palermo. When we arrived They gave us a completed Explanation of the layout of the city. They also gave us a list of restaurant recommendations. The rooms were comfortable.","90":"Stayed here for a few nights. Roof top is a great spot to relax and watch the sunset. Room was clean and spacious and the staff was excellent. The location is perfect to walk just about anywhere. Would definitely stay again.","92":"Stayed here for several night in October  The location is fabulous within walking distance to almost everything and Palermo.  This is a small boutique B&B hotel with six or seven rooms. We had a larger suite which provided additional space and was absolutely immaculate.  Pillow are very comfortable. It had a very large bathroom with a double basin sink  The staff are very friendly and helpful with getting us settle In and helping us plan our visit to Palermo.  There is a breakfast in the morning which was amazing.  The room we had , had these incredible blackout shades which rendered the room almost pitch black when they were down which was perfect for trying to get some rest.  Pros Location Room quality  Breakfast  Friendly staff  Cons. Wifi was very poor  non existent in our room but given we were on vacation that was probably a good thing. But otherwise it\u2019s readily available in the breakfast area Located just outside the rooms  Would highly recommend and stay here again","93":"Location was great and Fabio was an excellent host who went the extra mile in making stay comfortable. The room was nice and had a balcony, bed was comfortable, and the breakfast was superb. Would definitely recommend staying here.","96":"Wonderful modern B&B in the heart of downtown Palermo. Very convenient to shopping, restaurants and the sites of the historic district. Very helpful staff. Clean, chic room and bath. Nicely priced as well.","101":"The staff at Delle Vittorie really went above and beyond to make our stay great. Communication via what's app ahead of our arrival made things easy. They organized private parking for us nearby, which was very convenient as we wanted to leave our car while exploring the city the next day. The room itself was lovely, spacious and well appointed. The street was noisy, but we couldnt hear it in our room. Breakfast was nice as well, I only wish the setup for breakfast was a little quieter as it woke us very early. Before heading out the staff provided us with a map and list of top sites to see that matched the time we had to explore. We followed their recommendation and had a great day!","105":"Located just off Via del Liberty, which is the main shopping area of the city and route to all of the major sites. This second floor property is superbly managed and maintained. Although it is in the city center it is QUIET! I really appreciated the air conditioning as Palermo is rather warm and humid even in October. I was given fantastic advise to visit Montreal\u2019s, one of the most memorable sites of my visit to Sicily. Breakfast was available at 8:30 and snacks are available throughout the day and evening. My room was large with plenty of space to relax and reorganize prepare for my trip home.","109":"Nice room, very quite despite being close to everything . Lovely staff, a fair breakfast, great if you like sweets! Beautifully set up, with windows out looking the streets, lots of ppl around and close to a lot sights!","110":"Have just spent the night in this perfect bnb. The owner was charming, the place is spotlessly clean, the bed super comfy and the breakfast plentiful. It's a 10 minute walk from the train station. We arrived at night but still found the place easily enough.","111":"Considering that this is a four star hotel and the price point, Residence La Grancia is highly disappointing. The location is excellent and practical, the rest is regrettable. While the hotel is clean, it is certainly not beautiful. The bed was the most uncomfortable.","113":"Nice suite No 7. Very central and still extremely quite thanks to well isolated windows. Typical Sicilian breakfast with a lot of sweets. Friendly staff. Got a list of recommended restaurants nearby. Organized seemless airport pickup and transfer. Can absolutely recommend and will stay there again next time in Palermo.","116":"We enjoyed our cozy room, it was the perfect place for a one night stay. The staff was super friendly and accommodating. They gave us recommendations on what to do, where to eat and helped us park our vehicle. It is right near food, shopping and site seeing.","120":"The B and B was in a great location in Palermo. It was spotless and the staff helped me get taxis to and from the airport. They arranged special early check out and late check in. Easy access to 2nd floor and great dinner recommendation from them.","121":"great location, wonderful and helpful staff. And our room was excellent - wonderfully appointed, spacious, good storage both for clothes and in the bathroom. Highly recommend staying here.  Would request more savory choices at breakfast.","123":"We loved our stay in Trapani! The hotel was faultless- full of history, spotlessly clean, fabulous location and the breakfast balcony simply stunning!!! Service was very friendly and professional. We wish we stayed for longer.","124":"LocaTion was excellent. Staff recommended very good restaurants and made reservations for us. Breakfast could offer more variety but was good. Pickup and drop off at airport Was priced ok and was much appreciated. Hotel is clean and comfortable but not fancy. Room is a bit small. Still a good price for a great location.","127":"A great location in the centre of the City, close to all the main sites and restaurants.  The bedroom was well equipped and spacious and although our room fronted the road , there was no noise due to great triple glazing.  The staff were all very friendly and helpful","128":"Exemplary stay - from the moment we checked in, we were warmly welcomed, given great recommendations on where to park, restaurant recommendations and help with reservations, and even a towel to go to the free beach right outside the door. The welcome drink is a glass of Prosecco... Shower head can be adjusted to be a rain shower, and there is a good makeup mirror. Well equipped with good espresso machine and nice toiletries. The fantastic location near to the beach and on the main restaurant shopping strip, along with great client service akin to almost a concierge, makes this hotel a great place to stay - wholeheartedly recommend.","130":"We had a wonderful stay at the Delle Vittorie. Our room was very clean and comfortable with a very pleasing decor. Our room was quiet and Air conditioning worked well. Breakfast had all the usual Items, fruit, yogourt, eggs, cereal and most importantly the best Cannoli. The staff ( two twin sisters)were always very helpful and and pleasant to deal with. I really think you would be pleased with this property.","132":"We spent two nights here. A wonderful hotel. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The room was clean. We had a junior suite with terrace. We had our own private terrace with lounge chairs, umbrellas and tables. Our room also had a little kitchen area with a table and chairs. The hotel is located by the sea. There is a sandy beach behind the hotel. Walk along the boardwalk to the stairs down to the beach.The hotel is alo near all the restaurants and shops. A great place to stay","135":"Very pleased with our stay at Residence La Gancia. Easy walking distance to restaurants and nightlife, ferries, historical points. The staff here is excellent and goes above and beyond to make your stay comfortable.Our breakfast every morning at the rooftop dining area was superb as were the views and service. Same for our pre-dinner wine and spritzes on the rooftop. Parking is the only slight hassle. We dropped off our car as directed in the public 24 7 lot and it was a 5-10 min walk back to the hotel. Highly recommended!","138":"Clean, affordable, convenient and helpful friendly staff. Local sandy beach a stones throw away, restaurants, bars and access to port if going on excursions all less than a few minutes away. Local Taxi Marco bookable thru hotel. Vehicle clean and well maintained. Marco very helpful and willing to go that extra mile. Wonderful holiday","142":"We stayed one night in this beautiful hotel by the sea in Trapani. You can park your car nearby, in public parking with coins. The hotel is nice , our room had a great view over the sea. Breakfast is delicious and served in the terrace overlooking the sea. Highly recommended!!","144":"All around great hotel and location with exceptional breakfast. Very nice evening bar presentation and snacks. Hotel arranged for airport transportation that was nicely done. We would definitely stay here again.","146":"Looking out from our window you could swear you were in the sea ....we were that close. Very quiet and large rooms with Windows that open. You could lie on the bed and look out to sea. Great central location with lots of bars and restaurants within easy walking distance.  The bar on the top floor was great and we would have enjoyed sitting outside if it wasn't so unseasonably wet while we were there. This was also the breakfast room and they made a very good coffee. The staff were so friendly especially the lovely Giussi ! Can highly recommend this hotel as a great place to stay in Trapani.","148":"We had a very comfortable stay at Delle Vittorie. Rooms were clean and comfortable, the innkeepers were kind and helpful, and the breakfast buffet was fresh and plentiful. Good strong coffee is made to order. Location is central to almost all sights in Palermo.","150":"We spent one night at this fine boutique hotel in Trapani and quite frankly the pictures on the internet don\u2019t do it justice. The staff is very attentive and personable, wanting to make sure your stay is worry free and enjoyable.The bar and breakfast room is on the roof top with wonderful views, sofas and ample shade for those wishing to stay out of the sun. Our room overlooked the piazza. Parking was street parking by meter as described but this was no problem and in fact we could see our rental car from our room. When we checked in we were told that the rate for our room had dropped and gave us 2 complimentary breakfasts. The location is proximate to many restaurants and shops. Complimentary bottled water is provided as well.","151":"the twins were amazing from start to finish. Helpful when we arrived with parking, restaurant suggestions and information about the surrounding area. The apartment style hotel room was clean, updated and really cool, right in the middle of it all. I would stay again.","153":"Nice hotel, great location and view FromThe room. I don\u2019t give them 5 stars because they don\u2019t have parking. You can park on the street nearby . The view from The breakfast bar is also great. It is ay walking distance from all The important spots of the City","159":"This B&B is luxuriously appointed and has a great location just around the corner from one of the main pedestrian streets in Palermo. Just steps from major sites, restaurants and shops, it is the perfect location for visitors. The owner is very friendly and helpful. Transportation from the airport can also be arranged. The selection of pastries for breakfast was excellent.","162":"Behind a big wooden door- you enter a dark entry with an elevator from the year of the flood.. what you might expect from a Times Square hotel that charges by the hour.  But have faith- one floor up - there is another door to the B&B- and you enter another world. Modern- clean- comfortable room- excellent bath- and quiet considering you are in the center of Palermo . ( yards from the main walking street ) Nice buffet breakfast too. Only negative- hundreds of channels in Italian and not one in English- but who has time for TV. Ask Frederica anything before arrival or after- and it is done. Recommended","164":"The staff were so welcoming it made the stay a nicer experience. The location is perfect right in the historic area. The road outside the hotel was to be closed the next morning due to a run which was taking place so we had to park the car in a nearby car park. This was no hassle at all and took about 5 mins to walk back to the hotel. Breakfast was just ok nothing special but as we got a good deal this wasn\u2019t a problem. If asked would we recommend this hotel, the answer is yes, and would gladly stay there again if we were in the area.","166":"Selected this place based on reviews and it did not disappoint. Martina welcomed us and gave us the lay of the land; very centrally located, easy walk to all important sites. Clean, comfortable, and homey - including a wonderful breakfast. Definitely recommended.","168":"We loved this hotel! We found parking very easily by the hotel (free on the weekends and pay during the weekdays). The rooms are incredibly spacious with a large modern bathroom. The breakfast spread was delicious and the staff was so helpful with anything we asked them. I would highly recommend La Gancia.","173":"This is the perfect location for touring Palermo...just a few steps from the main pedestrian street of Via Maqueda. Room was spacious, well equipped and clean. Host was very helpful with tips and get oriented to Palermo.","175":"Our room included a kitchen and the bathroom was very large! The breakfast room has a lovely view of the sea and the selection of offerings was delightful. We spent 2 nights here during Easter week when the city is very busy due to its pageant which is impressive. We considered ourselves very lucky both to be in the town then and lodged in such a nice situation. The only negative was the caution not to drink the tap water but free bottled water was included in the room rate. Great Place!","176":"Very secure and lovely room. Great location. Perfect breakfast. Staff were very accommodating and prompt to assist us. In fact, when we decided to return a week later for another night before leaving Sicily they spent quite a lot of time finding another hotel for us as they were completely booked.","180":"The room was very nice and the location was fantastic if you want to see Palermo. It is right in the middle of everything. It is also right next to a great arancini and connoli place and also next to a great cocktail bar. Its a short walk to the opera house and cathedral and the markets. We drove so the parking is a little weird because there are parking restrictions in the city center that were a little confusing but we worked them out fine and the bnb explained everything to us. They were very helpful. Super nice staff!","184":"This boutique B&B was a delightful surprise. Located centrally for seeing many of the main religious buildings and bustling street cafes etc and within walking distance of the main coach and train station. The spacious rooms are modern and well equipped with tea coffee making facilities, hairdryer, bath slippers and luxury white fluffy bath and hand towels. Electrically operated exterior blinds on the bedroom windows ensure both privacy and added sound proofing for a great nights sleep. Breakfast is provided in the smart breakfast room and consists of cold meats and cheese, cereals, fruit, yoghurt, savoury pastries, boiled eggs and sandwiches. A range of teas, coffee and fruit juices are also available. The staff are very very pleasant and helpful, Federica especially made herself known to us at breakfast on the first day. When I asked about gluten free food I was delighted to be presented with my own gluten free sliced white loaf and a plate of sweet breakfast cakes and biscuits. Very much appreciated. Housekeeping is efficient and unobtrusive I wholeheartedly recommend this boutique B&B for anyone wanting a memorable stay in Palermo.","190":"The quality of the accommodation and the service provided at the Delle Vittorie is very, very good. The bedroom is well appointed, with good quality furnishings. The breakfast room, is ideal, and provides a wide range of items \u2013 all very nicely presented and of good quality. The location of the hotel is ideal, and is within a 1 minute walk of Via Maqueda, so all visitor attractions are within easy reach. Additionally, it is a very safe area of the city. We had a most enjoyable stay, only 2 nights, but we would return, and we highly recommend it.","191":"The room is clean, well sized, and well equiped..the responsible officier welcomed us and provided us with the advise about places to visit ...he gave us maps and train and buses routes to places to visit . The breakfeast is closy and gives u a family meaning ...the location is perfect facing the city centre...actually its the city center..the places to visit include tormina and cournish","193":"This B and B is in the heart of Palermo and located in the pedestrian area. All the sites are a short walk away. The rooms are comfortable and clean and well appointed. The staff is very helpful and accommodating. Highly recommend this for a short stay.","199":"Excellent property, in a wonderful location. Staff very helpful and knowledgable of their city. Comfortable beds, spotless rooms, and a great selection of local foods at breakfast. A great base to explore Palermo.","202":"The outside of the building gives no clue as to the modern, clean and welcoming interior. From organising our airport transfer to leaving the accommodation after a great four night stay, nothing was too much trouble for Federica and Martina who were always friendly, smiling and keen to offer assistance. Breakfast every morning was fresh and varied with the buffet featuring delicious local produce. Our room was quiet, comfortable and well-proportioned. This boutique residence is perfectly located for sightseeing and a multitude of good, local restaurants and bars. We had a great time and look forward to returning.","205":"Throughly enjoyed our stay at Delle Vittorie The staff couldn\u2019t do enough to help and ensure you have a pleasant stay The B&B is not manned full time but you have key access to the building ,B&B and room . You feel safe and relaxed , it is in a perfect central location with plenty to see and do . Noise level from the streets is zero behind your double glazed room. There is tea making facilities and stocked mini fridge in the rooms. Clean ,bright and modern rooms with fresh bedding and towels ,slippers ,en-suite excellent hot shower . The twins who manage the B&B are wonderful , the housekeeping staff amazing . Breakfast buffet with fresh pastries , cereals ,fruit ,bread , coffee and fresh juice is served in a perfect little dining area. We so enjoyed our stay and will certainly recommend to others. We hope to return next year with a plan to explore Sicily further Thank you for a wonderful welcoming stressfree stay","208":"We had a wonderful stay a few weeks ago, lovely hidden away suites, very clean and tidy with wonderful, friendly and welcoming staff who did everything to make our stay pleasant. Especially the organising of the tour bus to the beach. We also enjoyed the cocktail bar below! We would definitely recommend the stay here, so close to the heart of Palermo.","211":"The Delle Vittorie far exceeded our expectations. Upon entering the fortress like front door, to riding up in the charming, old fashioned, caged elevator, you enter the suite of beautifully appointed guest rooms which were clean, spacious and provided you with all amenities including slippers. The bed and breakfast puts out a wonderful breakfast selection each morning which includes Italian specialty sandwiches, cold cuts, olives and peppers, fresh, mouth watering pastries, fruits of all varieties and warm, crusty breads and croissants, cereal and yogurt. Something delicious for everyone! There are also fresh squeezed juices and Italian and American coffee. In the afternoon and evenings, they leave out water and juices and some wine and Limoncello. What makes this bed and breakfast special is the warm, friendly and very helpful staff who work here. They all went out of their way to make us feel at home. They offered advice on what sites to do that were walking distance and helped to plan excursions which were a little further away such as Monreale and Cefalu. In addition, the location is right in the heart of restaurants, bars, pastry shops, gift shops and walking distance to Teatro Massimo, Four Corners and numerous churches.Our room looked out onto the main thoroughfare and it was so quiet! I highly recommend staying here and look forward to our return visit in the future! We loved Palermo and the Delle Vittorie! Thank you for a wonderful stay!","213":"We Loved the Delle Vittorie! A bit of a challenge driving to, but a beautiful reward once arrived. Lively area right in middle of Palermo yet quiet and serene rooms. Beautifully decorated and nicely appointed rooms. Our room overlooked a Very Cool restaurant bar that featured great live music...only heard if you went down to or opened breakfast room windows. We wouldn\u2019t hesitate returning to the Delle Vittorie!","216":"Delle Vittorie is a lovely establishment providing quality B&B style of accommodation. It ticked all the boxes. The room that we stayed in was very clean and well appointed with a very comfortable king sized bed. The room was very quiet, there was a complimentary bottle of wine and bottled water in our room. The shower had plenty of hot water. It is also very well located to walk to all the main sights that Palermo has to offer including the markets, theatres, cathedral, shopping and palaces and is not far away from the ferry port (about a 10 Euro taxi ride) or the main train station (15 minute walk). There are also plenty of high quality restaurants nearby ranging from gelaterias, pizzerias and cafes to high quality restaurants. The breakfast was outstanding with a wide range of Sicilian specialities as well lovely fresh fruit and usual standards for those who prefer a less exotic breakfast.  The thing that was most important for us was the really friendly reception we received from Martina and her commitment to really looking after her guests. My wife and I had the misfortune to leave our passports in the safe and we were well on our way to catch a ferry in Milazzo when Martina contacted me to tell me about our passports. Martina kept them safe for us and arranged a transfer for us when got back to Palermo so that we didn't miss our ferry which would have really disrupted our holiday. We can't thank Martina enough. My wife and I had a great stay and would definitely stay at Delle Vittorie again.","221":"My husband and I enjoyed everything about this hotel. Easy to get to from the airport shuttle, great informative check-in, comfortable room with everything we could need, and delightful breakfast. There was even soymilk for the morning after mentioning I was vegan. Will be back!","222":"The B&B was everything we were after, great location, very clean and nice rooms.  The service was second to none and the staff were all so helpful, and went above and beyond to help us whilst we were in the city.","239":"This property is very nice and is in a really central location. We were greeted with a warm welcome and genuine care. Martina went out of her way to help us with our (many) bags and to ensure we were safely parked. She also gave us a great intro to the city with recommendations of what to visit and where to eat. The hotel graciously gave us an upgrade, which was much appreciated. And did I mention the breakfast? Outstanding! We would definitely come back here!","244":"The room was clean, very modern, and extremely comfortable. The staff was extremely helpful and friendly. The continental breakfast was delightful and was served with a great deal of professionalism. I would recommend this bed-and-breakfast to anyone who needs a simple room with great comfort.","247":"The accomodation was great, good location, furnishing elegant, staff friendly. Price good. I definitely suggest the place. No problem with late or early check in check out. Good location also in respect of airport shuttle bus stop.","249":"We loved our stay at Delle Vittorie! Giuseppe the owner was a pleasure to deal with! So helpful and a gracious host. The boutique style of the hotel is lovely with a modern and contemporary decor and the rooms were exceptionally clean. The breakfast was a classic continental.  The location was perfect to get around and easy walking distance to the markets, restaurants, shopping etc with some amazing cocktail bars right on the door step. The arancine place right outside is well worth a visit.  Would recommend a visit!","254":"I wish I had a room in my home to redecorate! I would make it look just like our suite. The room has charm and elegance. The breakfast area is cheery and a little area is in the B & B where one can read in a quiet place. There was a complete breakfast choice and when we arrived late, the keys were on the door for our entry. Martina was very helpful in acquainting us to the city.","258":"Wonderful B&B. Rooms are spacious and very clean. All the staff are very helpful and accommodating especially Martina. The location is ideal as it\u2019s walking distance to everything. Breakfast is very good and refreshments are available throughout the day.","273":"Do hoteliers not understand how important wifi is today. To advertise it and provide a very, very poor reception is unforgivable.  If, like me, you are a traveller and require a reasonable wifi connection then do not book here.","284":"After late ferry we choose this hotel, because we fell in traffic jam trying to get out of Messina and stayed here to avoid that. Really friendly and kind woman at reception checked in us, room was basic but clean. Breakfast was so poor, and that few things that they offering were tasteless. So disappointing. We left hungry. And hotel is expensive because for that price they should offering more.","288":"In Jun July 2019, a tragedy occurred in my life and had to find a way to move forward and a place to stay while I took care of my things as I needed to leave my home due to a terrible situation.  I booked myself into Casena Dei Coli, a place I had wonderful memories from, so I thought, I\u2019ll go there to feel safe while my life was falling apart. With a minor issue during ordering, which wasn\u2019t their fault, they helped me get a room, one that I almost lost due to this mistake of online booking through a third party.  Deborah who was handling the situation was an angel, like many that week, so many wonderful people came to my rescue, hidden angels all teamed up and showed me what a wonderful soul so many had in my most desperate hour. From Deborah the receptionist to the manager, to the kitchen staff, they were all incredibly supportive and kind, it brings a tear to my eye how wonderful they were with me.  Attentive and understanding of what I was going through, they took good care of me. I cannot recommend this place highly enough, it is a perfect little heaven, hidden from the rest of their surroundings. With wonderful room service, amazing breakfast with delicious items to enjoy, they gave me an incredibly safe and happy environment to pull through during my tragedy. I will forever consider them part of my most precious memories from Palermo.  Everyone was beyond helpful and beyond perfect in their care for me and the hotel is amazing. I\u2019ve been there many times and I will return again and again. I\u2019ll send friends there and I\u2019ll bring whoever I\u2019ll travel with there as well. I know I praise them a lot, but I don\u2019t do this just because\u2026  I\u2019m not paid to say any of this, I am speaking from my own experience and their service and professionalism was beyond perfect\u2026 they are a true hidden gem in Palermo\u2026 utterly kind, utterly professional and my stay there was healing. Thank you to Deborah, to the manager that day, to the kind dude who helped me out after work\u2026 Because of you all, and so many in that week, I got out safely and with so many helping souls who I now call dear and close friends.  My highest recommendation goes to the staff and this hotel for being so professional and going out of their way to make me comfortable and offering care and assistance in my time of need.  I\u2019ll be seeing you all again shortly when I come back visiting.  Have a happy New Year and a successful one!  Gracie mille amici :heart:","309":"Nice hotel, clean. Good value for the price. Really recommend this place for a week end away. The staff was very helpful especially the nice friendly lady at the reception who has given us good recommendations and advice on buses and how to travel around without a car. Grazie per tutto :slightly_smiling_face:","313":"Hotel is somewhat tired and, although the Best Western signs were still up, has I believe been disenfranchised by Best Western because their standards were not being met. The staff are disinterested and one barman was just plain rude! The restaurant was atrocious because the staff and chefs were toadying up to the local police, who used the restaurant quite frequently, to the detriment of any other customers or hotel guests. Avoid like the plague!","318":"Really nice hotel and excellent, very helpful and polite staff. Rooms are spotless and cleaned every day. Food very good especially breakfast. Drinks expensive but a nice little place less than 200 mts down the road.","321":"Stayed here yesterday. Reception people were great. Room was very clean. Breakfast was ok, coffee was ok, croissants were very good (with choco cream). Hotel is a little old but still ok. Good for a short stay.","341":"First the positives. This hotel provides large, modern rooms with excellent bathrooms. There is free parking and breakfasts are OK Now the negatives. It is very difficult to get into and out of Palermo. If you have your own car you can risk it but the city is so crowded that parking is a nightmare. Public bus services are very poor. You can wait forever without one ever making an appearance and that\u2019s after the 1.5k walk to the bus stop. The only sensible option is a taxi which costs about 16 \u20ac to the centre of the city. An expensive round trip. The junior members of staff are helpful but the reception desk was useless. We had to ask them if they were there to help us or not they were so obdurate when we made simple requests. Throughout our stay they failed to provide us with a card to switch on the power to our room. Instead I was obliged to switch on the power via the main distribution box. The safe never worked. The hotel is surrounded by low rise flats and the area is severely lacking in amenities. There was a takeaway pizza and bar at the end of the street but the first worthwhile restaurant more than a kilometre away. In short, the hotel is an average base for business users. It hopeless for those on vacation, especially with children.","355":"This hotel is more three then four stars but the good choice if you want to stay in Messina for several nights. Parking is available on site and it is free and safe. Large rooms and bathrooms. Nice view over the sea. Breakfast is included. Wi-Fi is available and free. Staff is friendly.","369":"Breakfast was fair. Rooms were basic. Very noisy and rooms were hit. Staff were not nice and very rude. Refused to help. Iv stayed in different hotels in the area and this is the worst. I will not be returning to this hotel.","372":"Stayed a week ago. The male staff are nasty! Do not help. I will not stay again. Must better places around. They have issues with rooms and noise and cannot handle complaints. They are just rude. Staff elsewhere","378":"A very enjoyable stay. The whole staff at this hotel was very hospitable and accommodating, especially Maria who works at the front desk. Everyone was extremely polite and willing to help no matter what time of the day it was. The hotel was very clean and they had a sufficient breakfast buffet every morning. Conveniently located in Messina - would highly recommend when going to visit the area.","393":"We have toured the world and stayed in numerous types of accommodation. This place is by far the worst. From check in to check out - our treatment from the staff here was disgusting! I\u2019ve seen dogs in a shelter treated better than here. The only people that get nice treatment are the locals! On first glance the hotel looks ok - its the staff and facilities that are the problem. The air conditioning didn\u2019t work in our room - we reported the problem several times. I had the phone put down on me and I was blamed for it not working. Went to reception and were accused of being liars. I am heavily pregnant and they expected me to stay in a room that was nearly exceeding 40degrees without air con. My husband demanded another room after being shouted at in reception in front of other guests! We were given another room and the air con was still terrible. We were still awake at 2am due to loud music being played in and out of the hotel. Went back down to reception to complain - greeted by another bout of unfriendliness and attitude. We should have stayed there 5 days and we checked out the next day. We didn\u2019t get anymore than 3hours sleep. They have refused to refund us any money. If you want treating badly then this is the place for you. I wish I could award no stars. They are absolute con artists! They have ruined our holiday as we are massively out of pocket as we have had to find and fund another hotel ourselves. DO NOT STAY HERE!!!!!","402":"Located not in the centre it is anyway a cheap accomodation and with a good breakfast. So a solution to consider if you have the car. There are several block around a j\u00eckind of square and the room are quite basic but clean.","420":"My two-night stay here was wonderful. The room was spacious and modern with good WiFi and a nice large balcony. The courtyard is very relaxing with bar staffed by a friendly bartender and open late. Location is quiet but very close to lots of restaurants, cafes and Teatro de Verdura. The best part of the stay was the welcoming and professional staff. Owner Josephine was a marvelous host and provided attention to all our needs day and night with a smile and enthusiasm. Reception was very pleasant and helpful as well, especially Deborah, who always greeted us with a pleasant attitude and professionalism. I look forward to staying hear next time I visit Palermo and highly recommend it.","421":"This is an average rank hotel in an unattractive area of the city. The rooms and service are OK and so is breakfast. The rooms are quite comfortable and clean. All in all - an acceptable experience. Many organized groups use this hotel for a stop-over and probably because it is cheap. There are not enough elevators if there is a large number of visitors at a time1","437":"The hotel is on the airport side of Palermo so you do not have to risk the traffic to get there just the one way system. Arriving we found a parking spot but needed to help one of the maids extricate her car for which we're gratefully thanked. This resulted in a very positive reception from all the other staff which made our stay so very pleasant. The rooms are clean and cool ,which with 36*c was essential. The breakfast buffet on the first day was as good as I have had. The variety of croissants and fresh fruit. The second day we were slightly later and the selection was not so good. Still acceptable.","444":"We spent 2 nights in the hotel. It is a perfect accomodation for those who prefer modern, clean and peaceful rooms. The parking is free, the historical downtown is easly accessible by bus. The nearby PizziCotto Restaurant is perfect for dinner. The breakfast is good. The staff is helpful \u00e9s friendly. I highly recommend the hotel for romantic, business and family trips as well.","460":"I stayed here with my daughter 1st June - 4th June 2019 a lovely setting with its gardens ... Rooms are spacious and well maintained ...the bed and pillows are comfy. The whole hotel is spotless and the staff work very hard to keep it like this. We enjoyed our stay here and the weather was a bonus Thank you","463":"The hotel is located right on the waterfront, just across the harbor. It's nice to sip your morning coffee on the 7th floor breakfast terrace while watching the ferries moving in and out. The location is great not only because of the scenic view: the main attractions of this fabulous city, including Teatro Massimo and Fontana Pretoria, are walking distance away. Although there's no gym room, the hotel's staircase walls are painted in an attractive way to encourage the guests to climb the stairs instead of taking the elevators. However, the hotel's theme seems to be graffiti, to match the neighborhood \u2013 old buildings, some of them decayed and covered in interesting and funny graffiti. Stayed in a room located at the 4th floor, over viewing the mountain and the old neighborhood mentioned above. The concierge staff is particularly kind and helpful. Free city maps are available for free at the reception desk. The breakfast is decent. I also took some meals in the hotel's restaurant and I found the food savory and tasty, although not much fancy looking. All in all, a good accommodation option in Palermo, offering a good value for money.","467":"I have experienced several problems with my hotel reservation but the hotel manager is unwilling to help. That has been a big disappointment. So I would never book this hotel again as they don\u2019t value their customers based on my experience.","471":"Signora Beatrice is a kind woman who loves her city and its history but also a person who really take good care of her customers. Although we couldn\u2019t communicate perfectly in english she provided me with her best service and she also informed me on central sicily\u2019s history and its main industry which is sulphur mining.  The hotel room was really spacious with separate shower and toilet spaces. Bed was comfortable and overall the room was well kept. The only drawback is that is not very lit as the hotel is situated in a very narrow street in a densely populated neighborhood.Breakfast is ok and served in the ground floor next to reception.  If you wanna feel like home in Caltanisetta, I recommend you to stay in this place!","481":"Smallest and ugliest room I have ever stayed in. I arrived late at night and I left first thing the next morning as it was so awful. I booked a different hotel for the remainder of my stay. The window opened straight onto an office building window so the curtain had to remain closed. Very minimal ammenities.","503":"Stayed here for a quick Winter break. Although the surrounding area may not be the best Palermo has to offer, I cannot fault the hotel. Staff were friendly, and very helpful and accommodating. Patient with attempts at Italian! The room was huge with a walk in shower en-suite and with a huge 2 person bathtub in the actual bedroom. A bit quirky but very different. Breakfast room on the 7th floor overlooks the harbour, and you can watch ferries and cruise liners as you take breakfast. Breakfast itself was excellent with great variety and plenty of fresh fruit. Really good coffee to. Other than the area (night time returns you do run a gauntlet currently through building works close by that is used by homeless at night time so be careful) Staff were so helpful and were genuinely interested in your trip and in the hotel service. Recommended.","505":"My husband, daughter and I stayed here for two nights last summer. I chose the location of Caltanisetta because it was midway between the towns of Santa Caterina and Castrofilippo, which is where three of my grandparents were born and raised before emigrating to the U.S. Beatrice, the owner, was curious as to why we chose to visit this part of Sicily. When I explained, with the help of one of her bi-lingual employees, that I wished to visit the streets where my grandparents lived and find out more about my ancestors, she graciously volunteered to drive us to the Registry office in the center of town so we could find out more. So along with another bi-lingual staff member who acted as translator, we did just that! So, yes, the rooms are not fancy and yes, this is definitely more a B&B than a hotel, and yes, this is not a traditionally touristy part of Sicily (we were the only non-Italians staying there at the time), I will never forget the kindness of Beatrice and her staff in their unasked for assistance in my genealogy search. I highly recommend the Antichi Ricordi!","509":"We were recommended this place by a well known UK travel site. Nothing spectacular & in fact, perhaps a bit amateurish but clean & spacious. They have converted some old buildings. My only gripe was that the rooms were not bright. Good location & the staff are very nice. A bit over-priced for the location. We left after one night.","523":"We spent five nights here when touring Sicily. It is a small hotel opposite harbor. There is nothing romantic about it and feels like a business hotel. Its location is within easy walk of restaurants and bars and twenty minutes or so walk from the historic center. Rooms are functional, clean and with standard three   four star amenities. There is no swimming pool but there is a free car-park. Breakfast is adequate for this type of hotel. Staff if helpful and polite.","526":"I hate to say this because the staff was so kind and friendly but this place was not what we expected from the description and photos posted. It just wasn't as nice as they represent it to be. We had trouble finding it due to it's slightly hidden location, up steps from a side street and parking wasn't easy either. The woman at the front desk, actually got into our car and helped us find parking which was shockingly so kind of her. The room itself is very clean and updated. I wouldn't call this place a hotel but rather a Bed and breakfast.","529":"The location, very pleasant and helpful desk staff, clean spacious room, great housekeeping staff and on-site parking make floors 1-6 a 5 for 5 experience. Floor 7, the restaurant, does the damage to the overall rating. Being tired the 1st night of or 5 night stay, we wimped out and decided to eat dinner in the hotel. The meal was one of the most mediocre (might be an overrating?) I have experienced in Italy (25 years living and traveling). Steer clear of the dinners. The breakfast buffet was much better. A good expanded selection of all the normal breakfast offerings and they did get the scrambled eggs right (normally SE on a buffet are dry and overcooked). But being understaffed the buffet was not replenished in a timely fashion nor were that tables cleared to make way for the newly arrived. The dining room staff did the best the could but the size of the room and buffet warrant 2 additional staff members. The saving grace of the 7th floor is the balcony overlooking the ferry harbor. Fascinating fun watching all the arrivals and departures and enjoying a drink or coffee after having had dinner elsewhere.","552":"Clean hotel, old building with small rooms and small beds (140). The hotel is just a little to far from the center. Breakfast was great with a nice view from the 7th floor and the staff was very friendly.","554":"Up a little side street in central Caltanissetta, this hotel is well worth the visit. It\u2019s simple, but very welcoming. The rooms have been renovated with a lot of taste. The breakfast is typical of a three star hotel. The staff are a delight and very knowledgeable about the local area. Definitely the best place to stay in central Caltanissatta.","562":"Lovely hotel, huge rooms, huge beds and lovely bathroom. Hotel view to port. Double windows in rooms so no noise at all. Breakfast was on 7th floor with terrace, nice view also. Free parking area. Spent 2 nights there. Easy and fast check-in and check-out.","569":"Fabulous views from the 7th floor restaurant over the port. Food very good both at breakfast and dinner. Very good value for money. Staff really helpful on reception. A good 15 minute walk to main sights. I would recommend this hotel .","582":"The staff were very helpfull. Fine room with a very fine bathroom. The restaurant and bar on the 7th floor, with a fine look to the harbour and the sea. Breakfast was very fine, but I missed a little more meat on the buffet in the evening","586":"The Palazzo Brunaccini hotel is an excellent and recommended hotel.\r Located close to the Ballaro ancient market in the ancient part of Palermo.\r The hotel's great location that is very close to old Palermo\u2019s tourist sites, making it possible to go hiking   walking to the most important tourist sites (as my wife and me have done).\r The hotel itself is located in a newly renovated building that looks amazing.\r Amazing interior design and plenty of sculptures, pictures and furniture that looks like taken from a museum.\r The staff were great, execelent service, advice and help on any topic we needed. Mainly the very late-night shuttle to the airport.\r The room itself was excellent, the shower room was spacious and well-equipped.\r BUT the BIGGEST surprise was a Double Jacuzzi bath, an amazing surprise and a GREAT Pleasure.","593":"We didn't actually stay here but we visited twice as our nearby B&B had arranged for us to have our breakfasts here. The hotel is near to Chiesa del Gesu in a quiet little square and it is very nicely decorated and the staff were very friendly and welcoming. The breakfast choice was huge so you would find lots to enjoy - hot, cold, sweet, savoury and lots of homemade pastries. On the first day we were able to eat outside in a lovely courtyard but not the next day due to overnight rain - inside was a nice environment too though. Having now visited, we would definitely consider staying here another time as it's a good central location.","599":"We had a very pleasant stay at the Palazzo Brunaccini on our last night in Sicily. Our room was very spacious with a seating and dining area separate from the bed area. The staff were very nice and helpful. The breakfast was a bit disappointing with not many choices for those who don't eat a lot of pastries. That could be because we were visiting off season. The neighborhood appears a bit sketchy so we were just conscious of this.","600":"My wife and I stayed here for 2 nights during our stay in Palermo. The hotel is a 15-20 minute walk from most of the main sights and a half an hour walk from the train station. If you can manage, walk to the station as a taxi could set you back \u20ac20. The reception staff were lovely and very knowledgeable. The room was basic but clean. The pictures on the website do not represent the actual room. Our room was quite updated and looked nothing like the pictures;however, it does appear that parts of the hotel have been refurbished, namely the reception and breakfast areas). Breakfast was included and there was a selection of ham,cheese, fruit and cereal. Certainly enough to start your day. Although the hotel has no straws, they seem to be quite heavy on plastic use. Plastic cups instead of glass at breakfast and polystyrene cups in the room-not very good for the environment. Overall,the hotel is fine for a couple of nights in Palermo.","603":"Excellent cost benefit, good and convenient location, room is big, comfortable and quite with a nice view of the port, bathroom clean and spacious. Breakfast is very good! I do recommend Hotel ibis Styles Palermo President!","609":"We stayed here twice in the same week, visiting the island of Ustica in between. So, having seen two different rooms, it's safe to say you've got to be somewhat lucky on that front.\r \r The rooftop rooms are spacious, and truly quite nice bar the fact that they have nearly no window   sunlight of any kind. Very depressing after a while (oh, and you can forget reliable WiFi in this place). On top of that, it was a crying shame that the airco decided to spew out a pile of crap all over our bed when we turned it on. Cause it was late at night, no one was available to clean things up. We then asked for a vacuum cleaner and we'd do it ourselves, but the person on duty had no access to one, so instead of going to bed, we spent 20 minutes cleaning our own bedding, the floor around the bed, etc from a pile of nasty black moldy dust that probably come out of some airco pipe. It went everywhere, and it was absolutely revolting.\r \r The next room we had (we prebooked both visits so no way to cancel anymore...) was smaller, but we didn't feel so trapped and at least it was clean, without mishaps.\r \r Outside of the hotel, the neighbourhood isn't anything to write home about. In fact, it feels borderline unsafe. Then again, so does perhaps much of the rest of Palermo. It's not that much of a walk to anything though so for the price, probably ok?\r \r Shame we had the above happen, cause had one of the best spaghetti dishes ever in their restaurant. Supremely tasteful and simple, with fresh ingredients.","628":"The property itself is beautiful and looks like a renovated old family estate house. The quality of the rooms is fine and the service was above average. The only downside of the hotel is the location is somewhat unsafe at night. It is the nicest hotel in downtown Palermo and conveniently within walking distance to the major tourist attractions. However, I removed all jewelry while staying at this property and would not walk around at night by myself.","630":"A bit difficult to find by car but then you are right in the middle of down town, the challenge was to get the heavy luggage from the first floor to the next one without elevator but the room was nice and quite \u201cunnoisy\u201d for such a city location. The restaurant is terrific","636":"Our taxi driver had difficulty navigating to this small hotel tucked away on a small piazza in the old part of Palermo. But once there, we realized what a great choice we made. A converted palazzo, the hotel still had some of the feel of a former grand private residence. The staff were extremely friendly. Our room was spacious with very high ceilings and a comfortable seating area (with huge windows looking onto the piazza). Great location allowed for walking everywhere (which is good, because you cannot easily grab a taxi from the hotel). Just make sure to have a good map navigation app on your phone. And breakfast every morning in the outdoor courtyard was supremely peaceful, with a very nice buffet.","645":"Stayed hear for 7 nights in august nice hotel in a great location.\r All staff very nice room was lovely and quite big.\r So if you are looking for a nice hotel in Palermo don't just look book you won't be disappointed trust me","651":"This is a very good 3 star hotel, sadly wannabe 4 star which it isnt.\r Firstly, arrived for the weekend to celebrate my bday...staff didnt even acknowledged yet it was clear from passport details.\r We took bus from airport and walked from via Roma stop...the hotel was about 10 mins walk, not easy nor difficult to find with sat nav. We arrived from the church library end.\r Check in was easy and our room was ready early which was very good.\r Room allocated was on 2nd floor, but no fully accessible by lift...no help with luggage offered.\r The room was a far cry from boutique style that's for sure. Large with a sky chalet style ceiling and one small window facing some courtyard and houses.\r Old hard bed, two ugly armchairs and table and 2 cheap leather alike chairs.\r Bathroom decent size, no windows and very poor light.\r Not even a free bottle of water provided for arrival. Large mini bar fridge in the room tho.\r Bathroom amenities were good and a good selection of toiletries provided. Small shower cubicle with a rod for clothes hanging. Water pressure just about tolerable.\r A c in the room took about half a day to cool the room down but worked well and wasnt very noisy.\r Only had breakfast once during our stay\r . Didnt bother the second day as nothing to get down for. Very poor selection, tiny portions, nothing left and not replaced quickly enough. Free coffee was frankly disgusting but pay extra and can get Italian Expresso etc...this is not good enough for 4 stars.\r Paid extra for bottle of prosecco on my bday morning..@\u20ac20 it was a rip off but didnt care much. Apparently there is an option of some cooked eggs for extra but again we wouldn't know as breakfast staff didnt say a word. One lady was nice and smiles. The guy was grumpy and shouldn't work in hospitality.\r So breakfast a big thump down from us, hence didnt bother second day.\r This leaves me with the final point of review which is the location...awful! In the middle of stinky and dirty part of palermo with creatures lurking around at day and drug dealers at night. The hotel itself doesn't provide any amenities to relax such as roof top terrace or shaded area but frankly I wouldn't want to look at the area as it was awful. Centrally located yes but not good enough for us. Hotel door permanently locked, day and night says it all.\r We made the most of our stay but would absolutely not return back here nor would we recommend the hotel.\r How was your stay is a standard question I expect to be asked at good hotels around the world these days....sadly this one didnt bother. Enough said.","653":"we stayed two nights here .Didn't find the staff overly engaging, but pleasant enough and offered us a take out breakfast for an early check out which was nice. the room was lovely and the bathroom modern and clean.\r some lovely quirky details in shared spaces.\r the issue we had was around security.it didn't feel overly safe when leaving the hotel to walk around the neighborhood. there were several home;less people sleeping outside and loitering.\r it is a multi cultural neighbourhood, but we felt uneasy.","672":"Wonderful hotel in Palermo in a city struggling with hotel quality\r 50 metres to brilliant street market\r Easy walking to major attractions including the sublime Capella Palatino\r Great rooms and common areas","673":"Very good hotel,clean rooms and helpful staff. Everyday the reception was full of customers waiting to be informed and the three girls working there, were extremely kind. I dont remember their names.All I know we had a problem with our suitcase due to our fault we didnt take ours but another suitcase at the bus station. The girls helped at once called the station and we took at last our suitcase.Not to mention about the information they gave us for restaurants and excursions. Well done girls..Thank you for everything.Kisses from Greece and Grace","682":"My travel agent booked this hotel and I was not looking forward to it after reading other reviews. I figured she wouldn't send me to some place that wasn't safe, especially after I vocalized my concerns about safety. We did end up walking to Ballaro Market but made sure all our walking was done before dark. I was so glad to get back to our room. Something weird happened around 4am though. I heard 2 men talking very clearly. It sounded like they were IN OUR ROOM! Nobody was there, but it was enough to give me the creeps.","685":"This hotel is an oasis in the busy city. It is located within walking distance of the bus and railway terminals and is also conveniently located for visiting the old city on foot. The building itself is well maintained and the interior is stunning. We enjoyed dinner in the hotel each night we were there and the chef does an amazing job. There is inside dining or the terrace outside is lovely. I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel.","688":"This hotel was extremely convenient for us as we we taking the car on the ferry to Sardinia. It has free parking which we would have used if we were aware. We had arranged parking at Molo Santa Lucia car park so it would be easy to drive to the ferry. This hotel is about 100m from this car park. Clean, very helpful staff. Easy walk into the old city. Artours bus tickets available from the stand in the lobby each morning and the bus stop is very close. Lovely views from the top level bar.","690":"Difficult to find if you drive but once there it was a delight. Ballaro Market just steps away and all other sites within easy walking distance. Our room was spacious, airy and clean. Breakfast buffet very nice. All the staff went out of there way to make us comfortable. Unlike some others, we felt quite safe walking around at night.","693":"The hotel rooms are spacious and well furnished and the staff very helpful. We felt very unsafe walking back to the hotel at night and uncomfortable during the day. I wonder if the locked entrance door was a response to the area. Guests were buzzed in by reception staff. The hotel is within easy walking distance to many of the major monuments","701":"Decent location within 30 minutes walking distance of all the main attractions and shops (most are around 15-20). Good bus links. We were comfortable walking around even at night but if you have mobility issue you might have some difficulty - although this is true for most of Palermo.  The rooms were very dated but also very clean, free bottle of water first night and decent WiFi. There was also an onsite launderette which came in very useful with the heat wave!  Breakfast was lovely and fresh, and the terrace bar was relaxing. The bar over looks the docks and ferry terminal but it is not an unpleasant view.  The staff were wonderful and welcoming. We would be happy to stay here again.","702":"A lovely little hotel in a busy city. The service was friendly and efficient and the room was large and bright. Breakfast and dinner were wonderful. Walking was easy to all the central attractions . The hotel has real value for money.","705":"Elegant hidden boutique hotel in the center of Palermo. Great location to walk to all the local sites in the historic district. 5 Star accommodations. Modern designed rooms with a balcony. Eclectic and unique artwork throughout the property give it a very nice touch. Would definitely stay here again.","708":"We liked the hotel very much, but we did not feel safe in the neighborhood. We like to stay in central locations, which was one of the reasons we chose this hotel. Streets around the hotel were very dirty and we did not enjoy walking around. Breakfast was very good, but when we stayed for dinner it was not good and the service was terrible.","715":"Just returned from 3 nights at the Brunaccini and we enjoyed the boutique hotel. The location was perfect, located in old Palermo and within walking distance of numerous sites and restaurants. I don\u2019t understand some comments on the area being \u201csketchy \u201c. Yes there are some Africans that hangout but they are neither dangerous or intimidating. It is just part of old Palermo.\r As for the rooms, we had a 2 story jr. suite which was big and nicely furnished but we never used the downstairs living room.\r We only used the restaurant for breakfast which was ok but often they were slow to replenish items. Had to ask for the scramble eggs to be replenished and then they brought out enough for about 4-5 serving only.\r Staff was helpful and we used their airport transfer which cost only \u20ac50 vs. \u20ac60-\u20ac90 from the airport to the hotel when using the airport taxis.\r I would recommend the Brunaccini without a doubt.","718":"This is a small (18 rooms) boutique style hotel. Having read previous reviews raising concerns regarding personal safety, particularly at night, the hotel is located in one of the poorest areas of Palermo and people congregate outside the Library adjacent to the hotel. Whilst cautious we did not feel threatened at anytime. The Hotel\u2019s front doors are locked at all times and access is gained by pressing a buzzer. The Hotel is well situated to many of the visitor sites. Hotel room clean and restaurant very good. Buffet Breakfast fine, although depending upon when you choose to have breakfast, selection can be limited as plates not replenished promptly. Staff friendly.","722":"This hotel is a real gem. Location isn't the best [but perfectly safe even at night] but once one enters the lobby, pure pleasure. The hotel has been recently renovated so the rooms are modern and with up-to-date amenities but the charm has been retained. The real highlight, however, is Chef Carlo and his kitchen! Every meal we ate there was superb--probably the best food we had in Sicily and that is saying a lot!--because Carlo brings such passion and skill to his cooking. Family recipes but updated for healthy eating. Would return in a nanosecond just to taste Carlo's food!","726":"The location is excellent, within the narrow twisting roads of the old city. You can walk to the major sites without any problems and restaurants are everywhere and of good quality. The service at all levels in the hotel itself was perfect. The lobby is beautiful and in excellent taste. The room was spacious with high quality finishes design. Everything was clean. The breakfast was superb. Bravo Palazzo Brunaccini!","729":"The NH hotel is an average one, surely not the best NH, but with all comfort and friendly staff. The hotel is situated at the edge of the old center, but within reasonable distance. In front of the hotel there seems to be a parking lot, full of strange people coming to you to take care of the car, but they are not part of the hotel staff. To get a safe place, there is a small area you have to pay for, but not very comfortable","746":"This is a beautifully located hotel with water views and vistas of the harbor and the areas surrounding the city. The furniture and plumbing is all up to date, but the carpets and common areas need updating (it's currently underway). The staff was friendly and accomodating, included breakfasts were generous and of high quality.","747":"The hotel itself is nice in whole. Nice Location for main attractions, but on a narrow back street. Nice Showers.\r My problems with the hotel: the beds are hard, thin pillows, and the Internet is not good(you have to input the code every time you leave the room and it doesn\u2019t work well). The breakfast is satisfactory.\r \r I would try a different Hotel if someone asked me.","750":"Taxi from the airport to our hotel & back was \u20ac65 & \u20ac80 respectively ( we didn\u2019t ask the return price in advance & felt a little ripped off ). The hotel is comfortable, clean, good service ( front desk, restaurant etc ) & a reasonably good continental breakfast. They serve dinner & have a bar, but we tended to eat out. The hotel is in the heart of the old city ( Western Palermo ), very near a big daily market......ideal for exploring the old city on foot.","753":"Great location in terms of getting to tourist areas of Palermo. The room was immaculate, staff helpful and breakfast very nice. Only drawback is the gangs of men that hang around opposite the hotel and on the nearby corners.","757":"Nice old building in the heart of the old part of Palermo. The room was spacious, the staff friendly and the breakfasts excellent. The food in the restaurant was very very good. There were lots of tasteful artworks and antique furniture. The hotel was peaceful.","765":"The hotel is located in a seedy part of town next to the Ballaro Market. The Hotel is very difficult to find even with GPS. After dark, it is a scary place to be. I have lived and traveled in many major cities and I know where to go and when not to go outdoors. The hotel itself is relatively clean and modern. Our room was large, well furnished and clean. The bathroom and shower were first class. The problem is that room 105 overlooks the street and parking lot. The walls must be paper thin because we were awoken numerous times every night of our stay with street traffic and young people partying outside. In over 40 years of traveling I have never experienced anything like Room 105. We stayed three days and checked out early because we couldn\u2019t take the noise any longer.\r Outside of the noise and seedy location, the Hotel was modern and comfortable. The staff was great and the restaurant was above average. If you do stay here, either bring ear plugs or avoid Room 105.","773":"We travel around 100 days a year, and found this place to be superb! Whilst not large, the rooftop bar restaurant has to be seen to be believed. The property is on the end of the downtown area in Messina Sicily and is well worth a go.  The attention to detail, and the unique seeming make this must go.","775":"The hotel had a great location \u2013 walking distance to the cathedral, churches and shopping streets. It was also right next door to the Ballaro market, which is a must visit in Palermo. The d\u00e9cor in the hotel is elegant and tastefully done.\r However, the immediate neighbourhood wasn\u2019t the best \u2013 one entry road in particular (crossing Chiesa del Gesu) didn\u2019t really feel safe in the night.","776":"I stayed there while on business and we had a great time. Rooms are nicely decorated, staff very helpful and comfortable place to work in the evening. Car can be parked outside for free which was convenient. Typical Sicilian breakfast served-cakes and fruits. Will be coming back.","778":"Nice hotel, excellent restaurant, nice staff. Roomy suite, elegantly furnished. In historical Palermo, however, in a little bit strange surroundings, behind narrow streets, not very easy to find the way to, better instructions would help.","783":"This small but very boutique hotel is a little gem in the centre of Sicily. The few rooms that it has a very well sized and finished with very stylish yet simple furnishings. The bathrooms are absolutely lovely, shower rooms are very large and the fittings luxurious making for a great experience. The facilities unfortunately do not yet include a restaurant but the breakfast is very generous and varied including hot dishes if requested. The hotel also has a gorgeous heated pool that can be used throughout the year. The staff at Hotel Lanzirotti is incredibly friendly and super efficient, every time I visit Caltanissetta I make this hotel my home as it feels like the whole structure and its staff is solely dedicated to me! Wonderful stay and strongly recommended.","788":"This boutique hotel is absolutely stunning and Davide was a wonderful ambassador for the hotel as we checked in, explaining everything the hotel had to offer as well as sightseeing and restaurants. The room was spacious and very well presented with coffee machine and microwave. Breakfast on the roof terrace was a real treat and the staff were pleasant. We did hear the odd beep of a horn but did not encounter any noise from outside.","796":"Nice building in a poor location. not good for walking around at night. Stewed coffee at breakfast, cleaning taking place around you in the evening if you are having a drink, sky box in room not working, inconsistent wifi, no follow through on problems reported eg suggested solution to TV was to wriggle the wires. when it was reported back that this did not correct problem,no offer to send anyone to look at it or take any action. Guess that staff have switched off until next Summer.","809":"If you are looking for bright, shiny and new, this is not the hotel for you. It is older and has charm, but it is neither new or shiny. The staff couldn't have been more helpful, unlike the bright and shiny hotel we stayed in while in Rome. The breakfast was excellent, with a typical Italian menu of cheese and salumeri, sweets, fruit and good coffee, but also eggs cooked to order for a small up-charge.\r Our room was on the top floor, reached by elevator or stairs. It had a couch, a small table and chairs and refrigerator, a large bedroom with two full beds and a small but adequate bath.\r The location seems to be residential and quiet. It is within walking distance to the Opera House and to most of the sights in Palermo, depending on which way you walk from the hotel.\r There are several excellent restaurants within a few blocks that offered some of the best meals we had in Sicily at affordable prices.\r My adult son and I enjoyed our stay here. It was comfortable and suited our needs. Does it need some updating? Yes, but we found it to be clean and comfortable. My rating is based on the service, location and breakfast.","820":"There is no doubt, it's nh! Located at the entrance of Palermo harbor, this hotel gives the possibility to combine the mediterran sea with a short track to the center of Palermo. For a quick transfer to the other side of the old center, free shuttle buses are some minutes nearbye. The Hotel itself is OK, modern, some visible steps of extention renovation may be fund. The quality of rooms is, what you might expect from an nh. Clean, modern, functional. When we stayed here, the utilization had been very high. As a result, it's been very crowdy in the breakfast hall. Queuing for Toast, Coffee, Juice etc. Organisation could be a bit better in my eyes. The Hotel also has a small pool, usage didn't seem to be popular among the guests.","821":"Palazzo Brunaccini is a very centrally located hotel in the old part of Palermo. Unfortunately, we had been allocated a room on the third floor (lift stops at the second floor) and I had trouble with the stairs. Reception staff were able to allocate us another room which was very clean and tidy. Bedroom had a 4-poster bed and a nice balcony to a side street. Food in the restaurant was excellent, just let down waiting 20mins for our desert order to be taken. (only three people in the restaurant). Breakfast was great and varied and was being served in a lovely setting in a courtyard garden. This hotel is ideally situated right next to the Mercato De Ballero a very vibrant market where the local\u2019s shop, great to walk along in the morning. Access to the hotel entrance is via 3 very dodgy feeling alleyways and we never felt entirely safe, but overall a good experience and we would recommend it.","825":"terrible hotel (hotel war laut, sehr dreckig, schlechtes fr\u00fchst\u00fcck - nie wieder!)1. very noisy (windows let all noise from outside in, lots of shouting and loud motorcycle noise until 3 a.m.....)2. bathroom dirty (shower had not been cleaned for a long, long time, very dirty along the bottom and tiles)3. breakfast terrible (when we arrived at breakfast at 9:30 a.m. buffet was almost empty, it took over 30mins to replace some things....)","829":"Combination of Modern art and classical design. Astonished by Granita pistacchio con brioche in the breakfast menu. My friend Tommaso suggest me Lewis, when in Sicily must try granita pistacchio ! Pistacchio ! Pistacchio ! Pistacchio ! When crew ask me what would you like for breakfast- Strawberry............................. Peace & quite atmosphere all around hotel and it's close to the main street for shopping and transportation. Very tasty grilled chicken at the right side of hotel. Best choice when stay in Messina.","832":"My stay at the hotel was ideal for myself and for my family who had come to Sicily from the USA for my wedding. I truly don\u2019t have any negative things to say about the hotel. Top service, friendly flexible staff and delicious food for breakfast and lunch. The rooms were the definition of class and super clean. The staff even took care of transportation issues we had. I suppose the only negative point is the location which is somewhat difficult to get to if you don\u2019t have a ride arranged. But even this isn\u2019t a true issue as the area it\u2019s in is calm and appeared safe. I highly recommend this place!","833":"This hotel is everything you would expect from a boutique hotel. Beautifully decorated throughout and our room was very spacious and exceptionally clean. Breakfast was served on the beautiful roof terrace with very helpful, pleasant staff. The hotel was situated very conveniently near to the main shops restaurants. I would recommend this hotel.","841":"Beautiful Hotel, staff go beyond to help you with any requests you may have. nice outdoor sitting area next to the pool. Breakfast had lots of variety of food and my favorite was the fresh juices. the hotel has recently gone through a major refurbishment, half of the building is new and the other side is work in progress. we will definatelly visit again. Thank you NH and Giuliano.","845":"We had a wonderful room in the attic on two floors with a sitting room below, and two bathrooms (202). Should have been so nice, but the hotel was a bit odd. During our stay we rarely saw anyone - the receptionist was invisible behind the till, no welcome when we came in or went out. When we rang to ask them to fix a taxi to get us back from Monreale late one night, they would only give us a phone number to ring. As reported before, breakfast should have been good but was not replenished properly. Empty plates at 8.30 am. Coffee from a thermos. I took the 'last' tiny butter pat, and when my partner went back two minutes later, there was again just one butter pat in the bowl - doubtless to stop people using too much! Nice breakfast courtyard, though. Our room had two velux roof lights (we were in the attic) but apparently no way of opening or closing them without a ladder. For two nights it wasnt worth bothering the invisible staff, but for longer, the darkness in the bedroom bit would have been a bother. As all over the historical centre, once you get off the main streets, a lot of Palermo is still very run down, with ruined buildings, narrow, sometimes dirty, alleyways, and so on. People live their lives outdoors in the street. Ballaro, the neighbourhood where this hotel is, has a lot of Africans living there, which makes the market - famous, all day, every day - a wonderful mishmash of Afro Italian noise with lots of people just hanging out. Night and day. Edgy. But fun if you like that sort of thing.","849":"This hotel has a lot of charm! The art work is really interesting and the thoughtfulness of the rooms valued! This was a convenient location to travel by foot to many places. Be sure to pay attention to some surrounding landmarks as it can be a bit of a challenge to find if not careful.","851":"I visited this hotel for three nights and was very happy with the service that I got. On arrival the reception staff were friendly and welcoming and told us that we would get a renovated room, so my friend and I both had a renovated room on the first floor. I was not disappointed in any way. The room was well appointed with a good double bed, very comfortable mattress which made for a good night's sleep. The bathroom was newly fitted out with a very powerful shower over the bathtub.. i enjoyed both a shower and a bath and liked the facilities very much. The breakfast was good, usual mix for a hotel breakfast and the staff in the dining room once again were very helpful even setting up for us outside when a table became free...they couldn't do enough! Contrary to many reviews I was always able to find enough to eat and it was replenished often. The hotel is well situated to walk along the seashore and to pop into the centre and makes a very good base to see the sights of Palermo. I enjoyed my stay very much and I am sure as the hotel continues to be renewed all the rooms will offer the comfort that I enjoyed. Thanks to all the staff for a very happy stay.","852":"We stayed two nights and were pleased with the size of the room, good customer service and great central location. Staff helped to park car on property as Peking is definitely a challenge here. Cool art all over. overall the B&B is clean and they provide a nice breakfast. The only odd thing was the limit of one latte per guest - seemed odd but not a biggie. It is in a colourful area of town but we never felt unsafe. Close to markets and main street with restaurants. Staff was very helpful.","856":"Room very bland. Bed very uncomfortable and hard. This needs attention. Sheets mattress cover did not fit and kept coming away and had to be pulled back to fit mattress. Not making a good nights sleep. Larger fitted sheets would help. Shower needs some attention, could do with a good scrub and so could the glass doors. Skirting boards had many gaps, allowing dust to come in. Food good, but restaurant had same menu all week!! Restaurant staff very helpful, but the reception desk appeared unapproachable. Hotel in good position for sight seeing, but did not feel comfortable at night walking back to hotel.","860":"The area around the hotel is not safe, especially at night.The staff are not helpful, it\u2019s impossible to even get a cup of tea before 6pmThe restaurant food is good, but allow 3 hours for a 2 course meal.","861":"We enjoyed our 2 night stay at the NH Palermo. The room was spacious and attractive and the bed was very comfortable. Coffee bar, safe, too. The breakfast was very good although the coffee machine didn't work either morning. As part of a group our dinner was served in a separate dining room. It was below average. The only thing that spoiled our stay.","862":"Stayed here recently for 3 nights with friends.\r \r The hotel has great splendour and central location - but - the immediate surrounding area doesn't feel safe. Lots of rubbish, graffiti - I would not have felt comfortable walking around on my own after dark.\r \r Our allotted rooms could not have been more different. One was very large with a four poster bed. Mine in the attic with two floors but quite tastefully decorated. No porter was on hand so had to carry a heavy case up two flights of stairs as the lift only goes to the first floor. Not great after a long journey and at my advancing age! The Receptionist was slightly off-hand.\r \r The best thing about the hotel was its restaurant in the courtyard, serving very good food and reasonable-priced wine. Ate there every night - also didn't want to go wandering around near the hotel. Breakfasts were wonderful, beautifully presented and plentiful fruit selection. Chef walked around asking people how they were enjoying their meals.\r \r The location is very good and right next to one of the biggest and busiest street markets in Palermo, so a plus.\r \r The porter was around when we left to lug cases down the stairs. Thankfully.","866":"This was the hardest review to write and decide on a rating. The positive was so positive - the hotel is just beautiful. Rooms are decorated great, everything was new and very very clean. Also the rooms were very spacious and had everything you would need. Breakfast was wonderful and served on the roof deck. The staff was so helpful especially with dinner recommendations. Unfortunately I almost gave this hotel two stars (before settling on three) because despite the cleanliness and beauty, I am not sure I could stay again because the noise was unbearable. The traffic was so loud it sounded like you were sleeping on the street - any other city hotel keeps that noise out. The noise inside the hotel was just as bad - you heard every movement above, below and around you. It is really too bad as this place is so close to perfect.","872":"Palazzo Brunaccini is a 17 bed hotel in the old part of Palermo very comfortable.great greeting on arrival very efficient.very clean and tidy.Bedroom had a 4 poster bed and comfortable.balcony to side street and very quiet.Evening meal was excellent and could not fault any thing.waitress was very friendly and spoke good English.meal was a little expensive.Breakfast great variety and good.Excellent house keeping beds made every day towels changed every day. 5star service.would use again.","873":"We really liked the atmosphere in this newly renovated charming villa. We will remember the kind and efficient staff, delicious breakfasts (included), and the view of the countryside around Caltanissetta in central Sicily. Ideal for day trips to visit several coastal locations only a few hours away (Catania, Agrigento, Siracusa, among others). Highly recommend!","874":"We came across on the train ferry from mainland Italy and stayed at the VMaison Boutique Hotel to break our onwards journey by train to Palermo. The interior is beautiful and the room was lovely. Tea and coffee making facilities are included. There was some noise from the traffic outside once it started in the morning but it was not excessive. Breakfast in the beautifully appointed breakfast room on the second floor was selected from a menu and served to you; the pastries were absolutely delicious and you can also have granita with brioche, the Sicilian breakfast dish. Reception was very helpful in booking us a table for dinner and advising on public transport options. The single tram route has a stop close to the hotel and we intended to use it to get to the railway station; however no tram turned up during a 20 minute wait so we ended up walking. The previous evening, we had been charged \u20ac15 for a one mile taxi journey from the railway station, rather excessive.","876":"I spent 3 nights here , enjoying my stay. Very comfortable room, 4 poster bed & contemporary art on the walls, great shower. This hotel is ideally situated right next to the Mercato De ballero a very vibrant market where the locals shop, great to walk along in the morning. The food at the hotel is superb, as is the breakfast. Hotel staff very helpful. I would stay here again,\r The local area is a cultural melting pot , I felt comfortable walking around.","877":"Beautifully renovated Sicilian villa surrounded by peaceful gardens, with lovely pool. We loved the serene and exclusive atmosphere created by the luxurious interior design, stylish in every single detail, classic but with a touch of modern. Very friendly and warm staff members made us feel right at home. Caltanissetta is also perfectly located in the gorgeous Sicilian countryside. Great for day trips around the island. Great place for a romantic getaway!","879":"We were visited Palermo Oct 2019 and stayed at the hotel for 4 nights. We had no issues...rooms were recently redone and big for European standards (ask for the renovated rooms when booking), we had a balcony from which we could see the sea, the breakfast was great and not chaotic as others posted, and the staff were very helpful and friendly. It was a little walk to the historic center of Palermo and the area around the hotel is alittle run down but there were outdoor cafes just up the street from the hotel and we always felt safe.","880":"We arrived at this lovely boutique hotel me and my husband and my son and his girlfriend , we were shown to our beautiful rooms , very clean and comfortable .the staff were very professional Breakfast was lovely served in the pretty dining bar area with views over Messina . Elisabetta was really great at breakfast time we enjoyed our stay . Will be back thank you","883":"We stayed four nights and thoroughly enjoyed our time in the Messina province and this hotel. We took a taxi from the train station (20 euros, too much, we should have asked first) and were greeted warmly by the front desk staff. Our room was very clean, very fashionable, great WiFi, and although it was a corner room looking out to the street, it was quiet enough. The complimentary breakfast was great, our server Elisabetta was so accommodating and sweet. The coffee was outstandingly good, and I really enjoyed eating granita and brioche for breakfast, although there are also other choices. We ordered some (good!) food from the rosticceria on the corner, and when they delivered it to us in the hotel lobby, the hotel would not let us pay for it, saying the hotel would cover it. A nice surprise! We also received tips on places to eat and how to get there, and they offered to make restaurant reservations for us. The hotel is located on a fashionable shopping street, and besides the rosticceria, there is a cafe bar on the corner across the street and the metro stop is nearby. Messina is a nice place to visit, it doesn\u2019t feel touristy, the people were all nice to us, and Taormina is an easy train ride away.","884":"Prior to our stay I read reviews on trip adviser and actually contemplated changing our booking. I am so glad I didnt. The hotel itself was beautiful and the staff were more than helpful recommending places to eat visit. The area the hotel is located is very central, and as previous comments mention has individuals who loiter but they never bothered us at all.\r Breakfast had a wide variety of food to choose from.\r My only down point was I would have liked the inside of the shower to have been abit cleaner.\r If I returned to Palermo I would definitely return to this hotel.","891":"This nice hotel located at downtown area is very beautiful, comfortable and a real boutique building. With an Excellent Service and staff you can complete your days with a delicious Sicilian breakfast on the rooftop","898":"The views from the rooms overlooking to sea are wonderful - the sunrises are spectacular. The front desk staff were absolutely lovely and couldn\u2019t have been more helpful.  The location is good. Street-side seafood restaurants and street food stalls are a few hundred meters away, and the downtown area is a short walk.  Breakfast is quite good, but can be slow when there are tour groups. Luckily, they seem to hit the breakfast area as soon as it opens, and quickly clear out.  I would certainly stay again.","904":"Highly esthetic, new, top notch modern design. Very comfortable room. Warm and spacious. Breakfast is basic. Equipped with microwave though.. not too quite. Parking on the street is free. Highly recommended.","913":"Room nice but AWFUL smell of sewage. Room changed to two floors above but smell as bad. Advertised as quiet but very very disturbing loud road noise.Large tour groups spoiled the atmosphere and meant restaurant staff couldn\u2019t keep up with clearing tables etc. Altogether very disappointed.","914":"From the minute we arrived at 9am yesterday we have felt welcomed by the staff in this small, beautifully presented, spotless hotel. The staff are very friendly, welcoming, efficient and speak English fluently. As our room wasn't ready so early, we were invited to have breakfast until it was cleaned which wasn't long. Staff came up to inform us when the room was available, our bags were already in the room. The room is tastefully presented, facilities spotless with a small kitchenette with microwave, coffee machine, kettle, sink and well stocked bar and a good size wardrobe. Bathrobes and slippers provided. There's an iron and a professional size hair dryer. A bottle of water is provided each evening after a day sightseeing. Umbrellas are provided at the front door for client use. Highly recommend","915":"Walked into friendly staff, the room was more than comfortable apart from a ridiculous & bright green light in the ceiling @ the entrance door which lights the entire room all night & can interrupt your sleep. Pool area is great all the staff were friendly and helpful the food & drinks were nice @ the usual prices. When you leave the hotel for a walk the streets on either side a quite dirty & could be intimidating if you\u2019re not well travelled but don\u2019t be worried, the restaurants close by are all good @ decent prices. The waterfront only looks good from a distance. 6 10","918":"This hotel was the low-light of our Italy vacation. Room was clean, and comfortable, but other than that, is was nothing to get excited about. Wi-fi essentially didn't work, which is a big issue. The Espresso Coffee machine in the restaurant didn't work 2 days in a row, and we gave up on any food at the hotel. Lobby staff were helpful, when there wasn't a line of 10 people checking in. Lots of business travelers, which is fine, but didn't feel like a place I would vacation again. Pool area was nice and clean, but service at the pool was spotty.","920":"We have just returned, we were a little concerned about previous reviews mentioning the surrounding area and dodgy people. Yes the surrounding area is run down and messy but there are many cities around that are similar. There were some chaps around directing the cars but we had no problem at all, we walked into town and back every time and late at night and never felt threatened. It took us 10 minutes to walk into the edge of town and then another 10 minutes to main tourist trap sites. We arrived early on our first day and was welcomed and our room was available early, we had a \u2018new style junior suite\u2019. The room was clean but not to a high standard there were smears on the patio doors and the toilet had water mark stains we did not complain but others will expect a higher standard. The shower was good and bed comfy. It is a very busy road in front and there is constant road noise.  We had booked breakfast and I would say do not bother, it is chaotic and quite basic, the coffee machines either didn\u2019t work or would run out of milk or no cups. In fact on one day disposable cups were being issued. Topping up of supplies was very slow. A few times the tables were piled high with dirty plates etc and no clean cutlery glasses or cups. Only one day out of the ten was breakfast relaxing. There is a couple of local cafes around the corner to the right so I would use them.  The main reason I booked this hotel was the pool, it was a lovely oasis however it is only open seasonal so be aware of times. Also unfortunately we were bothered by mosquitoes in the day as there is no programme to reduce them in Sicily. The staff I dealt with, cleaners, pool man and others were friendly but they seem to be very under staffed especially at breakfast. We were grateful to be given a late checkout. The hotel cannot change the area it is in and the busy road, but it can improve the breakfast and cleanliness. Sadly I would not return.","923":"Currently staying in the \u201cjunior suite with view\u201d. The video below is the room that we have been moved into - the first was worse. First room- tiny triangle of a Juliette balcony too small to sit on - not that you would want to due to horrendous traffic noise from 6am, stinking fumes and directly above car park. Noise woke me at 6am. Asked to move and told that I\u2019d got what I\u2019d booked and they had no larger terraces. I pointed several balconies on the hotel. Then I was told the hotel was full, but moved later. New room has a terrace but is overlooking the filthy bin service yard below. How is this a \u201cjunior suite with a view\u201d as advertised? Toilet also filthy and service non existent - eg asked for some milk or coffee creamer to make some tea and told would have to pay a supplement unless went down to pick up myself. Traffic noise horrendous. Hotel a good 20 min walk to centre and costs over \u20ac20 at night in a cab. All sorts of dodgy characters hanging around in hotel car park. Avoid this hotel - it is terrible and a monumental rip off.","925":"This was the final hotel during our stay in Sicily. It was comparable in price to the others but by far the best. Clean, modern, well maintained it enjoys wonderful views across the bay. Staff were pleasant, welcoming and always so helpful - from a cheery greeting each morning from cleaners to attentive catering staff in the dining room, pleasant staff at the pool and delightful receptionists. Breakfast was excellent, well cooked and plentiful. Would recommend this hotel highly. It was our firSt stay in an NH hotel - we shall seek out others in future trips. Excellent value","936":"Really nice hotel and so affordable! The hotel has a really nice pool area which is really private and spacious, and has really good service for drinks. The room and bathroom was also so clean and modern. We didn\u2019t have breakfast or dinner at the hotel (breakfast was offered for \u00a317 per day per person which is just slightly too expensive) but we had a really nice time walking into the city centre every evening to look for a place to eat. It\u2019s a 5-10 minute walk into town.  The only downside would be there isn\u2019t a beach nearby - there is a bus to the nearest beach but the bus stop is a long walk from the hotel and taxis to the beach cost us around 30\u20ac for a single journey!","949":"After reading some of the less favourable reviews of this hotel we arrived with some trepidation. However, despite being very tired after a long days travelling, we were greeted warmly by Sevastano at the desk and quickly checked in. Our room was in the refurbished area of the hotel and was delightful. Clean, modern and with a lovely balcony overlooking the sea we were pleasantly surprised at the quality of the room. It was extremely clean, well thought out and the bed was so comfortable with high quality, crisp bed linen. The rooms are well serviced by hard working members of the housekeeping team.The pool area is a real bonus and is well serviced by Pietro who works extremely hard. I can understand that sunbeds may be at a premium in high season but we did not have any issues. The pool is a godsend after a days sightseeing. Great location for walking to lots of Palermo sights. Free bus just up the road does the similar route to hop on hop off bus. Great food, drinks and gelato in Bar Touring right and right out of the hotel...we took breakfast there daily. Much cheaper than hotel. Food offering in the hotel is not great compared to external establishments. Had no issues at night with safety  undesirables. Would highly recommend and will return as we loved palermo. La Kalsa is a very authentic area and you should have no reservations about basing yourself in this neighbourhood...it really is perfect for sightseeing.","977":"Even though we had nothing to complain about the hotel services, the hotel area is definitely not safe as mentioned in previous comments on tripadvisor and google and clearly not in line with a 4* hotel expectations. We've been ASSAULTED at night just a few meters from the hotel. Weird people are always hanging out near the cars in front of the hotel (the hotel is not even monitoring the 4 meters in front of the entrance and cannot insure your safety as soon as you'll step outside the entrance). During our stay some other clients have had the unpleasant surprise to have their car vandalized in FRONT OF THE HOTEL! Police station declared that it usually happens in this street Foro Italico and that the hotel is already aware of this issue but nothing seems to be done to reinstate safety.  We would absolutely NOT RECOMMEND staying at this hotel with a family or if you are not planning to spend the entire day inside the hotel as long as this issue will not be carefully handled. We should have consider more seriously previous comments on the hotel which were already reporting that kind of events.","987":"The location is just meters below the stairs to Palazzo Normanni and from there to many other interesting locations. The noise level was was high both from the street and other rooms. The room was very small, bathroom also tiny but everything was super clean. Breakfast was fine, a bit heavy on the carbs but balanced with a lovely fruit plate. The best part of this staying at this B&B is the young woman at the desk, she gave us the best recommendations and advice.","1000":"If you like a funky not-so-perfect place, this could be for you. The people are fantastic and the location and price also great. It's just as I get older I think I prefer a little more refinement. I appreciate all the efforts they make to create something unique and their attention to us was great! It was totally off season so it wasn't crowded.","1009":"I stayed at Town House Messina Paradiso for 2 nights and found the house welcoming and historically enchanting. My friends and I enjoyed our stay at this gracefully aging villa built in the 1920's that has managed to preserve some of the charm and dignity of that beautiful era. Our host Enrico was very accommodating and informative about the house and the nearby sites. The location was superb, the front entrance overlooking the Straits of Messina was breathtaking and a beautiful view in the morning light. Beaches were across the road and easily accessible, the center of town was just a short bus ride away and small restaurants dotted the beach for aperitivo or a light dinner. Enrico was courteous and we felt very comfortable with him, sitting on the veranda sipping a liqueur on those warm, sultry nights. This villa is a definite return if I am ever in Messina again and I would recommend it to anyone who is in need of accommodations in this beautiful city. Anna Lauricella","1012":"I am absolutely in love with Porta di Castro hotel.  Arriving as a solo female traveller, on an overnight train from Rome, I was hesitant to get an Airbnb in Palermo. I\u2019m so glad I didn\u2019t, and instead booked this affordable, beautiful and heartfelt boutique hotel instead. The staff was incredibly knowledgeable, kind and heartfelt, and went above and beyond the call of duty to make me feel welcome. I loved the funky, artistic vibe of this former monastery, and it\u2019s clear that the owner has filled the hotel with the beauty of his favorite objects. It was a 20 minute walk from the Palermo train station, which was fine in the morning, but definitely take a cab at night, as the drivers in Palermo were insane. Also, a MUST - you MUST go to the Palazzo Conte Federico, right down the street. Just go. This hotel was well located near the Palace and the great Cathedral, navigating a line between touristic walks and living amongst native Sicilians.  I can\u2019t say enough about this hotel, and can\u2019t thank them enough for being so kind and making me feel welcome. Book them! They will provide a unique and heartfelt welcome to this beautiful city.","1017":"We spent three fantastic days at Porta di Castro and enjoyed every minute. The staff were welcoming, attentive and knowledgeable. The location is handy to downtown and the historic center. We would recommend this B&B. Breakfast was generous and fresh. Can\u2019t wait to come back!","1035":"Spent two nights are this cool little B and B...very clean,,uniquely appointed,,excellent service and breakfast..comfortable king beds,,nice sheets too !!!highly recommend..host is onsite and extremely attentive...","1036":"what a charming place! lovely staff who couldn't be more helpful. I would have no qualms about recommending to friends. nice room with quirky decor and air conditioning. the breakfast was lovely too especially if you have a sweet tooth. I would definitely stay again.","1038":"Old world charm, very comfortable, excellent location \u2014 we walked all over the historic center from there, very near the palace and main cathedral, nice people who really had good advice , delicious breakfast ... I can\u2019t begin to see how it could\u2019ve been better. Would definitely recommend and would definitely return","1040":"The B&B hotel is in an amazing building in an ideal central location for exploring Palermo's historic centre and seafront. Our room was very comfortable, quiet and cool and the furnishings were wonderfully quirky. The excellent breakfast is also worth a mention. Thank you to all the very helpful staff who made our stay so enjoyable.","1045":"I booked the economy double room that was room 4 on the first floor. I don't recommend this room for anyone. It is extremely small, depressing and facing the busy street of the B&B. There is no opening window due to no privacy. I asked for another room but they were all booked.  The location is terrific and easy to reach restaurants, shops and attractions. The owner and staff are very pleasant and they serve the best breakfast. Unfortunately the room was underwhelming and strret noise made the visit not the best.","1047":"I would have given this place 5 stars if I was only rating the 2nd and 3rd night. The bedroom they moved us to on the second night was fabulous and what we thought we renting when I made the reservation. It had a patio and a small second room for my 22 year old son. The owner and staff were great. The breakfast is great. The parking that was offered for 10E a night was a close and secure.  I had noted wanting a room that gave my son a bit of a separate space. All of the 3 person rooms pictured had this feature. However, the first night we were put in a room that was not shown on the pictures. It had a double and twin right next to each other. It had a slanted roof because it was an attic room. My son is 6\u2019 3\u201d and had to duck when in that half of the room. The sitting area was 2 chairs crammed together in from of the mini refrigerator . When I complained. They showed me another room on the third floor that had regular ceiling but beds were right next to each other and the twin was a rollaway cot. The owner said they had just renovated the 4th floor and the website had not been updated. I suggest to make sure what room they are offering you and make sure to see the pictures  First room on 4th floor: first 2 pictures. Second room on third floor: the last 3 pictures.","1069":"The B&B is extremely well located close to the main tourist attractions. Alessandro and his staff are really passionate about their city and they spent time giving us recommendations and suggestions. Our room was clean and bright and breakfast was a feast of fresh products. Thanks for the amazing stay.","1073":"If you ever visit Palermo, this is the place to go. Excellent location and better host. Alessandro and his team go above and beyond to make you feel at home. The B&B is within walking distance of mostly every main attraction in this city. Highly recommended. PS: Breakfast is amazing :)","1079":"Lovely hotel. Rooms are decorated very nicely and were clean. A C worked well and breakfast was nice. Alessandro and his staff were very helpful and recommended some good restaurants and attractions to see. Very pleasant experience. Would highly recommend a stay here.","1083":"We stayed for 3 nights while exploring Palermo. The hosts are extremely helpful with recommendations for restaurants and activities. The hotel has a cool, quirky vibe but still was family friendly, and is a short walk from the Royal Palace and Palermo Cathedral. The rooms are comfortable and clean. Breakfast was delicious and bountiful.","1084":"We stayed at this charming B&B for one night and were greeted by the most amazing host very late in the evening of our arrival. Our room was quirky and original on the top floor and well appointed with a small fridge and good WiFi as well as easy to use a c. Our breakfast was an amazing adventure of all the fantastic food that Sicilians love for breakfast. Our host Alessandro was truly exceptional as was Massimo and all of the team. Service was extraordinary and all delivered with a smile and love for what they do. An excellent find and one that we would love to go back to next time we are here.","1086":"Port di Castro is a tourist friendly B&B hotel in Palermo.. We had everything we need of.. the owner, Alessandro is so friendly charming and helpful guy... Special thanks to Ylena and Dalila They were so generous..refill coffees and croussants. They feed us with all the goodies of sicily.. Thanks again Alessandro.. You have a friend in Istanbul","1087":"Cool location. Fantastic host(s). Perfect service. Wonderful B&B in the heart of lovely Palermo. We enjoyed every minute and WE WILL BE BACK soon. Alessandro has the best secrets of Palermo and he does take care of you BIG time. What a stunning place...really worth a visit and a must visit.","1089":"This hotel is in one of the narrow streets of the old city. They have there own parking place nearby. The staff go out of their way to help you. Walking in you will have an amazing experience. A designer place, glass floor above you, all sorts of objects around. The rooms all have their own design. Sometimes it goes as far as letting design go before practicality. But it is easy to forgive as it all is so nice. Breakfast is really great, more than anyone can master. A fantastic stay, a surprise and a gem, hidden or not.","1092":"3 couples spent 2 night here and we were treated like family. Alejandro is the best host one could ask for. The rooms are funky but fun and the beds were comfortable. Breakfast was SWEET. Great coffee and the croissants...... wow! Location is good and its a 15 minute walk to the center area. Parking is crazy so call him first and he will park your car... well worth it.","1096":"An excellent interestingly decorated hotel in walking distance to all the sites of Palermo. The staff, and in particular, Alessandro, were very keen to explain what to see in the town. Alessandro was very proud of his Hotel and rightly so. He made us feel very comfortable and at home. The breakfast was amazing with the delights of Sicilian food being offered. Almost no need to have lunch. We had a car which Alessandro helped us with our luggage and then took the car to a private parking space for the few days we were there (20 euros for 2 days). It wasn\u2019t necessary to have a car in the old city. We walked everywhere.","1101":"When booking, our emails with Alessandro were prompt and clear. We had concerns driving into Palermo but he sent us a parking address and said call upon arrival. Our GPS brought us to the spot and when we called within seconds Alessandro tapped on our car window, parked our car and took our luggage. We were very early arriving and they immediately set us at a table and brought us a surprise late morning breakfast. We where able to check in early and they spent time mapping out Palermo sights for us. We found the hotel charming. The location is great. We were just minutes from the Norman Palace and the main pedestrian street in Palermo. This old church has been carefully renovated as a b&b. This is not the sterile atmosphere of a traditional hotel. It is truly eclectic in decor and a little quirky. But we found the bed and bath in our room very comfortable and convenient. Our room had a sofa and an extra twin bed which gave us plenty of room for luggage and relaxing. I loved our little balcony overlooking the street that allowed us to say hello to the neighboring balconies of local residences. It was a surprisingly quiet street at night. The breakfast always included fresh fruit and Sicilian pastries and for us cafe americano. This was a very pleasant and unique lodging experience that we highly recommend as an alternative to a traditional hotel.","1106":"The hotel is in a medieval building. The breakfast room used to be part of a church. So, it's very quirky and the staff are lovely. We took the triple room, which looked great but it was right on top of the breakfast area and overlooking the reception - with a glass wall looking down but a curtain to stop anybody looking up. This meant we needed ear plugs to sleep. We really should have moved to a higher floor because it felt like we were on display. Location wise, you are a stone's throw from the Norman palace and cathedral. It's a bustling working class area so we also got to hear the neighbour's conversations in neighbouring buildings - especially from the window in the shower. So - fun stay but I'd probably check into the Eurostars next time. But by all means try it.","1117":"Excellent quirky hotel in Palermo with wonderful staff. Great atmosphere and they serve fantastic breakfast. The car parking was limited so check before you book. Within walking distance of Palermo's best attractions.","1118":"Business trip. Very nice owners. Clean, comfortable, safe place to stay. Beautiful staircase! Italian breakfast, great cappucino. Close to the places which are worth seeing like harbour. Next to the bus stop to the airport.","1119":"Alessandro, the owner, and his lovely staff can't do enough to make you happy and keep you comfortable. We had lots of questions about things to see, and when the staff didn't know and we couldn't find something online, they found out for us. We loved the antiquities around the hotel (including in our room) and their combination with the modernity of - for example - the lobby and its glass ceiling. We liked our room a lot and especially the great shower. Cleanliness level is excellent and all the glass in the room (considerable) is spotless and smear-free. Be aware that in one room at least (ours which I think was #12) one of the bathroom walls is made of glass and even though there is a screen, one is not totally private vis-\u00e0-vis one's companion, and this might bother some people - so just ask. Marvellous bed (pillows could be softer), effective heating which we needed as it was a pretty cold week. The breakfast is very generous - a platter of prepared fruit, a plate of croissants with sweet fillings, and toasted cheese ham, plus juice and hot drinks. Thank you to all the delightful staff for a very enjoyable 6 nights!","1121":"Love this place! My room was small but super pretty with the loveliest bathroom ever (and I spend a lot of time in hotels). The taps need some working out, but the staff was most helpful. I even had a nice terrace with a pleasant view and a perfect place to sit and take in the atmosphere. However, if you want to enjoy a morning coffee in it, bring a travel kettle. Breakfast was wonderful, everyone got a platter of fresh fruit, juice, and the most delicious filled croissants, including one with a kind of pistachio Nutella which I am now addicted too o. If you want egg and bacon go to the UK The staff and the owners are super nice and helpful, despite it saying on their website that you cannot check in after 9.30pm, a phone call was all it needed for the owner to come and check me in well after 10pm. As if all this wasn\u2019t enough, the location is superb. Almost next to the Norman Palace, allowing you to get to the Palatine Chapel early, and round the corner from the Cathedral. All of Palermo can be explored on foot. There\u2019s a little shop very close where you can stock up on water and basics very cheaply I have to go back to Palermo in a couple of days and usually I would try another hotel, but this time I made an exception and booked it again. Which also meant that they kindly kept one of my suitcases (I know! I had to buy another as the sales were on and we are dangerously close to some excellent shopping) completely free of charge Oh and btw, there\u2019s a lift now Pictures - Julius, the placid hotel dog. Bathroom, view from terrace twice, breakfast room, super funky bathroom, which has inspired me to redo mine","1123":"April 2016 close to the center and to the university. Good breakfast. Possibility to use kitchen utilities during all the day. Cosy, elegant and comfortable although it's on the first floor without lift.","1124":"We arrived in Palermo on an early flight and the hotel had arranged for a driver to meet us and take us straight to the hotel which saved us from having to pay to park a hire car which we wouldn\u2019t have needed in the city. The hotel is located in a busy side street just a short walk from the cathedral and all of the main sights in the old town. Although the hotel was busy with people checking out, we were warmly welcomed and our luggage was stored until our room was ready. We were offered something to eat and a coffee whilst we were talked through a map of the city with all of the places to visit highlighted and restaurants recommended. Alessandro and his staff spoke excellent English and were very helpful throughout our stay. The hotel is quirkily decorated with huge attention to detail. Our room was on the third floor - at the time there were only stairs but a lift was being installed. However our cases had been taken up for us. The room was good size with a entrance area and a large bathroom. The bed was comfortable and there was plenty of storage space and a small fridge. There is no restaurant serving evening meals but there are so many good restaurants nearby. However, the breakfasts were amazing! Served at tables in a small breakfast room or the lobby, a selection of fruit was freshly cut and served on a platter along with a selection of pastries and some toasted cheese sandwiches. There was a choice of tea and coffee and fresh fruit juice. On the first mo, we were also served a slice of cassata at the end of breakfast which was delicious. The location meant that it was easy to go sightseeing and pop back to change and go out for dinner. It was just a short walk to everything we wanted to visit. On our last morning, we were given a signed tile from the original building to take home with us - a lovely memento. They also arranged a driver to take us to the station to pick up our hire car for the rest of our holiday. Staying here helped us to get the most out of our first visit to Palermo and I would highly recommend it both for the friendly atmosphere and it\u2019s ideal location.","1148":"Great people! Exceptional service! Charming hotel! Perfect location! My wife and I rented a car at the airport in Palermo and drove to B&B Porta di Castro. We don't recommend driving in Palermo. But there are many other ways you can get to this hotel (the hotel will help you) and this SHOULD be your destination. This charming hotel is perfectly located for walking around the amazing historic sites in Palermo! And after a great day in Palermo, B&B Porta di Castro is such a warm a welcoming place to come back to. The owner and the key staff members all speak English -- and they are VERY helpful. If we go back to Palermo, we will stay at B&B Porta di Castro again for sure.","1150":"The staff has been friendly and we got a warm welcome getting breakfast. The breakfast is nice, especially you will get as many freshly brewed coffes, Cappucinos etc. as you wish. Some of the rooms are a bit thight, some are noisy or without windows. So we recommend to check before booking which of the rooms are available. Friendly driver for excursions or airport shuttle service.","1154":"A fantastic find in a quiet side street of Palermo, this B & B was located a really short distance from the cathedral. The owner met us outside late in the evening to take over the driving to park our car in his nearby car park. He showed us a local place to eat and made sure we would get a table even at 10 in the evening. The building itself is old and atmospheric with the quirky finds of the owner decorating the place. The rooms were comfortable and spacious. Breakfast was huge, we simply couldn\u2019t eat everything we were offered. Hugely hospitable staff and owner. We would return.","1158":"We have recently spent 4 nights at Porta Di Castro, a very quirky, unusual and lovely B & B in the old part of Palermo. Located just minutes walking distance to the Norman Palace, Cathederal and other places of interest. Breakfast was more than we could eat including fruit, various croissants, ham & cheese toasty, all fresh and very filling not forgetting coffee, tea and juice. Staff friendly and Alessandro was very helpful in arranging a trip to Mt. Etna and Taormina which we thoroughly enjoyed. And many thanks to Maurizio for driving us and persevering with Google translate. All in all, we had a wonderful stay.","1163":"Ended our trip to Sicily staying one night at the Porta di Castro. As we arrived early, we went to drop off our bags, but were welcomed inside and to the breakfast room whilst our room was being prepared. We were given free of charge a fantastic breakfast and then were shown to our room. We loved the quirkiness and originality of the decor. The hotel is situated just a few minutes walk from the major attractions in Palermo. A big thank you to Alessandro and the staff. You are doing a wonderful job!","1164":"It hasn\u2019t been super easy to find the l\u2019Uliwood, and, it is in an easy place: a dirt track rigth next the large square of the stadium Tomaselli in Caltanissetta. We drive along the narrow unwinding road among the olive trees to the modern building that has hosted us. In the little court yard, a cat welcomes us. I call Rosalind on phone, the young owner, who is now picking olives together with Emanuele. She arrives soon, she shows us the bedroom \u2013 named \u201cFico d\u2019India\u201d , that is prickly pear \u2013 that is modern and we like it immediately. We like also Rosalinda. She tells us about the difficulties encountered by whom, in Italy, wants to start an entrprise in a serious way. They are a little worry, Rosalinda & Emanuele: two young people, \u201cclean\u201d, filled up with entusiasm and, i\u2019d say, joy. But they keep on being careful with the costumers, to follow the rules and \u2026 pick olives and oranges. We like them. We are sorry to stay only one night. Also Caltanissetta, of which you don\u2019t hear about with touristc sense, has pleasantly surprised us, with its Strata Foglia and its central Corso Umberto. I think we would go there again, crossing Sicily in diagonal, and we would stop again at Uliwood.","1166":"Our stay in Caltanissetta would not have been the same without Uliwood. The room we stayed in was very spacious, comfortable, clean and had a fantastic veranda overlooking the countryside. Our hosts greeted us as soon as we arrived and was very informative of the places we could visit both within the city and the environs. We would sincerely recommend others to stay in this B&B because you will not be disappointed. Many thanks once more to our hosts ... we will see you again!","1172":"Me and dear husband spent two nights in this Lovely, cosy, comfy and clean B&B  We strongly recommend it to anyone wishing to stay in Caltanissetta. Wonderful hosts, yummy breakfast with good choices of food and beverages. Lovely restaurants nearby.","1175":"The hotel is in a great location but it's facilities are disappointing. The bar is in a corridor, there is no comfortable lounge area and the Spa has to be booked by the hour, at a cost of Eu 30. The website led us to believe that it was available for all guests, which we took to mean we could use the pool and hot tub at anytime the Spa was open. Sadly this is not the case. Our room overlooked the central open air court, which was noisy in the evenings when there was a private function in the Meeting Room, as attendees spilled over into the central court. We had a few maintenance isses as well, on 2 mornings our electricity tripped out, the bathroon towel rail only ever partially heated and the bathroom hairdryer never worked. The staff were friendly and helpful, the room spotless and the 1 evening meal we ate in the restaurant was good. Breakfast was good.","1179":"Extremely well located hotel to discover the city. Price is correct. Beautiful old building in great condition. Only 15 minute walk from the train station and located right in the heart of the old city.","1183":"mini bar empty after room change, split based air heaters, no coffee machine (just tea), room change after strong fancoil noise. SPA (pool, sauna) needs to be booked upfront and paid; was occupied all days.","1186":"We stayed at Uliwood for a night travelling from Palermo to Ragusa. Had we known how clean, comfortable and welcoming this place was we would have stayed longer. Excellent hosts, extremely knowledgeable and proud of the local sights. Great breakfast and good value.","1189":"Excellent central location, surprisingly quiet. Everything worked fine, blue lighting in the bathroom was fun. Friendly staff. Located in pedestrian zone, so a bit tricky to access. Not barrier free, you will need to navigate some steps if you are not on the first floor","1192":"I stayed here sadly for one night as I travelled pretty quickly through Sicily, however I was met at the Port late at night by the super friendly and lovely owner. Honestly - couldn't have asked for a nicer place, convenient location to the city and a super duper clean place to stay. Great price and a superb nights sleep. Highly recommended. :)  Cheers Nat","1193":"Lackluster, uncomfortable rooms conveniently not located close to the lobby. We had to take two elevators and a staircase to get to our room and the marble staircase to the courtyard was unlit at night. No complimentary coffee in the room. Only stale tea and an overpriced bottle of water. Good restaurant, but not worth a trip to Palermo for.","1197":"A great hotel, clean and in a great location. Wouldn't necessarily go back to Palermo but if I did, would definitely stay here. In the heart of the city, but spacious and clean. Staff are helpful and knowledgeable.","1200":"We got a recommendation for this BnB in Caltanissetta and stayed one night on our way to Palermo. What a great place. Definitely 5 star accommodation, superior bedding, very comfortable bed, full size shower (you know what I mean if you have travelled in Italy), super young couple running the place, could not be more helpful...and be sure to ask for a taste of their own olive oil...superb. Can highly recommend.","1203":"The hotel is located in an excellent position, in the middle of all the major attractions of the town. The personnel is very kind, breakfast is good but could be better, some common areas and room should be renovated. Nice view from to room. Terrace should be valorized.","1212":"Nice place downtown, near all the most important artistic sites and museums. Great location, with interesting SPA. Some gaps need to be filled in order to get top marks. For example, the low quality hair dryer in the bathroom, which stopped after just one minute of use, or some important lacks during the breakfast.","1222":"I couldn\u2019t ask for a better hotel and location that is right in the heart of historical Palermo. Staff was outstanding and very helpful. Breakfast was excellent and this hotel gets my highest recommendation.","1224":"Ideal location for exploring central Palermo and within walking distance of all the main sights. It\u2019s a beautifully restored old building which adds to the charm of staying in the city. Our room was modern, spacious and comfortable and staying at the hotel itself was a pleasant experience.  The hotel isn\u2019t easy to drive to (with it being in the middle of a semi pedestrianised area) and although there is parking it\u2019s is a 5 10 min walk away and not well publicised. They made us (attempt to) drive to the hotel in the middle of a festival, which was actually impossible due to the road closures. There wasn\u2019t much of an apology or much understanding that an hour stuck in the Palermo one way system could have been avoided if they had told us to go straight to the parking lot.....  The limited seating at breakfast (which was otherwise nice) and the fact you had to pay for access to the sauna pool facilities were my only other small gripes, in what overall was a very nice hotel.  Worth staying!","1226":"The hotel is not as nice as appears in the photos. It is a very average place. Our room was very far away from main lobby, requiring two separate elevators. The room itself was dark and not comfortable. Would not return!","1227":"As the other reviews have stated, this hotel is in the best location in Palermo. Our room had a balcony so close to a beautiful church you could almost touch it. The room was attractive combining old and new elements. Breakfast was very good with lots of items to choose from. Hotel staff were efficient and helpful when needed. I had my best meal in Sicily at the in-house restaurant. The only negative was low hot water flow in the shower, which I alerted the front deck about. Overall....a great place to stay in a fascinating city.","1230":"great location great breakfast great staff but taxi can`t drive to front door because street is closed to cars. very few English tv stations but all of italy is like that unless a smart tv. close to most sites and staff very nice. everything in walking distance and very safe at night","1233":"Good service in general, good restaurant food, very nice decoration. The bedroom spacious and comfortable although the air conditioning made some noise. The breakfast buffet is not very extensive, but what they serve is of good quality","1236":"The main draw of this hotel is its fantastic location, right in the city centre, and within walking distance of all major attractions. Our room was very quiet and quite spacious. The breakfast spread was nice - although mostly offering sweet options, and the breakfast room was often overcrowded. The only real disappointment was being charged for the bottles of water in the room, which were not marked as part of the minibar. Overall, excellent location and good value for money","1237":"The hotel is very well lacated, and thats all.... Dont try to use the SPA, its open nota for gests... gests are turists and during the day they will be visiteng the city... wen the come back to trhe hotel, the SPA will be closed.","1239":"A few metres from Quattro Canti, at the heart of Palermo's historic centre, this hotel puts you within an easy walk from most of the city's main attractions. Housed in an old Palazzo, but sensitively modernised, there are necessarily a few quirks to the layout, notably a somewhat disjointed journey to rooms on the upper floors necessitating the use of two separate lifts with a short walk between them. The corridors are a little labyrinthine also. But that's all of the downside. The staff are helpful and cheerful, the rooms are immaculately clean, the aircon works ( though ours was a little noisy) and the furnishings are good. We had a superior double which was quite large, with a huge comfy bed. Breakfast is the usual buffet, taken in a pleasant internal courtyard with a large palm tree as the central feature. Choice is adequate but not outstanding. The street outside is very limited as to traffic, so no problem with noisy vehicles. We enjoyed our stay.","1264":"A great three days. We leave laden with olive oil to take back with us to Australia. Accomodations, breakfast and dinners were excellent. We wish we could stay longer. Sylvia and Bruno were wonderful welcoming hosts. We spent one lazy day by the pool and felt refurbished for the drive to Palermo. Highly recommend. If we come to Sicily again we\u2019d plan to stay again.","1269":"Nice courtyard area and breakfast . Rooms not brilliant, dated, but a good location in the historical part of town, but do not recommend if you are driving as very hard to find and navigate to. Wouldn\u2019t say 4 star.","1282":"Quintocanto is the perfect place to stay in Palermo if you want to be in the center of everything. It is walking distance from many iconic sites and monuments. Right outside the door are shops, restaurants, history and more. It was even a quick walk from the train station. Having traveled to Palermo many times this location beat them all.","1285":"We stayed at Quintocanto Hotel and Spa for a short notice trip to Palermo with two of our children. We enjoyed the hotel very much. It was large. With two bedrooms a living room with dining table and a large bathroom. It nicely decorated and fully stocked with amenities. I would stay again","1289":"Our time with Silvia and Bruno was a highlight of our trip to Sicily. We stayed for 1 week in late Sept early Oct. Their farm is beautiful and comfortable. The apartment's kitchen was not as well stocked as other apartments that we stayed, but it is enough to prepare simple meals. It is more important to eat dinner prepared by Silvia and Samantha, if you can, because the food is fresh and delicious! Breakfast was always good as well. We highly recommend this agroturismo.  Il nostro tempo con Silvia e Bruno era una del migliori del nostro viaggio in Sicilia. Siamo stati per 1 settimana a fine settembre   inizio ottobre. La loro azienda \u00e8 bella e confortevole. La cucina dell'appartamento non era cos\u00ec ben fornito come altri appartamenti che siamo stati, ma \u00e8 sufficiente per preparare i pasti semplici. E 'pi\u00f9 importante mangiare la cena preparata da Silvia e Samantha, se \u00e8 possibile, perch\u00e9 il cibo \u00e8 fresco e delizioso! La colazione era sempre buona anche. Consigliamo vivamente questo agroturismo.","1296":"Very central location and very quirky we liked it . Had a few maintenance issues which the maintenance man thought by hitting things with his hands works , er no. I fixed the toilet in the end as we left it not working and when we returned it was no different ( I'm a plumber by trade) Spa looks ok but swimming there is a joke of a price \u20ac30 a hour each person comes with something else but you cant just swim . Not good","1299":"Very clean place! Pleasantly surprised with our big room! We got a beautiful view of the main street and the interior piazza of the hotel! Best breakfast we had in Italy!  Had some trouble sleeping due to a lot of noise in or around the hotel. What seems to be a fire alarm went off several times.  Their complimentary soaps in the room are amazing!  I checked out the Spa and got one of the best massages I\u2019ve ever had! I also got to enjoy the sauna and steam room. Only complaint I have is that I was charged separately for the spa access from he massage. If I purchase a massage the bath access should be included.","1302":"very nice hotel, well located, the people ata the front desk very kind and helpful. Many restaurants and stores nearby. everything is at walking distance. very good breakfast Our room was a awesome, with a nice balcony, just over a old church","1308":"Hotel is in great location so that you can walk everywhere. Rooms were nice, clean and did not disappoint. Courtyard lovely to sit and chill. Staff in restaurant and reception were helpful, cheerful and polite. As a group of 7 celebrating a birthday it was the perfect choice our only disappointment was on the day of departure. We were unable to get any of the three rooms as a late check out as the hotel was fully booked. We checked with reception in the morning and we were advised that it would be ok to use the Spa changing room for a quick freshen up and to get changed before going to the airport. When we did we were literally attacked by Francesco, don't know who he was, one minute he was hoover the stairs the next minute swearing in Italian and telling us to get out. He was rude and offensive and this put a sour taste on our whole experience. He did not want to listen that we had asked and it was not our fault. Someone should have a word with him.","1316":"Sillitti Farm is a haven in the heartland of Sicily - especially after driving the somewhat chaotic roads and highways, which appear to be under constant reconstruction. It was an absolute delight staying with Silvia and Bruno in their lovely farmhouse amidst of wheat fields and almond olive orchards. Our apartment, homey and spacious, had fabulous views front and back, looking onto acres (or hectares) of wheat, olive and almond trees, and blue skies of puffy clouds (no exaggeration). I also loved the sounds of birds, and wind whistling through the trees in the late afternoon and also at dawn. (I was so excited that I captured dusk and dawn on my camera, which are some of my best and favorite videos). Silvia is a most gracious and charming host, interesting and intriguing conversationally, and passionate organic farmer. Her breakfasts were first-rate: home made bread (with her own wheat), delicious almond cake and fruit tart, home made preserves and more. We also had a lovely dinner (optional) with her and her husband, Bruno, where she served the most fabulous home-made anniletti (ring pasta) with ragu. She also introduced us to fresh ricotta and Inzolia, a popular Sicilian wine which became my favorite Sicilian white. While Sillitti Farm is challenging to access without a car, it is well worth the drive. (UNESCO sites within driving distance include Valle di Templi, Agrigento and Villa Romana del Casale, Piazza Armerina.) Even if there are no other major attractions to visit, you can simply unwind, rejuvenate, and be lost to the world, when you stay at Sillitti Farm.","1344":"Excellent location to walk to many sites. Lovely feel to the hotel, but service could be improved. We had a couple of little mix-ups during our stay and I felt they could have been handled better by the staff.  We didn't do breakfast, but we did do dinner at the restaurant one night. They are not open for lunch. Dinner was good. Typical European service. :grinning: There are lots of little cafes and shops and restaurants just steps from the hotel.  We stayed in two different rooms during our visit. Both were nice, but not the cheapest options.","1357":"The hotel itself is very charming, but the overall experience not worth the money.  Apparently, the hotel has a spa area - upon arrival we\u00b4ve learnt that using the pool requires prior reservation and it\u00b4s already booked out throughout our stay. First disappointment.  Breakfast was a second one. We went downstairs at 9:30am and there were only leftovers waiting for us. We had to ask the staff for everything - starting with bread, salt pepper, butter... The staff looked very tired and not customer-oriented at all - we had a pile of dirty plates on our table, which hasn\u00b4t been picked up. Not a 4* experience to me.","1360":"On first impressions this looks like a smart boutique hotel. Once you get past the facade you soon realise this is a work in progress. The check in service is very slow and inefficient told our room would be ready at 2pm so came back at 2.30pm to find that the cleaners were still in the room. This only after we had gone up the a very second hand lift luckily we didn\u2019t go up the stairs as we found out later on these are exceptionally dangerous broken and cracked and in darkness no lights. The room was very small, and what promised to be boutique turned out to be shoddy as the quality of the workmanship left a lot to be desired. Air conditioning didn\u2019t work, the tv kept dropping out, the window didn\u2019t shut properly, door frames badly fitted, tiles in mirror in bathroom looked like it was done by a diy\u2019er . Not to mention the noise of workman banging from 7am -7pm the whole time we were there. In summary the staff considered themselves to be providing a high quality product which exposed itself as delusional when you got past the front door.i would only consider recommending this hotel in about 5 years when they have finished the work but don\u2019t expect 4*even then. Also this certainly not disabled friendly as stairs to lifts!","1363":"Warm welcome by staff on reception. We were early so left our luggage & went to explore the local area. The hotel is really well positioned, literally in the middle of the historic centre at the Quattro Canto intersection with restaurants, sights, the sea etc all on your doorstep & within walking distance. Once you are inside the hotel, whether that be the courtyard or your room, it is so peaceful .. you wouldn\u2019t realise the hubbub once you take a step outside. Hotel is a great blend of modern interior  decor combined with an older characterful facade, which worked really well. Our room (318 - suite) was just as I\u2019d pictured & seen online. It was lovely & spacious with a day bed & normal \u2018queen size\u2019 bed. Our room had a wonderful balcony with lovely red flowers & views of a nearby dome, which provided a nice little sun trap during the day. Our one gripe, which didn\u2019t detract from our overall stay was the breakfast, which was disappointing (especially for a 4* hotel). There didn\u2019t seem to be any system in place, with crockery, cutlery and hot food in particular (bacon & scrambled eggs only) running out. The one time we did get chance to try the \u2018hot\u2019 food, it was cold! We didn\u2019t get chance to use the spa facilities or sample the food of an evening in the restaurant so cannot comment on these elements. Overall we were really pleased with our choice & would highly recommend.","1369":"This hotel was in a perfect location, very close to everything. I walked to the opera. The staff were very helpful with whatever I asked of them. The rooms were nice and very quiet. I was quite pleased with everything!","1376":"Located at the crossroads of historic Palermo, this former palace has been tastefully converted. The rooms are comfortable, the outdoor terraces are great, the staff is helpful and professional and even the manager took time to personally make recommendations.","1398":"We stayed for two very interesting days at Silvia's and Bruno's at the end of October. The weather was windy and wet but the hospitality was genuine and warm. Silvia is a keen cook and the meals were delicious and entertaining, meeting other guests from other parts of the world. It made a big difference staying on a working farm, learning about the production and harvest of olives and almonds and really gave us a feel for a Sicily which many tourists will miss. It was also geographically a great base to start discovering the surrounding Greek and Roman history and we found both Silvia and Bruno really helpful and entertaining sources of information.","1405":"Do a city tour first and then explore on your own as this is a rich city for history and tradition. Ideally stay outside the city and travel in to explore as there will be better hotel facilities outside. For Palermo eating was very good and reasonably priced.","1407":"This hotel definitely had a vibe. The majority of staff were delightful, except 1 male late night at the desk. He was a bit rude. The view from the restaurant was exquisite. The rooms were European small but clean. Beds comfy. Only 2 complaints, no dressers or not enough hangers for clothes and the shower was very tiny. I would recommend to others and stay again.","1418":"We stayed here for four nights and loved the location. The front desk staff are very helpful and the price is great. The hotel is a short walk from the train station and close to Four Corners. We\u2019d stay here again.","1422":"We had a bit of trouble finding our way to the farm but Silvia was ever-so-patient as I repeatedly called to clarify our directions. Silvia\u2019s farm is a real working farm where olives, almonds, wheat, beans and other organic produce are grown. It sits on 90 hectares and is beautiful, peaceful and quiet. Everywhere you look there are flowers of all varieties growing- many beautifully scented. It\u2019s a joy to sit and look across the property and beyond. It was wonderful to finally meet Silvia, whom I had only communicated with via email. She is a warm and very genuine person. We spent an afternoon at the pool then went for a walk outside the property with the resident dog Lola following us. We enjoyed a delicious meal with Silvia and her equally friendly husband Bruno. Dinner consisted of homemade ricotta; thinly sliced zucchini with olive oil, salt and pepper; stuffed cherry tomatoes; a pasta casserole with eggplant, peas and sauce; then a third course of spedini; asparagus; fava beans and artichokes; and finally desert of homemade tangerine gelato. While the food was excellent, the company of and conversation with our hosts is what made the evening so memorable. Those are the moments travelling when one feels changed by the experience. That is something that rarely happens in a restaurant- no matter how good the food. We slept soundly in our comfortable though modest rooms. The next day after a lovely breakfast we purchased bottles of Silvia\u2019s organic olive oil to give as gifts. If you find yourself in the center of Sicily-perhaps travelling from one end of the island to the other- be sure to stop for a night or more with Silvia. You won\u2019t be disappointed.","1424":"We agree with all the previous comments regarding this farmstay. It really was the highlight of our trip to Sicily. Silvia and Bruno were wonderful hosts. The location was perfect - lovely setting in the hills with gorgeous landscaping and a nice pool to enjoy. They have olive groves and have olive oil made, and additionally grow organic almonds and lentils. We enjoyed sharing interesting conversations with them over welcoming drinks and limoncello at the end of the day. Having the opportunity to see how the farm works, and to learn about the Italian way of life was a real plus of the stay. Silvia speaks quite good English, so it was easy to converse. If you get the chance to experience this, we highly recommend it.","1426":"We spent two nights here, as part of a two week tour of Sicily. Everything about this place is fabulous. The room was cool, tranquil and perfectly situated -you could smell the fresh rosemary when you walked out the door. The pool was brilliant after a hot day of touring the nearby sites, making the location great for accessing the sea and some of Sicily's great historical ruins. Silvia's breakfasts were heavenly, and the dinner she prepared on request was a real, authentic taste of organic Sicily. Azienda Agricola is a proper working farm, so we were able to pick vegetables from Silvia's patch for our lunch, and really feel like we were getting a slice of Sicilian farm life. Perfect for a quiet, relaxing time, as well as brilliantly located for sight seeing. Silvia herself made us feel totally welcome and was really helpful in guiding us and suggesting some great options. A real gem - we'd definitely go back, hopefully for longer!","1428":"We chose Silvia Sillitti's agriturismo for a weekend stay at the end of our recent Sicilian holiday having read previous reviews and we were not disappointed. It is a lovely place in a lovely setting but what makes it special is the friendliness of owners Silvia and Bruno. They are genuinely delighted to welcome guests and ensure that they enjoy their stay - we are not surprised so many keep going back. We feel that we have made new friends in Silvia & Bruno too and look forward to going back as soon as we have an opportunity. We had dinner with them on both evenings. The food was excellent and plentiful. The second evening Silvia agreed to have dinner a little earlier so that our granddaughter (just under 4) could join us even though it meant starting before Bruno got back from work - just one little indicator of how they will put themselves out for guests. Breakfast also good and plentiful with excellent homemade cakes. Super pool and outdoor areas for relaxation with plenty of shade when you need it. Can imagine that if you had only one holiday in Sicily this would be a great location as most sights and coasts within 1\u00bd hour's drive.","1430":"It was hard to find but Silvia picked us up in Caltanissetta and from there it was only a 10 minute drive to the incredible place. It\u2019s a little paradise on earth, really a hidden gem. The panoramic views from the poolside are stunning. The pool, surrounded by flowers and Mediterranean plants is very nice and well maintained. Bruno and Silvia are the perfect hosts. Nothing is too much trouble for them. Here you can really feel the Sicilian hospitality. We stayed in a lovely apartment with two bedrooms and a room with a kitchenette. There is a great and modern shopping center within easy reach of the farm. The breakfast is outstanding with lots of fresh products. The almond cake is to die for. Once we had dinner with Bruno and Silvia. It was superb. The aperitif was served on the terrace, then we had a very typical Sicilian dinner with a lot of fresh products from their own farm. It was a gastronomic delight. We also enjoyed the occasional evening drink with very delicious homemade limoncello, arrancello etc.(Thanks Silvia for the recipe !). Bruno and Silvia, we thoroughly enjoyed our perfect stay at your wonderful agriturismo. Just a pity we couldn\u2019t stay longer. But when we do return to Sicily we will come back. Highly recommended!!","1432":"This hotel is centrally located on a fairly quiet street, at least for Palermo. The price is very reasonable for the quality of the room. Very comfortable and quite friendly staff! I would not hesitate to stay here again. From the hotel, it is an easy walk to the train station and also to multiple good restaurants.","1433":"Big house, comfy room, the best homemade food in Sicily, stunning views and the greatest hosts ever. Silvia and Bruno have a wonderful place up the hill in the heart of the island. 10min drive from Caltanisetta and very close frm main tourist spots of Sicily. It's a perfect option if you rent a car and want to have a nice place where to come back for dinner and sleep after busy days out because you will feel like at home or even if you are looking for some peace and quiet relaxing and eat superb sicilian food. We had a great time at their place, had yummy dinners and enjoyed Silvia and Bruno's company on our dinners too! We just loved it and we are very grateful to them! PS: we bought some yummy organic pasta to cook at home!","1434":"The hotel is built in & over an old building & easy to miss in this street of shops. Stopping on the road is restricted, best get a taxi. Hotel is smart, staff friendly welcoming. We arrived before check in but our room was ready. Theres a short flight of steps to the 3 person lift which only goes to the 5th floor, restaurant bar is on the 7th, so accessibility is minimal. Room 502 is classed as classic double room. On + side, it was clean, noise from street kept away by shutters & 2 sets of windows. Air-con is adequate, a TV with digital channels (no BBC, NBC etc). Good wi-fi. Bed was a double & short, head-board a queen king, so the bed-side tables were a stretch & someone of 6'+ might get cold toes!. Mini-bar noisy during the night & started humming we had to unplug it. Tea coffee making was just 2 tea-bags & sugar. We got coffee & milk at supermarket. Bathroom had no bath but the smallest shower stall! Drop the soap, you have to get out to pick it up! Worst is that 502 is next to the cleaners room. They arrive 7-7:30 & the noise of the trolleys, washing drying machines, is too much to sleep through. Breakfast is basic. Fruit juices, tea coffee. Cold cheeses, cuts, quiche, cereals & bread (too small for toast). Scrambled boiled eggs were only warm item. In the evening we had a drink in the bar before going out to eat. Prices are reasonable & the view spectacular. We didn't try the restaurant but the menu is fish based. Based on the room & accesibility, this is 3 star.","1435":"Our plan was just to find a comfortable spot so that we could visit my mother-in-law's birthplace in San Cataldo. We always wanted to stay on an agriturismo, so this was perfect. We stayed for three nights, using it as a base for visiting San Cataldo, but also Agrigento, etc. The problem was that we didn't want to leave the place! We made sure to get back early enough evening for another of Silvia's exquisite and authentic Sicilian dinners. She shared recipes with my wife and even helped us with our trip to San Cataldo. What a wonderful experience!","1439":"We took the train from the airport and walked straight to the hotel, finding it easily. The location is great for exploring Palermo, being close to the marina, great restaurants and bars. We were welcomed on arrival by a lovely receptionist and found all the staff to be friendly and attentive at all times. Our room was quiet, comfortable and clean. We stayed on a B&B basis and found the breakfast to be a bit basic, missing a selection of bread. Our room was cleaned each day to a high standard. The rooftop terrace is a lovely location for both breakfast and for having a drink at night. We would happily stay in this hotel again.","1440":"We stayed for 4 days and had a wonderful time. Silvia and her husband, Bruno, couldn't have been better hosts. We particularly enjoyed our dinners - excellent food and great company. Sarah and Ed","1442":"I stayed here for a total of three nights. One night I paid out of pocket, and the other two nights were pre-paid since I was here on a Rick Steves Sicily Tour. The room was clean, thick bed sheets, comfortable mattress and the air conditioning worked great. Large bathroom for being in Europe. Excellent staff who will make your stay a memorable one. The views from the roof top restaurant are top notch, bring your camera. The elevator is small so if you have an issue walking up stairs, ask for a room on the first floor, which will actually be on the 2nd floor. The breakfast was fantastic, lot of options, from bacon and eggs to plenty of sweets. Variety of coffee and juices available and included with the breakfast. A safe for valuables is in the room. Dinner was excellent, but a bit pricy. There are more economical selections nearby. I arrived at the Palermo airport and took a public bus which dropped me off about 3 blocks from the hotel. The bus fare was about 12 euro, a lot less than a taxi. You buy your bus ticket by the airport exit entrance.","1443":"Had a wonderful time - sorry the stay could not have been longer. The food was perfect home cooking better than any Hotel, the hosts were perfect attending to every need and nothing was to much trouble. I shall be back for a much longer stay, its a great base to tour from. The home produce is wonderful you must go and stay.","1444":"This farm is one of my favorite places to stay in Sicily, I love staying there, but it's always too short a stay. I hope to visit again in 2011, which will be my 4th trip. Silvia and Bruno are perfect hosts. The farm produces olive oil, almonds and grains, so when you're there be sure to try them and bring them home. There are many places of interest in the area, many good restaurants and shopping centers. I hope Ryanair begins flights from Dublin to Comiso airport -- then perhaps I can visit on weekends!","1446":"Great time to visit Palermo. Not too busy but weather a nice temperature. Hotel is close to train station so an easy 5 to 10 minute walk. Clean and friendly hotel. Good bed and pillow! Great rooftop for drinks, dinner or just a view of the city. We would stay there again.","1447":"Silivia and Bruno made us very welcome on their farm. The views are stunning and the whole area is paradise. It was difficult to drag ourselves away and visit the many sights of the island. This gives us a reason to visit Sicily again. It really is a beautiful island.  You must have a meal with Silvia and Bruno. They are superb hosts and Silvia's cooking is fantastic. She is always pleased to discuss and share her recipes with you. Silvia is also a fountain of knowledge to where to go and what see. Bruno's tour of the farm was also very interesting.  Thank you Silvia and Bruno (not forgetting Lola the pet dog) for 4 wonderful days on your farm. It was fantastico!!","1449":"A gorgeous hotel with a rooftop bar and restaurant overlooking the city. Delicious breakfast with many choices and great bar at night for drinks on the terrace.Our room was comfortable and huge bathroom. The staff was helpful and friendly and spoke English.","1452":"Located a few steps from the Quattro Conti, our room was comfortable, quiet and safe. The staff is able to converse in many languages. The breakfast area on the top floor is superb. Well worth the cost.","1453":"A true family operation. The owners were incredibly helpful, pleasant and personable. The food was outstanding and we now have copied a few of her recipes for ourselves at home. The interactions at meals was true family style and everyone had a great time. We weren't sure what to expect in Sicily but this kind of place would be where we will come back to when we do return to Sicily.","1455":"This is a good hotel in a very convenient location close to the main attractions (catherdral, Ballaro Street Market, Vucciria district, etc.) and the railway station. The hotel is on seven floors with a terrace on the 7th floor which is used for breakfast and dinner. My room was clean and comfortable and the staff are friendly and helpful.","1456":"We have recently returned from the most wonderful stay at Silvia's agriturismo. It is located in the centre of Sicily with the most stunning 360 views. Our hosts, Silvia and Bruno and their daughter, met us in Caltanissetta and escorted us to their farm, at 11.00pm. We were treated like old friends, they were most welcoming. Silvia had prepared a buffet for us which was fantastic, lots of home made delicacies. Silvia and Giusi prepare the most wonderful food for you throughout the week, offering evening meal if you wish. What is special, too, is that Silvia and Bruno will join you at dinner and sometimes their daughter,Chiara, too, to share stories of their life on the farm. Fascinating. To end the meal, we so enjoyed their wonderful home made liqueur. The pool is fantastic and necessary in temperatures of over 40 degress every day. I would like to say that nothing seemed to be too much trouble for Silvia. We enjoyed the occasional evening drink and afternoon cup of tea with her, chatting about life. She was the most gracious host. The farm is very quiet and ideal if you wish to have a relaxing holiday, but also well placed if you wish to explore Sicily. We will treasure our memories of a wonderful week at Agriturismo Sillitti, with Silvia, Bruno, Chiara, Giusi, and not forgetting Lola.","1458":"The hotel has a excellent roof top terrace where you can unwind from a hard day of sightseeing. They provide a reasonable wash, dry and fold laundry service. They are convenient to the train and bus terminal. the rooms are nice.","1459":"We were two couples (sisters and their husbands) on a motoring holiday in Sicily wanting a little bit of peace and relaxation from the stress of everyday life. We certainly found it on Silvia and Bruno's amazing organic farm in Caltanisetta where we had booked in to stay for three nights. We were welcomed into their home like long lost friends and their hospitality knew no bounds. The farm is situated among glorious rolling hills of wheat and corn and numerous olive and almond trees. Everything is grown organically from lentils to chickpeas which are also available for sale. They make their own olive oil and of course we had to have some to take back home! Silvia is a wonderful cook producing a delicious assortment of typical sicilian dishes every night ably assisted by Giusi, and the accent is definitely on healthy eating. Breakfasts were a treat with fresh fruits, homemade jams and a freshly baked cake every morning. Her carrot and almond cake was to die for!!. We had a comfortable two-bedroomed apartment with en-suite facilities and a well equiped kitchenette in which to prepare light meals. The peaceful setting with it's fabulous far reaching views and the huge swimming pool to cool off in after a day's touring coupled with Silvia and Bruno's warm hospitality ensured we had a holiday to remember. Definitely recommended.","1461":"This was my second stay at the hotel and I hope to go back again sometime. The view from the large roof top terrace is fantastic and the terrace itself is nicely designed. The room was ideal and the beds are very comfortable. Also a convenient location. Thanks to Francesca, Greta, Neomi and the hotel management for their kindness shown to my mum after her fall whilst on holiday.","1464":"Silvia, her husband Bruno and their daughter Chiara made us feel welcome from the moment that we arrived at the farm. They went to great lengths to make us feel at home and we were always introduced to her friends and family that visited the farm.  During the course of our stay we were spoilt with homemade delicacies like cassata, marzipan sheep and almond cake. The highlights from our stay included the cooking lessons and organic dinners that Silvia lovingly prepared, with homemade arancello and limoncello amongst others to round off the dinners.  The apartments are well appointed and the facilities make for a relaxing and convenient stay. There are a number of convenient shops and supermarkets within easy reach of the farm.  In summary, Silvia is a thoughtful and gracious host that puts her guests\u2019 interests first. I will definitely recommend Azienda Agricola Silvia Sillitti to those people looking for a more personal touch and some local knowledge for a brief glimpse into the life of true Sicilians.","1466":"We enjoyed our two days at this hotel.Had an inner room which was good since back of hotel near music at night. Room comfortable with nice shower. Highlight is breakfast with spectacular view of Palermo. Location of hotel convenient to the university medical center (20 min walk) and the historic area, as well as the tourist area and restaurants.","1467":"We stayed at Azienda Agricola Silvia Sillitti in October 2009. Ryan Air has made is very cheap to travel from Dublin to Sicily and it has become a favourite of the Irish for short trips and even Wednesday through Sunday excursions.  I read about Agro-Tourism in a newspaper and decided to stay in a farm rather than a hotel. We were very pleased to discover the lovely home of Silvia and Bruno. The views from their farmhouse are wonderful. They have cats and dogs, always a plus. The apartments were large, with full kitchens, clean and new. The baths were a joy after some of the tiny rooms seen in other places.  The mainly grow olives and almonds and they are available to bring home with you.  There is a pool, but we didn\u2019t use it, and instead toured all around the area. Sicily is not very large \u2013 it\u2019s about one third the size of Ireland \u2013 and Azienda Agricola Silvia Sillitti is well-located to explore in any direction.  Silvia is a great cook so when you go there be sure to have one of her dinners.  All in all, an exceptionally pleasant place, the home of an exceptional family. You will like your stay.","1469":"We didn\u2019t stay at this hotel but wanted a roof top terrace in Palermo to appreciate the view. This place was great, excellent views over the city, we stayed for sunset and watched as the city went dark. You must try an Aperol spritz...it\u2019s the thing to do! The only issue was that when we came to pay they had no change at all so we had to leave a rather large tip for 2 drinks!","1470":"We spent 4 days in Silvia's home in October. Really beautiful experience. We enjoyed every minute of it. The dinners that Silvia served were just amazing. We even learnt how to make Silvia's mushroom risotto which we have now tried several times back at home. Sylvia, thanks a lot for everything.","1471":"Me and my boyfriend had an amazing trip to Sicily at the end of August 2009. Part of our holiday was staying in Sillitti's organic farm - a great place to escape from busy London! It is probably silly to travel in Sicily by bus, but thanks to all the friendly people we met it turned out to be great fun!  Silvia picked us up from the bus station as soon as we arrived. Herself and her family were great hosts and made us feel at home with their hospitality and delicious homemade Sicilian food with organic ingredients - olive oil, lentils, cheak peas, tomatoes, olives, courgettes, eggplants, homemade jams and of course homemade wine and limoncello! We stayed in a separate spacious apartment with our own kitchenette so had a chance to cook ourselves delicious food from great Sicilian ingredients bought from authentic market in Palermo!  In spite of the fact we stayed in Sillitti's farm for just 2 days we had a feeling that it was a week as it was so relaxing! We have to mention all friendly dogs and cats they have - great if you are staying there with children! We also had a chance to experience some agriturism by helping Silvia to turn the almonds to dry them - it was truly fun experience! We would love to come back there with our family! Go and stay there, swim in the wonderful pool, look at the beautiful views and enjoy your holiday!","1473":"We had a fantastic familly vacation at Silvia's. Very relaxing. The food that Sylvia cooked was amazing!!! The place is centrally located, very easy to do some day trip around Sicily and come to back to relax in the wonderful pool at the end of the day. We could not asked for a better place to discover Sicily for the first time. We will certainly go back. The whole family simply loved it.  Great for couple and family with kids.","1475":"There is a pub on the ground floor which was very noisy. We had trouble sleeping. We would not choose this hotel again because of the noise. Lovely upstair patio for breakfast with an incredible view of the city.","1476":"The is no better place in Sicily if you are looking for a warm and friendly welcome, a peacefully relaxing holiday in amazing surroundings. Silvia and Bruno have a natural talent for making you feel immediately at home. The views are stunning, Beautiful countryside hills. Our children enjoyed the wonders of the farm, walking around the almond trees, splashing in the pool, looking after the friendly cats and dogs. The location is extremely convenient for exploring all sides of Sicily. You are never more than an hour drive's away from either the coast, the pretty little villages, the mountains of Madonie, etc...Cannot recommend it enough!","1478":"We cannot say enough good about this place. Staff is wonderful and so helpful. The restaurant is amazing and has such a unique menu - not to mention the view of the city from the rooftop. We stay here every time we travel to Sicily.","1479":"We stayed at Sylvia's agriturismo for a week in late June-early July 2009. There were four of us: my 17-year old daughter, 8- and 4-year old sons, and me.  The apartment was great - 2 bedrooms, living space kitchen and bathroom. It was immaculate, and opened up onto a patio area that led right on to a covered area with hammocks, table, ping-pong, and then the pool.  Sylvia afforded the perfect combination of hospitality and respect for privacy. She gave excellent advice in regard to sight-seeing and best driving routes. She and Bruno drove us around the farm and explained the processes from seed to production. The breakfasts were lovely - bread, fruit from the farm, sweet cakes, yogurt, cereal - , the dinner we had was fantastic.  For what we wanted to see in this segment of our 2-week tour of Sicily, the location was excellent. From the farm we traveled easily to Agrigento, Piazza Armerina, Cefalu and Mount Etna, as well as several lesser-touristed sites such as the Castle at Chiaramonte and lots of little villages and towns in the area.  I'd highly recommend Sillitti farm to anyone seeking a relaxing, interesting time getting to know Sicily outside the cities and most touristed areas.","1480":"My first time in Palermo and I picked the ideal hotel. Great value for money. Very attentive staff especially Francesco and Greta who went to great lengths to look after us. I received a lovely card and gift which was very thoughtful","1481":"This is a lovely farm stay in the middle of Sicily, highly recommended as a base equidistant from Mount Etna and Palermo and easy access to the South coast. Silvia and Bruno are fantastic hosts, very generous and great cooks. There's a swimming pool to relax in they'll even teach you to cook pizza if you ask nicely! You can also buy some of their farms products, such as olive oil and olives. Silvia's passion for natural farming was inspiring.  Thanks guys for an amazing stay!","1483":"Only stayed one night but would recommend this hotel. It\u2019s very near to the sights of Palermo and near lots of lovely restaurants. The breakfast on the rooftop had an amazing view of the mountains .Breakfast was nice with a good choice","1484":"Set high in the hills of central Sicily this was a haven from our sometimes frantic touring of Sicily - Palermo etc.  Silvia, Bruno and the 'reception committee' of 2 friendly dogs and many cats are great hosts. They'll also cook you a delicious dinner upon request, using their organic farm produce.","1490":"Silvia\u2019s bio farm  After some days city sightseeing and driving around the island of Sicily in May 2009, we took a deep breath and relaxed in Silvia\u2019s farm Azienda Agricola Sillitti. The bio farm, used also as small hotel with 15 sleeping places, is in the middle of green fields and almonds trees. Silvia\u2019s and Bruno\u2019s farm is close to Caltanissetta which is in the middle of the island. It is a perfect place to have a rest after days of driving and city sightseeing. The farm has nice swimming pool especially appreciated by families with children. The cats and the two friendly dogs around are also part of the warm welcome atmosphere. The place is certainly good to escape from the stress of the everyday \u201cnormal\u201d life. The friendly owners, their bio products and the tasty healthy breakfast make the stay in Sillitti farm quite pleasant and relaxing. After saying Goodbye to Silvia and Bruno, we thought we could stay longer. Martin, Anahit and Lusin,Brussels","1504":"Our room had a good size, was comfortable, and the air conditioning was perfect. However, the bathroom had some problems. The shower head was not working well as the water was going away through the chain; low pressure and slow drainage too. The sink faucet was also spitting out the water in an unpleasant way. We enjoyed the good breakfast on the wonderful roof terrace. The hotel staff were very nice and efficient in helping us with obtaining the car driving pass for the ZTL-zone.","1507":"We stayed at Ambasciatori for one night only and were delighted to find such a cool spot in a great location. The hotel is located in a beautiful building and the rooms are spacious and decorated with an artful feel. It's situated nicely within walking distance of great restaurants and some of the city's best highlights. The breakfast was lovely and the terrace offered a breathtaking view of Palermo. We had a nice time, and I would definitely recommend. Staff are all very friendly and helpful. Great value and overall very nice experience. I do want to reiterate what the others have said about Palermo: don't drive if you don't have to!","1509":"Nice hotel in the city center with a Lovely terrass to enjoy the breakfast. The breakfast had a good choice and was very tasteful. Nice and helpful staff. Walking distance to city center and markets. 2 free parking lots.","1512":"This hotel has a lot going for it. Our standard room was rather large with a spacious bathroom. Our room and the hotel in general is clean and well maintained and noise was not an issue internally or from the main street it is situated on. The staff was friendly and responsive and spoke sufficient English. A wonderful breakfast with a large selection of items is included and takes place on the hotel\u2019s very lovely rooftop terrace. The terrace has a spectacular 180\u00b0 view of the city, cathedrals and backing mountains and both early morning and late evening are very special times to be up there. The hotel\u2019s location is an easy walk to many attractions and has a bus stop out front for getting to the beach (30 min. \u20ac1.40). A very well stocked and useful grocery store is only 200 m away. Several nearby side streets have a very lively night-life with dozens or even hundreds of people happily milling about eating, drinking and socializing well into the evening. It\u2019s quite appealing to witness even if it\u2019s not really your type of thing and not a problem in terms of noise. This hotel is an excellent option.","1515":"A modernized hotel in an old building. The room we were in faced the back with a view towards the harbor and had a safe and modern bathroom. Also double windows with shutters. The real bragging right is of the rooftop terrace. The views are glorious; we enjoyed beautiful sunny mornings and evenings as well as watched some thunder storms blow through.","1518":"Very good location. The view from the Terrace is gorgeous, nice breakfast included in price. I would stay again in same hotel. Very friendly welcome. Room was spacious and clean, love the pillows and the access to electrical outlets","1527":"I was impressed by the quality of the accommodations. I'd stayed there about ten years ago and they've since renovated and the rooms are even nicer. The building dates from about 1900: an older building with character and history (antique cage elevator with manual-close doors) but modern large rooms with high ceilings. The selling point is the fabulous rooftop terrace with three separate seating areas. The largest overlooks the city and a smaller lounge area overlooks the port with views to the water. The hotel has added two indoor rooftop seating areas where dinner is served. We had a large (200sf) double room on the fifth floor with an ample bathroom. Although too hot to leave the windows open the room did have cross ventilation (bedroom windows overlooking the city and bathroom window facing an interior light well). The air conditioning worked great. The reception and breakfast staff couldn't have been nicer. We found free parking on the street about a block from the hotel and later, during a festival, we moved the car to a nearby garage. The breakfast was great with both savory and sweet options. The hotel is located right on the via Roma and is perfectly located at the center of the city with most historic sites within 15-minute walk (from the Norman Palace at one end to the Foro Italico at the other). There are great local restaurants nearby ranging from casual street food to high-end restaurants. I'd definitely stay there again on a future visit.","1529":"Lovely old hotel with very good staff. Rooms are a bit dated but clean and safe. Dining is fancy and in a beautiful dining hall with very well presented dishes of food. Breakfasts are good value. 20 mins walk down to the centre of Ortega or take the red bus ticket price \u20ac5 for all day goes off around 8pm","1537":"Book early as this is a good value hotel for Palermo. Staff is professional and available. Rooftop breakfast is extraordinary. We also enjoyed the same rooftop for our evening aperitifs and spritzes. There was a Rick Steves tour group staying here at the same time as our visit and apparently it is on most tour itineraries. Room was comfortable with a good shower and mattress. AC was cold and wonderful after hot days in Palermo. If rooms are available I recommend you book it. We stayed two nights after landing at the Palermo airport - wish we had stayed longer.","1538":"My husband and I arrived in Palermo for the start of a two week Sicily trip. This hotel got us off to a great start with a super convenient location, wonderful breakfasts with fantastic views of Palermo, and a wonderfully helpful and friendly staff. They are doing some remodeling which will make this an even better choice in the future!","1541":"Scary and unfriendly reception dark and unwelcoming. Leaving key every time you leave is annoying and un necessary. Thank goodness we only stayed one night. I will tell everyone to stay away ! Even breakfast that they put in a bag( since we paid) they could only put ONE fruit for two people!","1544":"Really enjoyed our stay here. Excellent location - feels like a ten minute walk to everything (the train station, all the tourist attractions, great restaurants are less than a 5 minute walk away).  We payed a bit extra for the premier room. Nice big ceilings and felt spacious. We couldn\u2019t hear much noise at all from the road, there\u2019s 3 different doors to block it out from the balcony so it wasn\u2019t an issue.  The front of house staff were very friendly and polite - Greta and I forget the other ladies\u2019 names, but they were all very helpful.  Great view from the breakfast bar restaurant upstairs, hard to beat.  Good chance we\u2019ll come back here.","1547":"It\u2019s a nice enough inner city hotel. Great location and that\u2019s really what you\u2019re paying for. The rooms are large but essentially quite basic. Little luxury but have everything you need. The staff are...a range. Some helpful, some dismissive. Greta was lovely. The breakfast was pretty ordinary. Good awful coffee. Surely there\u2019s no reason for this in Italy?? But served on their lovely rooftop terrace with amazing view. Really no complaints but know that you\u2019re paying for the location.","1550":"Quaint hotel in downtown Palmera. Close to everything. Rooms facing street can be a bit noisy. Very attentive staff. Wonderful rooftop bar, best place to take a meal or drink. I little tricky to find at first because they are in the middle of the block and have a small sign.","1553":"We were there only for a day and it did leave a good impression. The rooms are big enough for city hotel in that location and had all the nice touches like proper soap and shampoo associated with a bigger chain hotel.  The location is what stood out for me. Within 10 minutes walk and there are many restaurants and bars just ask the reception for a map. Also just a short walk down and across the road from the hotel there is a mini market selling water and convenience items.  If you dont want to go far, the roof top bar and restaurant has a beautiful view of the city.  Car parking is in the street behind the hotel and the entrance is easy to miss it does not even have a parking sign at the entrance from the main street.","1556":"Good location right in the centre of the city, but very noisy as our room was above the street. Clean, the decoration is rather simple. The good surprise was for the breakfast on the top roof with amazing views on Palermo.","1558":"This hotel is making many improvements. The rooftop terrace is wonderful. We had breakfast and drinks up there. They were going to open the restaurant a couple weeks after our visit. I am sure it will be wonderful. They were working on several more rooms. The room we had was spacious with a modern bathroom. They also have air conditioning and sound proof windows which many old buildings do not. I would highly recommend this hotel.","1564":"Everyone talks about the rooftop terrace and bar and for good reason. It's spectacular! The location is also ideal for touring Palermo.  I thought the rooms were below 4 star standard, but there was a lot of construction and renovation in process, and I would not be surprised if the hotel looks a lot nicer in the near future. I would stay here again, at any rate.","1568":"Stayed for 3 nights. Room was OK with good bed but the stay in this hotel was made great by the quality of front desk employees and the magnificent view from the rooftop bar and breakfast area. On the front desk, Francesca, Greta and Enzo were incredibly responsive and helpful. A real bonus when staying in a complex town like Palermo. The rooftop bar and breakfast area was amazing with changing views between day and night. Very good service from friendly people.","1571":"Not only was the rooftop venue very special, the attendants at the front desk and in the bar were helpful & kind. Our room though fronting on a busy street was relatively quiet thanks to interior shutters, insulated drapes, and new windows. The high ceilings and bathroom fixtures were all pluses.","1576":"I recently stayed at the Ambasciatori for three nights. It was my second visit. I chose it based on the central location, a few blocks from the train station, a few minutes from the Quattro Canti, the Ballaro market, and walking distance to the Norman Palace & cathedral. I also love the night life in the back streets towards Piazza Marina. We had a lovely dinner at Garaffo in Piazza Marina one of the nights. The roof top bar is a huge amenity, although getting up to it would be difficult if you have any mobility issues as you have to go up stairs. But once up there the view can't be beat. It is a peaceful oasis and a great place to relax. Breakfast is also served there. The layout of the hotel is a bit quirky, but I found the staff to be efficient and helpful. The room was fine. In my twin room there were two beds, a mini fridge, bathroom had toiletries and adequate space. Shower drain was a little slow - I might have mentioned it if I'd stayed longer. Everything was clean and pleasant. We had a balcony. The main street is very noisy, but I enjoyed people watching. The windows are effectively sound proof if you close them. The breakfast was fine. I was very happy with my stay. You also do have to go up stairs to access the elevator, and the elevator is old fashioned. But this was not a problem for my friends and I.","1578":"DO NOT RECOMMEND!  We stayed here for 3 nights on our honeymoon. All I can say is that anywhere would be better than here. Some of the staff at reception were very rude! On the second day the WiFi wasn't working at all on our floor. The lady at reception kept saying she would get her colleague to fix it... That didn't happen. Eventually we begged for a different room. She put us on the 6th floor. She did not help us move, instead gave us the key to go see if the WiFi worked there ourselves. Also my family is Sicilian and I understood most of what she said to her colleague about us. If I hadn't been sick I might have said something about that but I instead pretended to be a stupid tourist. Very rude!  The elevator only goes to level 5 so my husband had to get both bags up the extra flight of stairs. Also the elevator only fits 2 people and one bag at most. To make things worse the noise on that floor for all the people going up the stairs to breakfast in the morning was awful. The breakfast was very average. The only good thing was the location. Would never return!","1583":"Perfect hotel for your first night in Palermo. The rooms are spacious and enjoying breakfast on the terrace is a perfect introduction to the city. Will definitely stay here again. Avoid other hotels such as the Ibis. Chain disappointments with shabby interiors.","1586":"The Ambasciatori Hotel was very near the railroad station - a straight shot. The check-in was quick and seamless. He recommended a very good tratorria near by for dinner. We had a nice breakfast on the rooftop, with a great view and then moved on. It was less than 24 hours, but quite nice.","1589":"If ever in the area would use again for convenient location and hospitable staff. Definitely a business district bustling with traffic both vehicles and human. So walkable you won\u2019t regret. The price was reasonable as it was shoulder.","1592":"Booked this hotel for the view from the rooftop terrace, and proximity to railway station. We arrived at 11pm, so good to be able to walk to the hotel. The view from the rooftop terrace is outstanding, and fascinating. We loved trying to work out where things were from the elevated perspective. The room was large and clean, the bed comfortable. Easy to walk from here to many places. We enjoyed our four night stay, and the historic elevator. Make sure you close the doors when you leave it though - it doesn\u2019t work otherwise!","1604":"The hotel is located steps from Old City and most tourist attractions. The view from the restaurant is incredible!! The room is good size and the bathroom is quite large. They have their own parking lot, which is just down the block. I will definitely stay here again.","1791":"Wonderfully designed rooms, great beds, lovely full breakfast. Great location, easy walkability - located three minutes from beach and town. In-house host creates welcoming environment, helpful with anything you need!","1794":"We had a fantastic three nights stay at BB Mondello Design. Roberta is a marvellous host, we felt part of her life, born and raised in Sicily, perfectly adapted to the region for the lenght of our holidays and beyond. BB Mondello boutique lies in our hearts since our first step into the decorated lounge with seasonal tree and lights. Upgraded to the Suite AKKURA for free, cuddled in fantastic daily breakfast and chats. We will never stop thanking for this Christmas Holidays! Grazie","1798":"This 1880 property is amazing. Very calm, nicely rebuilt interiors, incredible gardens and above all, great service! We've just spent one night but wished to stay more. I would like many 5 star hotels I've visited to be as good as this one. All staff was always around ready to fulfill every need. Definitely a great choice!","1802":"Had such a fabulous few days staying at this B and B. Roberta made all of us feel so welcome and was full of energy and enthusiasm! The B and B was in the perfect location, close to the beach and restaurants. Amazing breakfasts and lovely rooms. My children wanted homemade cakes for breakfast when they got back home to the UK! I\u2019m missing the pistachio croissants! Thank you, Roberta, for being such a caring and effusive host!","1805":"everything is excellent - place, rooms, breakfast, area, beach, sea, weather and my warmest wishes to Roberta )) would be happy to come again next year during spring or summer period, but even in October weather is nice.","1806":"We had a great stay at B&B Mondello Design. Roberta was very helpful and kind. She made dinner reservations for us at a great restaurant including transportation She supplied a great breakfast and was kind enough to share a recipe. The room and bath was clean and comfortable, There was a beautiful spiral staircase that lead to the rooms. The location was walking distance to the beach and a bus ride to Palermo. We would recommend this B and B.","1807":"A wonderfully villa, located outside the city, you will need a car if you want to enjoy the vacation, to explore the city or the island. Lovely renovated villa with very large and nice rooms, with a brilliant breakfast room, an amazing pool, an beautiful view, with a very nice garden with palm trees, orange trees and olive trees. You can also enjoy launch or dinner only if you notice them in the morning. Also they have a nice parking place for cars, with the necessary shadow for summer time. The staff is very polite and usefully and I want to thanks all of them for making our stay very nice. All the villa is very clean always and the cleaning staff is doing an amazing job including our room. The only minus was an aggressive old lady, I believe to be the manager or one of the owners. If it\u2019s the manager they should fire her immediately because of her behavior to customers. If she\u2019s an owner than she should immediately let the staff to manage the business. We had a great stay for 5 nights to this amazing villa.","1809":"We started our twelve night stay in Sicily at B&B Mondello Design. We ended our stay there as well. It was our favorite place out of seven places we stayed. The owner Roberta is a absolute gem...from our first e-mail to her, our check in for our first stay and welcome back for our last stay. She was so helpful and provided us with information about the area and made reservations for our dinners. The B&B is modern, beautifully designed, clean and very comfortable! Both times our room was spacious, beautiful, clean and extremely comfortable. The bathroom was huge, sparkling clean with a spacious shower. The towels were the softest we had in all of Sicily. We appreciated the attention to detail provided such as slippers, beach towels, wine glasses and tea service in our room. The mattress and the pillows were very comfortable! Our breakfasts were delicious with a nice assortment of meats, cheeses, bread, pastries, fresh fruits, plus a freshly baked cake each morning, plus the best Cappuccino in all of Sicily! The B&B is located a short walk to the beautiful sandy beach and cute town. I would highly recommend B&B Mondello Design and look forward to going back some day!","1828":"This is such a perfect place. The location 2 mns from the sea is ideal, the rooms are huge and spotlessly clean, breakfast was scrumptious and the host Roberta is warm hearted and full of tips and contacts. Our room was on the first floor on the garden and was simply huge and full of small amenities such as slippers, towels for the beach, tea making service. The breakfast is truly delicious with cake still piping hot from the oven and fresh scrambled eggs. Roberta is cheerful and goes out of her way to book restaurants and taxis. The restaurant she suggested was perfect and better than all the ones we tried later. This is really much more than a B&B more like a small luxury hotel..","1835":"From the moment Roberta opened the gate we knew we had found a perfect place to stay. Roberta was a wonderful hostess and could not do enough for us. Our rooms were spotless and comfortable. Breakfast was a delight, fresh baked cake each morning, delicious omelettes fresh fruits and tasty treats. The beach is just a short walk away. Roberta gave us great recommendations for things to do. She also arranged for a superb restaurant to pick us up and bring us back after a great meal. The house keeper Patricia was very helpful and friendly. We really felt we were with family.","1838":"and a wonderfully warm hostess, Roberta, come to Mondello Design. What a wonderful place. We had a pretty room with a view of the mountain . Roberta took care of everything in a calm and friendly way. Incredibly efficient, friendly and fun. A couple blocks to walk to the beach and great restaurants. Roberta\u2019s driver Adriano is also wonderful and took us to a few day excursions. I couldn\u2019t believe the different delicious home made cake surprise each day , along with a great breakfast. We enjoyed coming back to the B N B and Mondello after busy days in Palermo. Thank you Roberta and Adriano Paul and Kathy from California","1844":"We choose it for our honeymoon and it was perfect - the room was clean and well-designed (true to the photos), equipped with everything we needed. Location is great: close to the sea, about several minutes walk, and the water was crystal clear. Historical city of Palermo is in 15 min drive or about 30 min by direct bus. Special thanks to our host Roberta, she did her best to help us spend the perfect vacation!","1850":"Beautiful facility with outstanding service. Everyone went out of their way to take care of us, from meeting us at the front door, setting up chaise and towels at pool, and getting us extra pillows. Turns out we were the only guests at the hotel and we were treated like royalty. When we found out the chef was not available for dinner, they ordered for us from a restaurant and served us in the dining room. We met the owner who deserves credit for building a first class facility and hiring a first class staff. They are set up to do weddings there and can imagine how wonderful experience that would be. Nice assortment for breakfast as well.","1851":"What can I say? We absolutely loved our time spent at B&B Mondello Design! Roberta, the owner and her wonderful staff went above and beyond to make sure we had the perfect stay and we did. Every morning a lovely breakfast with meats, cheeses, pastries and cakes Roberta baked herself. Always cheerful and delightful, Roberta gave us a great itinerary every day. Our room was absolutely spotless and very welI maintained. You will not be disappointed at B&B Mondello Design! We will definitely be back!","1868":"A large, modern hotel on the edge of town, used mostly by Italians, but good for tourists as a base for the Enna area. Good parking. Large well appointed rooms, and a good breakfast. The restaurant (closed Sundays) served excellent pasta and meat courses, the steak being very tender. Good Syrah wine from Erice. The staff were very friendly and gave us a complementary digestivo.","1879":"This is a beautiful place to stay. The rooms are beautifully designed and kept immaculate. Roberta is an amazing host - she organised for Adriano to collect me from the airport and he was very friendly and helpful. She makes a fantastic breakfast and takes a lot of trouble to make sure that you know where places are and any information you need. She's also just fun and friendly and always makes you feel very welcome and at home. The location is great - just a couple of minutes walk from the beach and Roberta helped me to book a sunbed online and when that was not possible for one day because I arrived on a very busy bank holiday she managed to arrange for another guest to give me their pass for the day as they were out sailing. She also let me use her bathroom to change in on my last day after I checked out. You literally couldn't wish for a better host. I was a bit nervous about travelling on my own but she made me feel very comfortable and relaxed.","1890":"Great place! Comfortable, cosy and good positioned. Additional thanks to Roberta for hospitality and great follow up of our requests! If once we come back to mondello we will surely come back to this B&B  Olga","1911":"The location is very good, at just a few meters from the best part of Mondello beach and from some of the best locations for eating drinking. The suites are very spacious and well designed (forniture and decoration). We are a family with two toddlers (5 and 3) and were very comfortable with the disposition of the beds, and the semi-separation between two areas of the room. The bathroom is comfortable and spacious as well, especially the shower. The owner, Roberta, is a fantastic host. She will make you feel at home with her breakfast (especially her cakes), the good tips she gives, and the nice conversations. All in all, this is a great place to stay at Mondello.","1916":"Dear Roberta! We left your lovely place 8 hours ago and we already miss... -you -your warmth and your smile -your lovely, modern, comfortable and clean rooms -your beautiful breakfast filled with homemade (and everyday special homemade) cakes, fruits, bread and omelette! -your happiness and personal engagement -your honesty and positivity!  Roberta is a one if a kind host that never stops until you are happy and confident. Actually she is the natural born hostess that could take courses in how to run and design a B&B! A great location too, with short distance to the sea. Ps- use the free bikes to move around.  We promise to return one day, lovely Roberta!","1918":"This is a modern, clean & very comfortable B&B. I'd highly recommend here if visiting Mondello. We had a suite that slept 4. The rooms are spacious & beautifully decorated with modern fittings. The beach is a short walk (2 mins) from the B&B so no need for a pool. The beach is gorgeous & sea crystal clear. Bars, water sports & facilities to fill your day. Roberta was very helpful on arrival. Showed as a map & marked restaurants, bars etc. Breakfast had a very good selection. We went out on the bikes to visit friends in the other two hotels. We rated here above the hotels (they were dated). Very pleased to have found this B&B.","1925":"Situated in a quiet street, 100 metres from the best part of the beach in Mondello. The rooms are spacious and well equipped and I probably had the best nights sleep when staying away from home. Roberta the owner is a real joy. Nothing is too much trouble. She arranged our day trip to Palermo. But the highlight was her breakfast each day. Plentiful with lots of choice. Her scrambled egg and her home made cakes were especially tasty. Plus, a special mention to Abertino our taxi driver who Roberta arranged to pick us up drop off at Palermo airport. Probably the nicest and friendliest taxi driver I have ever met. He went out of his way to show us the best restaurants and bars to try in Mondello. Ask Roberta to book him for you if you need taxi service. Overall, this b&b deserves it's no 1 position on TA.","1926":"If you're planning a trip to Mondello, this is THE place to stay. Roberta's hospitality is nothing I've ever experienced before. She is positive, welcoming and emanates such a great energy. She cares about each guest, recommending what she thinks their group would best enjoy. The property is gorgeous and so well taken care of with an AMAZING breakfast every morning. The location is great, walkable to beaches and restaurants. Do yourself a favor and book B&B Mondello Design! It will be a highlight of your trip.","1929":"This is an excellent small hotel. Roberta is rightly very proud and very helpful and a natural host. Great room , comfortable bed , lovely en suite. We stayed early July and is was very hot but the whole place is well air conditioned. The breakfasts are excellent and far better than most upmarket hotels as they are very fresh. If you are going to stay in Mondello stay here.","1933":"Mondello Design was the perfect place to stay during our trip to Sicily. Roberta treated us to a wonderful breakfast every morning (fresh cake each day, cold meats cheese, selection of pastries, fresh fruit, espresso to name a few items). In addition to the amazing food, Roberta was an extremely attentive host who gave excellent recommendations for restaurants, day trips etc and went out of her way to help us with reservations. The room was beautifully decorated, very clean and well air conditioned. The B&B is close to the beach with easy access to the town. I wish I could give more than 5 stars!","1939":"We just returned from a 2 week holiday in Sicily. We stayed at Mondello Design 2 nights at the beginning of our trip and 1night at the end of our trip. Our sightseeing centered around Palermo &Cefalu. When I made the hotel reservation I didn't realize it was a 20 minute drive to Palermo. But it turned out to be a positive mistake because after 2 long hot days of sightseeing it was very pleasant to come back to this B&B. The room we had was spacious, modern and clean, very comfortable.The name of our room was Mizzica, & I noticed its the room pictured on the website. Request this one if you can!  Roberta the proprietor, does an excellent job! She is fun, engaging and energetic. She really does make a good effort making her guests feel welcome,& she is willing to help with any necessary details. She recommended restaurants to us each evening and all were terrific. Honestly, the food & gelato in Mondello was the best we had on our trip! Roberta's breakfast on the terrace was very good, too, with fruit, eggs and assorted freshly baked goods.  Mondello is a busy beach town in the summer. This B&B is just a block from the beach & it was fun to just walk around & be part ion the scene for a bit. The Sicilian people are among the nicest we have encountered in our extensive travels.","1942":"We have just spent 4 nights in beautiful Mondello at the Mondello Design b&B. We have no hesitation in recommending this place to anyone who is planning to visit Palermo. Everything about the b&b is top quality and the hostess Roberta is so charming and nothing is too much trouble for her. Breakfast on the terrace has an excellent selection, including continental and sweet selection. Fantastic place!!","1944":"We stayed at Mondello design for 3 nights in June. The B&B is located in a side street just 3 minutes from the beach in the pleasant but somewhat busy Beach town of Mondello. We didn\u2019t come for the beach per se, but it was nice to stroll along the beach and enjoy the many bars and restaurants there. The beach itself is wide and long with white sand but seemed very busy while we were there. We used the BB as a basis for some day trips to Palermo, Cefal\u00f9 and Monreale. There is a hop on hop off bus nearby, which makes those trips easy if you don\u2019t want to drive. We came by car and parking on the street can be difficult, but you can park in the driveway of the BB as well. There are many good restaurants in walking distance and Roberta provides good advice and makes reservations. The rooms are bright, very nicely decorated and clean, with all the amenities you need (next to tea some instant coffee in the room would have been nice). Free water and relatively good WiFi. Roberta is a perfect host. Nothing is too much and she goes out of her way to help with anything you need, with exuberant energy. The breakfast on the terrace in the morning is a real treat, with a variety of freshly prepared cakes and pastries, breads, cereal, fruits, egg dishes, and great coffee. We truly enjoyed our stay and felt welcome and at home in B&B Mondello design.","1955":"The B&B is small and personal. Roberta who runs it, is lively, fun and very obliging. She is able help with all kinds of things. She has tickets for the hop on-hop off buses into Palermo, good information about the restaurants and bars nearby and really good ideas for the beach. It's very reassuring to have such an effective person delivering really useful help with a light touch. Nothing is too much trouble.  We were able to park the car in her driveway which was very useful given the usual busy on street parking in the high season.  Breakfast is buffet style and interesting as each day there was an option to try something new. On day 1 we had homemade cakes and on day 2 we had crepes. The coffee is excellent.  The rooms are all given names in Sicilian dialect. Ours was called ammuni which means let's go. It's a very nice touch. It was airy and bright with a balcony. There was plenty space. The walk in shower is sumptuous and the bed large and comfortable. There is a minibar and a kettle. Again , really excellent. Wifi signal is strong too. Excellent place and super host!","1964":"We had such an amazing time during our stay in Mondello - Sicily. By far B&B Mondello design is the best choice for those who wish to have a TOP NOTCH service. The rooms are very comfortable, clean and very stylish as well. Not to mention our host Roberta who is always very kind, very helpful and very smiling! It is not a surprise that B&B Mondello Desing is the #1 in Italy!! Keep up the awesome work Roby!! Wish you all the best and I really hope to see you and Mondello soon!!","1982":"A beautiful new hotel right on the main pedestrian-only route in downtown Palermo. Room was spotless and very quiet. Entire hotel was in impeccable condition. Wi-fi was strong & fast. Breakfast was excellent by Sicilian standards. Bed was very comfortable for both my partner & I even though we have different firmness preferences. Honestly, I can't imagine finding a better place to stay if you are visiting Palermo. Book it.","1985":"The hotel itself is a beautiful nine room hotel in the historic walking area. I was there off season and the only guest my first night there. The staff was friendly, attentive and helpful every day. The modern rooms were spread out providing privacy. Each room requires a fair number of steps to reach.","2008":"This is a hidden gem. It is just off the main street right in the heart of the old town. The service was some of the very best that we experienced in our entire stay in Sicily. The rooms were spacious, immaculate as well as charming. I loved the breakfast and the breakfast area. I would recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Palermo. It has beautiful rooms, so get a reservation, and remember there are some stairs to navigate. Enjoy this gem.","2011":"We loved this place and not just because of its perfect location just steps away from the major attractions and great restaurants. Our room was spacious, very well designed, nicely furnished, and quiet - overlooking the main pedestrian street helps! Also a great bathroom. The staff members were also great, especially the charming front desk guy, who spoke very good English and French and was really helpful with recommendations and directions. He even went out of his way to help me get my shoes repaired! Breakfast was perfect with great food, coffee and service.","2016":"Had difficulty checking in as the night manager did not speak any english and google translate evidently doesn't work as well as one hoped. There is no dedicated parking for the hotel. Had a hard time logging into the wifi. The hallways and staircases are narrow and quite dark. Overall, not worth the price.","2023":"This small boutique hotel is located in the heart of the pedestrian streets of Palermo, just a block from its fantastic cathedral. The room we had was fantastic - very spacious, comfortably decorated, a great bathroom and a small balcony at the front of the building overlooking the streets below. The staff are marvellous - booked us three great restaurants to eat at. They serve a huge breakfast in the morning and it is great fun to get to know the other guests who are also staying there and compare notes on day trips. The location is great and the hotel is very well run.","2026":"We truly enjoyed our stay at the Natoli which came at the end of a 3 week trip. The hotel is quite small but beautifully finished. There isn't an elevator but the porters will carry your bags so no worries. Our room overlooked the main street where we enjoyed seeing 2 different processions during our stay. Surprisingly with the insulating windows and shutters the room was relatively quiet although we did hear the teenagers going to school in the mornings during the week. The room itself had a small balcony and was on a corner so there was plenty of light. Plus, the room was very spacious and the bathroom was in a contemporary style with plenty of room. The shutters and light curtain provided plenty of privacy. The concierge front desk staff were very helpful arranging taxi's, recommending restaurants, sights, etc. The breakfast provided is adequate and the breakfast area is small but comfortable. We were very pleased with our stay and would recommend the Natoli for visitors to Palermo.","2029":"We loved this hotel. It made our stay in Palermo Wonderful room, location. Like being with family. Special mention of Andrea. Great person. We had a medical issue and he used all of his resources to Help us out. All ended well Wonderful staff in a wonderful hotel. We miss it already.","2037":"Lovely small boutique hotel in the centre of old Palermo town - the cathedral and all the main tourist sights are within a few minutes\u2019 walking distance and there are some great restaurants and bars on your doorstep.  The hotel is an old palazzo that has been beautifully and sympathetically renovated - stylish and elegant, a perfect blend of old and new. We stayed in room 7 which has a spacious shower room, a good sized bedroom (with a very comfy bed) and a small balcony with a table for 2.  Breakfast is served in the lovely bright downstairs dining room. There is a wide range of carefully prepared sweet and savoury Sicilian breakfast treats to feast on (as well as the more traditional breakfast fare of cereals, fruit and eggs) and fresh tea and coffee - it\u2019s well worth getting up for.  The staff are very friendly and professional. Fluent in English (as well as other languages) they will offer all the help and assistance that you might need. Ask for recommendations on where to have dinner, or to take the aperitvo, and they will come up with some great suggestions. We loved our stay in the heart of this intriguing city.  Highly recommended.","2038":"Even before we arrived, we were impressed by the quality of the assistance received from Signor Andrea, who speaks several languages fluently. One of us had had unexpected health challenges and needed a health-related device made available during our stay. Nothing was too much trouble for Signor Andrea. When something went wrong with it, he went out of his way to get things fixed quickly. It was like having the services of a top concierge.  Check in was friendly and quick, in the small reception area. We were offered tea, coffee, water, even a local liquor. This centrally located building is not suitable for the mobility impaired as there is no lift and some of the stairs are steep.  The apartment was clean, spacious and fairly quiet, with windows onto a blank wall across an alley. The flooring throughout was elegant, matt charcoal tiling. It was about 35C in the daytime and the a c was excellent.  There was a good, 4* bathroom with a large shower (both rain shower-head and hose shower), bidet and toiletries. Good towels but not replaced during our 3 nights.  There was also a good kitchen with oven, stove cooker, fridge freezer and even a small dishwasher. Basics like plates, cups, glasses, cutlery, washing up liquid and sponge were provided but no kitchen towel. Also, we noticed just one pan, so any eating-in would have to be snacks or picnic type or perhaps delivered meals.  Our favourite object was the Nespresso machine; some coffee pods for this were provided (we had also brought along our own preferred pods), as well as a small selection of tea bags, all complimentary.  Soft drinks and bottles of wine in the fridge came with a price list. A 1 2 litre complimentary bottle of water was placed on each bedside table on arrival but not replenished. There is an alimentary less than 2 minutes away.  Our spacious bedroom (or studio) had a student-type basic sofa and a reasonably comfortable but cheap bed mattress, a large wardrobe and other 3* furniture. The only chairs were the economy fold-up wooden type. Bedding pillows sheets were medium quality and also not changed during our stay, although the apartment was cleaned daily.  The breakfast room on the ground floor, off the small reception foyer, looked elegant but was cramped when full. A generous buffet of medium quality ingredients was available, including some cut-up melons and pineapple, some cold cuts and cheese, hard boiled eggs and congealed scrambled eggs, and a large choice of pastries and tarts (some were stale), also juices and cereals. Coffee of your choice was served to your table by a pleasant young lady.  The best ice cream place in town was recommended by the hotel: Cappadonia, around the corner. We also lunched right next door at the good value Caffe del Kassaro which opens at 7am for coffee and sandwiches pastries - lunch is from about 12noon but there is a permanent queue there, from 12.50pm until they close at about 3.30pm, so get there earlier.  At 250\u20ac a night, this aparthotel seemed overpriced (mainly because of the ikea type furniture in the apartment, which really brought down the overall quality) but then \u201coverpriced\u201d is our general impression of this island. Taxi from the airport took about 25 minutes and cost an eye watering 50\u20ac, for example.  We can certainly consider coming back to Palazzo Natoli if we return to Palermo. We don\u2019t usually notice specific staff but, although we would normally grade this place as 4 5, the helpfulness and friendliness of the staff and especially Signor Andrea raised it to 5 5.","2043":"We really enjoyed our stay at Palazzo Natoli. One of the rare hotels that provides a clean, modern look while still having lots of character. Perfect location in the old town. The staff was also extremely helpful when my wife's luggage was delayed and had great recommendations for around the town! Also, a fantastic price for the value.","2045":"Palazzo Natoli is the existential proof of Palermo Rebirth.! The Boutique Hotel located centrally is perfect for feeling Sicily and Palermo from day one. It is so close to everything, and it is facing the main Corso. Staff was super friendly and super helpful (both Andrea and Mario in particular),and they helped us to come with the car, which was kind of an adventure per se. The Hotel Palace is decorated and kept well in every single detail. I don't forget to mention the wonderful sicilian Breakfast! Simply go for it!","2049":"Spent the weekend with friends for a local wedding. Good and clean hotel near the city centre. Rooms and bathroom are very large. Lot of noise from the streets and breakfast served only till 9am are two downsides. Price is definitely fair. Very friendly hotel receptionist. Fit for purpose lodging!","2056":"Tiny boutique hotel, simple, but cute and comfortable, with modern amenities, and well located. Lobby is tiny, but our room was spacious and comfortable. Location is on a popular pedestrian street that can be loud at night, but I'd still recommend it. Breakfast was a huge spread and delicious.  Francesca the concierge literally saved our entire trip to Sicily by helping us deal with Alitalia to locate our lost luggage. She worked tirelessly for 24+ hrs with impossible Alitalia to help locate the luggage. She was super patient and kind, spoke perfect English, also provided good recommendations for Palermo. Mario was not as helpful with his English, but also very kind and tried to help.  Thank you, Francesca, for saving our trip, we cannot thank you enough!  Pro tip - the gelato place across the street from the hotel is divine. Enjoy!","2057":"Old town, very noisy. The bath was okay, except the shower was slippery. A double-glass door opened onto the Fiat-wide street below. Don't Sicilians know to stop yelling when people are trying to sleep. The Breakfast room, on the top floor gave a panoramic view of the city. The food was tasty.","2058":"We toured around Sicily and this was our favourite stay. Andrea was so welcoming, we couldn\u2019t have asked for more - he took the time to plan a little walking tour of Palermo for us directing us to the best sights and places for a glass of vino! He even met us at our car and helped us with our luggage through the back streets of Palermo. The rooms are gorgeous and we enjoyed sitting out on a balcony in the evening. Extensive choice of local delicacies for breakfast and again the staff were so friendly. It really was perfect and I can\u2019t recommend it enough!","2063":"The perfect place to stay in Palermo Old town. Perfect spot near all major attractions and areas of intetest.The interior is perfectly designed and decorated. Excellent rooms - excellent service, friendly and very helpfull stuff. Those who will visit the place will come back again and again. Thank you for the experience and keep up the good work!!","2066":"Great small hotel in the middle of all the attractions A couple of blocks from te Cathedral and Royal Palace Many restaurants just by, concierge can guide you, all the people at the hotel are great Franchesca has a special mention, she came to help us out with a problem we had with our transfer Breakfast was great !","2071":"A terrific hotel in every way. The location was excellent. Right in the heart of the old town but off the main streets. Quiet and peaceful. Excellent design. The hotel combines a modern aesthetic with some lovely classic elements. Our room was spacious with lots of extra touches that made for a warm and hospitable experience. The staff were all so helpful and gracious. Breakfast was lovely. Spotlessly clean. Yes, a great little hotel.","2074":"A central location but very quiet and rooms immaculate, large, airy and tasteful. The most delicious breakfast & without doubt, the very best coffee anywhere. Every single member of staff was an absolute delight: utterly charming, helpful & humorous. This is probably the best city break stay we've experienced anywhere in Europe!","2076":"The team are what really makes the experience, always pleased to help ...from walking to meet us to guide us in( Thanks Francesca) to recommendation for restaurants   places to visit ( Andrea always had loads of ideas ) Great location , good breakfast and lovely rooms !","2079":"You couldn't find a better location. The hotel is situated just off the pedestrianised main street in the old part of town. The beautiful catherdral is seconds away. All the main sights are close by and the railway station about a ten minute walk. The hotel has only been open about a year. Our room was large, extremely comfortable and spotlessly clean. There were loads of thoughtful extras provided, a nespresso machine, slippers, nice toileteries, room safe and even an adaptor. Wifi was good. All the staff in the hotel were brilliant, nothing was too much trouble. A special thanks to Andrea who was charming, patient, well informed and extra helpful. He suggested very good restaurants and things we mustn't miss in and around Palermo. His advice was spot on. We loved the hotel, loved Palermo and hope to visit again. (Our favourite restaurants were La Galleria which is a couple of minutes from the hotel and Ciccio..in Pentola 15 minutes walk but worth it excellent food)","2085":"Lovely, well-appointed hotel within easy walking distance of all the major sites. Our room was huge, clean and quiet. Staff, to us Andreas especially, were kind and helpful with excellent recommendations of where to walk and where to eat. Good tea & coffee in the room. Charming breakfasts. Will come back!","2089":"Staying here was wonderful. The front desk staff were amazing. Made you feel like you were at home. We were taking our first trip with a child and were very stressed and they went out of their way to make our lives tremendously easier. We loved the superior apartment - which came with a kitchenette. It was stocked with everything you might need. The room was amazing. The bed was softer than I prefer, so I slept on the couch. They had a beautiful crib ready to go and set up in the room when we arrived. The crib was an extra 15E a night and worth it. I loved the linens and wished I could have taken them home. Breakfast was perfect. The location was perfect. We were able to get everywhere easily. However, I would not rent or drive a car here. Parking driving in the area is a nightmare. The cab driver who dropped us off had a great deal of difficulty getting us near there. To emphasize, I would definitely stay here again. We loved it.","2092":"I travelled for 14 days around Europe on this trip and I must honestly say that my stay at Pazazzo Natoli Exclusive Rooms was by far The Best!!! Being that I was celebrating my birthday, I splurged to the Presidential Suite which was very comfortable and furnished with designer soaps and shampoo, well-worth every penny! But, I also heard that the other smaller rooms are also great. The best part was the staff! Extremely professional, kind, and very attentive! At the recepcion, Andrea and Mohammed were Truly Outstanding! Laura, the young lady serving breakfast was genuinely kind and also had a great beautiful and welcoming smile!!! I absolutely recommend this hotel which is Above and Beyond in comfort and customer service. Thanking all the staff at Pazazzo Natoli Exclusive Rooms that made our stay to Palermo a very pleasant and pleasurable visit!!!","2112":"Our reservation was made by our Italian friends that visit Palermo often This is a gem and close to city centre The rooms are great and and spacious The breakfast is good and the staff are competent and friendly The recommendations of restaurants was great I can highly recommend this quaint hotel","2127":"Very clean, beautiful room. Had a better sleep the second night after I worked out how to close the shutters doh!! It's in a good location for restaurants and sightseeing. The staff are so friendly and helpful. Highly recommend If I had to say something, I'd say the breakfast bar is a little too small, you can't see anything when tables are full with people, too many tables in a small area. Other than that perfect!","2146":"I have stayed in this hotel as a couple for 2 nights. We were given a very small room, with high windows that gave me a claustrofobic feeling. I went to the reception and they were prompt to change it. The new room was way better and with a lovely view from the balcony. As this is a palace turned into a hitel, the rooma are quite small and basic, but having everything you need.. such as a safe..a kettle with different types of teabags, a satellite TV and complimentary small sweets..very nice touch. the bathroom is very basic, and we had to put our toiletries in the small bench that was there.. be aware that they don't provide bathroom slippers and the room is with tiles...so bring a pair of slippers if you mind walking around in socks or barefoot :) the breakfast was awsome... basic on the salty stuff but plenty on sweets .. such as pastries, mini cannelloni, croissants in different fillings or plain, vegan or gluten free pastries etc... the juices were orange and pear..they inkluded also coffee (made italian way with espresso) or cappuccino or latte macchiatto etc.. We had a good time there and really enjoyed staying in this lovely hotel.. also, the location is perfect if you want to walk around.. I had several walks even alone in the evening...and no problem at all.. So, overallnI highly reccomend this little gem in Palermo.","2147":"Unfortunately we only were at the Artemisia Palace Hotel for a short while as our flight was late and our luggage stayed in Rome. So by the time we made it there it was 8 pm. We found it to be centrally located with restaurants all around so the location was very convenient. The staff were very friendly and helpful, recommending a restaurant to us for a late dinner so we didn't have to go far. Our room was good sized as was the bathroom. Breakfast was typically Sicilian consisting mainly of baked goods which were tasty.","2167":"The good news about the location of this hotel is that it's an easy walk to many nice streets, piazzas and restaurants. The bad news is that Via Roma is very noisy. Our room was small, but had a little balcony (not for sitting). Although plain, the room had TV, refrigerator, shower (no tub) and an ok bed. There are very few outlets in the room, which was a challenge. The mirror in the bathroom was hung for easy viewing by a ten foot tall person. The breakfast was delicious and there was a charming young waiter, who was very kind. I would probably look for a nicer hotel.","2173":"We stayed at this friendly hotel at the end of our trip to Italy! Hotel was a palace at one time and renovated very elegantly! Our room was very clean with a good sized bathroom, bed and shower. Room was on the quieter side of hotel which was a plus for us.Breakfast is on the main floor with good variety of foods.Reception staff is excellent and showed concern when our luggage did not arrive at airport with us.Airline did find it right away and hotel was very good on informing us on when it arrived! Hotel is close to the port and buses are right outside hotel.It is also on the Main Street leading to all the historic sights. Massimo theatre is about a 15 to 20 min.walk and Ballaro street market is about a 30 min.walk.Palermo cathedral and the Capella Palatina are a distance away by walking but well worth seeing. The mosaics in the Capella are amazing.Palermo has an incredible mix of architecture! We also visited Cefalu a small town 1 hour and 15 mins. away by train. Very pretty with a UNESCO heritage church Cefalu Cathedral built in the 12th century.Sicily and hotel Artemisia was a perfect end to our trip. We hope to return again soon to this beautiful country!","2184":"Only a handful of hotels over the many years and extensive travel that I have done for both business and pleasure have been truly terrible. Unfortunately, this hotel now ranks in my top five hotels to avoid.  The hotel's location is the one positive. In every other aspect, this hotel failed. My room, a single, had some high up windows covered by a curtain, giving it the ambiance and lighting of a basement room where you put guests who you really didn't want to have stay. A single should not mean substandard.  Worse yet, the room smelled horribly, enough that for only the second time ever, I went down to the front desk to ask for a room change. That was a no go; the front desk claimed that they were full up for all three nights that our group was there. Our guide offered to change rooms with me but that would not have been fair to him. They did have an air freshener in the room but the odor emanating from the mattress and some other sources was so intense that it woke me up at night and tainted any clothes that I unsealed from packing cubes. I had to wash all of these clothes at the next hotel. Unless I absolutely needed to be in the room, I stayed primarily in the lobby. This was just not acceptable.  The bathroom was small with only a stool to use for holding toiletries and a make up mirror set at a height only useful if you were perhaps seven feet tall. The provided towels were thin and worn.  Did I mention that loud noises and the sound of rushing water could be heard throughout the night in the room as well? I will not even mention the poor lighting, lack of accessible outlets for charging things or other features that made departing the hotel the best part of the stay. If I was not with a group, I would have explored other nearby options to stay. I understand that the tour operator is now reconsidering the use of this hotel and apologized to our entire group over the experience we had.  The provided breakfast buffet was a sad affair presided over by a staff member who made the soup character from Seinfield seem kind. I don't think he ever smiled and looked put out anytime a question was asked.  The elevator can only have one floor number pushed at any time. So, you had to figure out who went first, then push the next floor number and hope for the best.  Finally, one night as we all arrived back at the hotel between 9 and 10 PM, the front door was locked and no one answered. Finally, a young lady holding some food came out and unlocked the door.  Again, it is rare for me to post a poor review but this hotel unfortunately deserves this rating.","2185":"Great location \u2013 easy to walk or take one of the many Via Roma buses to all the sights. So 5 stars for the location and helpfulness of the front desk staff, but 3 stars for noise between the rooms and from the street, and the size of the rooms; so this averages out to 4 stars. We were in a standard room, a superior room might have been larger. There is a lavanderia right next door down the side street.  Terrific, powerful free Wi-Fi. Helpful staff, made free printouts of maps and things we needed. Bathroom was very small \u2013 shower enclosure was 1 square meter.  Decent but not great buffet breakfast. Hot eggs and sausages (and they sometimes ran out of eggs); the rest was cold meats, cheeses, pastries and cereal. All coffee and tea was dispensed by a barman at the buffet, causing a backlog sometimes when things were busy.","2190":"I stayed here for the three nights in October \u2014 was originally scheduled for 4 nights. For three of the four nights, the rates varied between about 120 and 216 euros. This is appropriate for the very, very basic accommodations offered by the hotel. But one night, smack in the middle of the stay \u2014 and for no apparent reason \u2014 the rate was 1125 euros a night. There is nothing the hotel does to call your attention to that hidden price raise, and neither when you check in or check out do they call your attention to the 10X increase for the very same room you have stayed in for 2 nights already. They did not even give me an invoice when I checked out. It was only when i got to the airport and started thinking about why the total bill seemed so high that I focused on the per night shell game hidden charge in the middle of the stay. The hotel management refused to do anything to change this. By the way, they also charged me for a taxi that they told me I had to pay cash for - which I did. They agreed to refund me if I sent then a bank routing number. NOT A CHANCE. This hotel truly is a rip off. I hope my credit card company will help here. #baitandswitch; #hiddencharges","2192":"Palermo's historic district is super-walkable, but the last place you'd want to stay is right in the middle of it. Aside from the noise, tourists, traffic, vendors and slalom motorbikes, it's also great to be able to get some sanity perspective (and distance) even just once or twice a day. The Artemisia is right on the fringe of where the passagiata (daily sundowner stroll along the via Maqueda) takes place. From there, all of the historic sights and wonders are just a few yards in any direction. I would describe the hotel as solid and entirely satisfactory. The rooms are rather cramped and fairly basic, with nothing in the way of any color or decor. The bathrooms are functional but very dated with hardly any shelf-space to unpack any cosmetics or toiletries. The closet is more adequate for a one-night stand than being able to unpack for several days worth of clothing. The rates vary wildly depending on the day of the week making a mid-week night really affordable, versus a really over-priced weekend night. The breakfast is fair, but t did I mention how perfect the location is???","2195":"I stayed here with a tour group. We liked the room and bath as well as the location. The breakfast room is very small but the staff are very nice, as are the housekeeping staff. Easy to walk to the sites yet enjoy a quiet night back at the hotel.","2206":"My daughter and I spent 4 nights at this wonderful hotel. The staff was friendly and helpful. Our room was spacious and clean. The breakfast buffet had something for everyone. Lots of choices. We thought the location was excellent! We were very pleased!","2208":"Stayed here for 4 nights, our first room had no windows though which wasn\u2019t great start. Spoke to reception who said the hotel was full and we couldn\u2019t move. We planned to check out the next day and find another hotel but when we went down in the morning the staff immediately said they had another room for us and was just waiting on it to be cleaned. We went out and by the time we came back our luggage etc had been moved to the new room with a balcony.  Staff are attentive, hotel is decent basic but ok. Noisy outside but location is great. Near Louis Vuitton, Gucci, an amazing wine bar across the road.  A lot of young woman and men begging with their children, broke my heart to see the kids be sent to tables with little plastic cups. I took one to the ice cream shop and bought him some ice cream and sweets after his dad took the \u20ac5 out of his plastic cup I gave him and he got really upset. I would recommend if you intend to give anything buy the kid a chocolate bar or some food as after I have another girl money two boys met with her and she gave the money to them.","2212":"Loved this hotel. It is clean and spacious. Completely updated with beautiful modern furnishing. Great complimentary breakfast. So much to pick from. Beautiful balcony to walk out on. The staff was so pleasant and helpful. I would have given it five stars except for a noisy party going on down the street. We just put light music on and went to sleep.","2223":"The hotel is small, spotlessly clean and in a good location for the centre of Palermo. Most locations are within a 15 20 minute walk with several good cafes and restaurants close by. On the whole. all the staff were very friendly and for the most part helpful. Our room was on the first floor immediately above the breakfast room which due to marble stone flooring and lack of sound proofing was very noisy in the mornings. Chairs scraping on floors etc. In addition the rooms could benefit from improved double glazing given its location on a main thoroughfare (via Roma) and unfortunately during our stay there were also major roadworks going on starting at 7am (not the hotel's fault). The breakfast room is very small so at peak times, very difficult to move around the buffet area without knocking other guests' tables. More attention could also be paid to keeping the breakfast dishes replenished. Although this wasn't helped by some of the guests taking extra supplies to provide a substantial picnic later in the day. Again not the hotel's fault.","2227":"Stayed here for 5 days recently and overall it was very good. Location is fine, about 15 30 minutes walk away from most of the sites and attractions. Lots of restaurants and bars in the neighbourhood.  Staff were OK. Hotel was exceptionally clean. The room we had was large. Bathroom could do with updating.  Breakfast was good, but they did run out of orange juice on two days we were there. Which seemed poor since they could have just got more oranges to juice!","2234":"We did not have the pleasure of meeting Fabrizio, but if his responses to some of the less flattering reviews are any indication, we would have liked him as much as those colleagues we did meet. All were, without exception, extremely helpful and utterly professional. Sandro and Giuilia who checked us in were very welcoming and have us an excellent introduction to the highlights of their city, including which tourist traps to avoid. Serena, who chimed in and also checked us out, is a true gem and helped us arrange our trip to Cefal\u00f9 when we were in a bit of pickle. The rooms are cosy, the beds comfortable, and the bathrooms perfectly adequate. The tv has a wide variety of channels, including international news and sports, and plenty of kids channels. Breakfast, too, is perfectly fine, and, if one would rather start the day with granita, there are plenty of good options within a couple of minutes walk. While the selection is, as in many places in Sicily, replete with sweet fare, the savoury mini-croissants, typically amazing tomatoes and the fabulous coffee are reason alone to enjoy breakfast at the hotel. It also helps that the kitchen staff are just as charming and helpful as the rest of the staff. The location, contrary to some reviews, is also very good, close to public transport (2 minutes walk to the airport shuttle at Politeama), a bus stop right outside the hotel, and the railway station within walking distance. Given the chance, we would certainly return, and of course recommend the Artemisia Palace Hotel wholeheartedly. The friendliness alone is 6*.","2239":"We very much enjoyed our two nights at this hotel. Rooms are clean and reasonably sized for Europe. Breakfast was great and staff are friendly, accommodating and professional. Ten minute walk to historical center. Highly recommend","2251":"This was the second hotel I used in Palermo, fourth within Sicily - very disappointed given relatively good reviews. Unlike some of the other reviews below, we were given a cold welcome upon check-in. When we got to the room, I was surprised to see mandarin language brochures on the table, but didn\u2019t think too much of it, until I got to the bathroom. There was opened contact lenses, used toiletries on the sink and in the shower - clearly the room wasn\u2019t cleaned properly. When I used the shower, the shower head fell and hit me on the head - the pole holding up the shower head was not secure. Most concernly, the tripadvisor forums and other websites indicate that tourists should avoid the area between Via Roma and the port at night. Given the location of the hotel, it\u2019s easy to park and head a little east of Via Roma towards the port. We went for dinner and asked the front desk if it was a good restaurant area, and they didn\u2019t indicate anything was amiss. When walking 5 minutes east of the hotel, we could hear whistling to indicate our arrival, and the body language of people changed. It was not a safe area for tourists after dark. Yes, west of Via Roma is where all the shops and restaurants are, but so are better hotels, with better value for money and consistently good service.  While the fresh pastries in the morning were fantastic, the unclean room and shady neighbourhood made our stay uncomfortable and unenjoyable.","2256":"The hotel itself was ok, it would be better if they put a bit of money into updating the plumbing and elevator. The room # 404, junior suite was a reasonable size and quiet. The bed was comfortable, The bathroom was tired and the plumbing was horrid and the shower was desperately in need of a redo. The staff was young and with the exception of a few were unprofessional and not very helpful. Breakfast was basic, and again the staff was slow and not very responsive. The location was very good, an easy walk to restaurants and all that you would want to see in Palermo. I would not return to this hotel or recommend to anyone.","2263":"We had a two-bedroom apartment, a living room, and a balcony. The living room furniture was old and mismatched -- it reminded me of a grad student's apartment, but everything was clean and functional. We considered 65 euro a night divided by two persons to be a bargain.","2265":"Great location in Palermo near some nice restaurants and the Main Street. Staff were really nice and the breakfast each morning was simple but really nice. Good was great too. Decor simple and not fussy.  Definitely return if I came back to Palermo.","2267":"This well located hotel was very clean and had excellent customer service. The front desk staff were very helpful with maps, bus locations, etc. The rooms were large and quiet, the beds were comfortable. The breakfast offered a huge variety of food and custom coffees were made as ordered. My only negative comments are that this hotel was overpriced. I stayed at another hotel in this area and it was much nicer overall and reasonably priced.","2270":"First time to Palermo & I\u2019m an American who doesn\u2019t speak Italian; sadly no Italian . However, Artemisia location was so centrally located . We walked to all restaurants and shops & I kept up w  my adult children. No problem. The staff was kind and patient; very helpful w restaurant reservations and directions ( although google was very easy for that ) . The room was nice size especially for European standards . We had full balcony wrapping our corner room . Bed was VERY COMFORTABLE. ( tip:there is a laundry across street that accommodates same Day & very reasonable)","2276":"This hotel's staff are the warmest I've seen in Sicily. Everyone from the desk staff to the maids are welcoming which I sometimes didn't find in other Palermo hotels. The rooms are immaculate and the location is the best. Giovanni the manager was so kind and helpful. He is the best and was patient because I did not speak Italian. They speak English well at this hotel. The breakfast room is charming and more than adequate. I highly recommend this hotel.","2284":"It was booked one day before, so we needed to pay a bit than the others offers I checked, but we decided stay there because of recommendation. It was a good decision. Nice people working there. Good service.","2308":"This hotel was fine except for the street noise. It is situated on via Roma, one of the busiest thoroughfares in Palermo. At all hours of the night, motos were accelerating, buses and   or trucks screeching their brakes, ambulances wailing, etc. Some bar or another dumped its empty glass bottles in a metal receptacle every night. Car alarm every night. Then, at 7 am roadwork would resume, one morning with jackhammers. Although the hotel windows were substantial, they were overwhelmed.  Our room was fine, although the king bed fit poorly, a common problem in retrofitted boutique hotels. The bathroom worked fine too, except the toilet seat was the smallest I have encountered, I am a normal-sized man of 70 kilos and I was too big to fit on it.  The breakfast offered a large selection. They serve no other meals.  Staff was always helpful & friendly.","2316":"what a lovely stay over the saint valentines festivities   we left on the 14th late in the afternoon after having spent two nights in this lovely boutique style hotel right in the centre of Palermo   easily reachable by public transport from outside the airport arrivals area and this takes you to one of the biggest squares in Palermo following a 40 minute ride from the airport to the Politeama and then just a 5 minute walk from the stop to the hotel. The hotel is decorated beautifully, modern barocco, the rooms are spacious and airey, a fridge is provided and the bathroom is well dressed with monogram towels and amenities, wifi is free.  The staff are exceptional and make every effort to accommodate needs and give information, the chamber maid on our floor was called Emanuela and the rooms were cleaned to perfection, she was lovely as were the girls in the breakfast room. The breakfast was huge, hot and cold, savoury and sweet and there were products for vegans an gluten free options, basically from cheese to bacon and eggs, deserts to cereals and yogurt, dried to fresh fruit, basically nothing was missing - coffees made to order and sweets available all day - this place is perfect located for sight seeing and shopping - i just have nothing negative to say - it is a perfect hotel, run by profession staff and they deliver EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE WITH PASSION. Thank you for a wonderful stay, we are looking forward to our next trip to Palermo and lookin forward to seeing you all again soon. Rita and Gennaro, Avellino.","2323":"We had an opportunity to visit Palermo this January for three nights. We enjoyed the location of TheArtemisia Palace Hotel, as well as the great service the front desk provided for us. The breakfasts were done very well, in the Italian way, with great Parma Ham, Salami and fabulous breads and pastries. The Hotel is well established, and has a feel of being so. Room was big and bathroom more than adequate for us. Clean and respectful all the way around.","2336":"I stayed for 3 days & 2 nights, on the 4th to 6th November, at this very nice apartment and would highly recommend it. The balcony and rooftop view of the historic Opera building and the whole city of Palermo during day night is impressive. The place is very clean and Ms Paolo and Mr Federico were helpful in all my needs. Thank you :slightly_smiling_face: Grazie Mille","2342":"We spent two nights as a family there, two fantastic rooms on the third floor,great view on the vibe of the city, just in front the Massimo Teatro. A brand new, very clean, great, yet interior tries to preserve classic Italian with a great touch, and history of the place, nowadays Sephora rents the ground floor, brilliant decor . The accommodation was Super. I definitely recommend it - warm recommendation, efficient, also assisting you with parking very near the hotel in a safe place, helping you with luggage to the hotel - one minute from the parking. - Federico who manages the place is a great guy, helpful and understanding, with a good service attitude . I strongly recommend the location, the surprising beautiful very large rooms, illuminated and fronting the whole hassle and basale of the dynamic city, yet, quite quiet , since inside the room of modern facilities and great glass work. I will come back Federico and Philipo. The Palazzo is cleaned every day in the morning, you have your breakfast at the coffee downstairs where Federico gives you a voucher, allowing you to order all you can desire. Also - Federico was very helpfull with arranging us a private tour. Thank you guys, you got a new customer, surly coming back . You deserve the highest rating - in my opinion, the concept of this luxurious Appartments with a full service is a winner.","2345":"There simply are not enough superlatives to describe the wonderful experience we had staying at this property .The room and everything in the entire building was first class ! Federico is a genuinely nice person and helpful at every step ; from communication via e mail in booking , through our stay and through our departure. He arranged for our transportation in Palermo, including our visit to Montreal, a dinner in Mondella and excursion to Romana del Casale. Our driver, Lorenzo was fantastic and he drove us from Palermo to Siracusa. We were very pleased with his services. Palazzo Sovrana is truly exceptional. We were warmed engaged in many conversations with the owner and his son Philippe and I can tell you they were sincerely concerned about our every need to make our stay wonderful. They know how to define and execute the true meaning of hospitality. Located in a beautiful setting and lovely environment.","2349":"These serviced apartments are well thought out, near brand new and in at really good location. A magic combination for a romantic or practical get away. We only stayed one night in this converted building that was once a shoe shop and enjoyed it immensely. Restaurants abound. Fredrico, the manager told me they have multi-bedroom units too.","2352":"I hesitate to rave about this place for fear that Ill never be able to stay again due to it being overbooked. It\u2019s the gem of Palermo. We\u2019ve stayed in several 5 star hotels in the city, but nothing compares to this. The location, although busy, is in the heart of the city, the accommodations are upscale, contemporary and elegant, plus you can\u2019t beat the views. Federico goes above and beyond, assuring that all our questions, concerns and needs are met. You can tell that he loves what he does. The renovated building is done to perfection. Although it lacks a lobby or restaurant, the breakfast vouchers for the bar next door are perfect. The real beauty is the roof top view. It\u2019s a 360 view of the city. Federico went so far as to place a small table and two chairs on the roof top so that my husband could enjoy a glass of wine upon his late arrival into Palermo. The attention to detail is over the top and so appreciated. We can\u2019t say enough about this beautiful property. I think I\u2019ll book this ASAP for next year.","2359":"There are not enough words to describe my experience with Palazzo Sovrana, but I will try. It started 2 months before my arrival after I had booked my reservation on line. It was my first time to Palermo and i was inquiring about taxi services to and from the airport. In addition, we were taking a cruise out of Palermo so we were coming in one day before the cruise started, and staying one night after we disembarked from our cruise. We would need taxi service at least 4 times just going to and from the airport and the port. Federico responded to my email and asked for my dates, approximate times etc. and informed me he would reach out to me. I expected to hear back in about a week, however Federico responded within 24 hours and provided me with a full itinerary along with cost (which was reasonable). Just like that my transportation dilemma was resolved. This impeccable service did not end there, i sent an email about a week before our departure just to confirm and just as smoothly, Federico responded again with a breakdown of our airport pick up and drop off at the port the following day. When traveling to an unknown place, simple matters as these are what set one hotel apart from others. Our flight landed a whole hour late and i expected that we would be left to our own devices to get to the airport, not so! Our driver was there waiting with a sign and the minute we identified ourselves he whisked us to the waiting car and then confirmed with Federico that we were with him. Our driver told us that Federico had stayed in touch with him to convey our flight information so he knew it was delayed and that had also confirmed with our driver to ensure our pick up. Upon arrival to the airport, Federico was there to not only greet but help us with our bags, and walk us into our room, but also confirm with the driver for our pick up to the port the next day. This was definitely comforting to know that our ride would be there. The hotel: The room was immaculate, and the view was breathtaking. We had a balcony that faced the Theater Massimo (spelling?). The room has a fridge, expresso maker and a kettle for tea. The bathroom is huge and has Ferragamo bath products and includes bathrobes and a hairdryer. The bed was a large king bed with comfortable pillows and luxurious linens. Federico gave us a quick overview of the room, the wifi and the breakfast cafe where we would go for breakfast the next morning (included in the hotel booking). Before he left, we asked for any recommendations for dinner etc. he asked for our preferences and told us he would get back to us. By the time we settled in, we received an envelope with restaurant recommendations and other wine bars etc. We were very specific in our request and Federico delivered with his suggestions. The next morning as we were leaving the room, Felipe who works with Federico was on site to ensure a smooth departure. Upon our return to port, once again our ship was delayed, however our driver was waiting for us to take us to the hotel upon arrival, Felipe was ready to greet us and escorted us to our room. After being at sea for 7 days, it truly felt like coming home. We were lucky to get the same room with the breathtaking view. I had made a comment in passing to Felipe about the nice smell in the hallway and if possible if he could let me know what it was. I did not really expect a response, but later that day we got an email Federico with the name, brand and picture of the product they use. It is small touches like these and the personalized service that one receives that separates one hotel from another. We have just been back a day and we are already looking forward to our next trip to Palermo and there is no question that we will certainly be staying here on our next stay too. Thank you to the staff at Palazzo Sovrana for making our trip effortless, relaxing and above all memorable, you all went above and beyond in service and we can't thank you or praise you enough. Thank you!","2361":"Loved this place! Not one fault. Frederico was so kind and helpful. The location was great, albeit noisy. We loved the cleaning service, views from rooftop. The decor was exquisite.the breakfast voucher was perfect.","2362":"Beautifully and newly renovated with modern facilities, with historical pictures and a letter from the Pope\u2019s assistant (who later became the Pope himself) appreciating the bespoke shoes of the house that used to occupy the building since the early 20th century. Very spacious and well designed, we very much enjoyed our stay. The management is top notch, and very hospitable.","2364":"The apartment is in an awesome location, right off of the beautiful Teatro Massimo plaza. Beautifully renovated, elevator building, surrounded by lovely bars, cafes, and restaurants. Easy walking to all of the attractions...we were at Capo and Ballaro markets within 10 minutes. Ferragamo bath products, comfy beds, gorgeous little balconies that overlook the Opera house...this place was perfecto! Federico was awesome from the start. He was there to greet us at the door, show us to our room with a brief tour, and gave us excellent recs for dinner that evening. He followed up to see if he could make a reservation for us, which we took him up on (AMAZING dinner) He also helped to arrange transportation to the airport and even helped my inlaws do the same although they were staying at a different location, thanks Federico!","2370":"The location is amazing. Across from the theatre and rooms offer great view. The rooms are clean, modern and well appointed with a separate kitchen area. Breakfast is good and easy. The owner is very responsive. I would stay again.","2376":"This charming hotel located right in the heart of Palermo was perfect for our stay! The staff was friendly, helpful and charming. The room was clean and modern with a small kitchen as well. Recently renovated, this hotel had lightning fast internet, cold AC (this is important in June) and updated noise reducing windows. It was the perfect place to come back to after a long day of sight seeing in the busy city. If we come back, we would certainly stay here again!","2384":"Couldn\u2019t have asked for a better stay in beautiful Palermo. Paola and Federico made our visit very special and I can only highly recommend this property. I\u2019m a frequent traveler and I found that the Palazzo Sovrana ticks all the boxes for a city visit. Perfect location; very clean rooms bathrooms; great sized apartments; and the PERFECT hosts. I look forward to going back.","2387":"What a fabulous place!!! This luxury hotel was renovated not long ago and they\u2019ve made each apartment different, all of them so authentic! In the best location and with stunning views. We went there a few weeks ago for a family Birthday and had the best time ever! Staff was lovely and special thanks to Federico (director) for helping us SO MUCH and looking after us so well and giving us a real 5 stars service. Fully recommended and we will definitely go back!!!! Gracias!!!","2407":"This place served it's purpose for one night - to get into Messina and out of it again as quickly as possible! Messina was not a particularly nice town, a bit soul-less, so I wouldn't recommend a stay there unless absolutely necessary. If you do decide to stay, this hotel was ok, but not brilliant. The air conditioning did not work in the room, the lady on reception was not particularly helpful and had zero english (not her fault I know but I would have expected even some basic english), and the bathroom was poky.","2408":"The magic of my staying begun as I entered the door of Palazzo Sovrana. Located in the heart of Palermo city centre, it has been the key to discover one of the most vibrant cities of the world. The kindness if its people is perfectly mirrored in the way you are welcomed to Palazzo Sovrana, spreading all the Sicilian warm but still respecting the level of top international hotels. A very kind concierge drives me to my room, where fresh oranges and wine wait for me alongside with other courtesies of Palazzo Sovrana. The light makes the rest: a breath-taking view of the Teatro Massimo - one of the most stunning European Opera Houses - steals my attention in the frame of my room, a wood-green coloured one with an amazing view on 3 sides, enriched with beautiful photos made by the same owner of the hotel. I found out there was an even better place in the structure as I climbed to the last flor and Scouted THE terrace: a 360 degrees view of Palermo dominating the whole city from Teatro Massimo to the sea and the mountains surrounding, where I had one of the most inspiring yoga session of my life! Comfort-side, I cannot say less: mattress are very cozy, bathroom are spacious - especially the shower! - cleaning is top and many amenities cuddle you during the whole vacation. Thank you Palazzo Sovrana for this beautiful memory!","2410":"I really enjoyed our stay at this hotel; the room was amazing! It was like a small apartment, with a kitchenette, a couple of rooms bathrooms, and balcony with incredible view. We were on the top floor which was quite a trek up the stairs, but they have a neat little elevator. There was wireless internet in the rooms, but I think you need to pay for usage (wasn't clear) - I just used the free internet point they had in the lobby, it was never busy. There were some connectivity problems over weekend, but I think it was just a one-time issue. The breakfast is small but really nice! Cereal, juice, some pastries breads, and a cappuccino machine - plenty to get you going for the day.  One note is that the room slide card is used to enter and exit the hotel itself, and you may have stick it in the circuit breaker box by the door while you're in the room to keep the electricity on (or it'll turn off). I just wanted to mention that because it was the one instruction I had trouble understanding at first with my limited Italian, as I've never been in a hotel that did that before! I think it's just to conserve electricity so you don't leave the lights on when you're out and about.  The hotel is really central, and there is a supermercato just a block north, and lots of fresh fruits veg shops along the street. The Piazza Cairoli is just east about 4 blocks, which is an awesome central location to catch the Messina tram - it will bring you to all the main places you need to go, such as the Messina Centrale train station, duomo, museum, etc (just don't forget to buy tram tickets at the newspaper places before boarding, and validate them in the machine on board).  Overall a really nice experience, and great home base for our travels. Comfortable and clean, and they left chocolates on our pillows which is always nice.","2411":"Modern comfort in a lovely spacious room! I loved the windows view, the high ceilings and all the extra special touches. Clean and relaxing ambience, friendly staff and helpful in making recommendations. And last but not least... best area in town!","2416":"The hotel is a 15 minute walk from The Massimo in a fairly quiet street just off the main boulevard. We liked the location as it was a bit quieter but not out of town. The room was very good. Modern in style with a comfy bed. Shower fine. There was not much storage space and only a few shelves but this was not really a problem. All rooms are on the first floor. Reception staff very good and knowledgeable. Breakfast was good. Lots of choice for continental style but we did not need anything cooked. Overall very good and we would use it again.","2425":"Great location, spacious and comfortable rooms, really friendly, helpful and efficient staff, good quality toiletries and lots of thoughtful extras. The provision of hospitality trays was a bit random and my TV didn't seem to have any English or French channels (not a great loss). Breakfasts are plentiful and good if you're not looking for an English type cooked meal. The Italian coffee is great but the American style stuff in an insulated jug wasn't very good","2445":"The placement of the toilet and bidet made their use problematic.and it would have been virtually impossible for a larger person. The breakfast was below standard for this type of hotel The coffee was not fresh and was often cool and there was A very restricted choice of hot food. Which was not replaced regularly In fact the choice of food altogether was not good at breakfast. All the breakfast food was presented without interest or pride  The staff were friendly and helpful They went out of their way to make our trip pleasant helping with lugage The general environment was good","2451":"We spent two nights here after a long flight. It is on an alley so mornings are a bit noisy but evenings are quiet. Breakfast is enough with your basics like granola, cheese, meats, breads and pastries etc. The shower is small which can be a challenge if you are a big person. The elevator you must hold down the buttons to make it operational FYI. Staff is helpful and only minutes walk to high end shopping. Good restaurants nearby.","2452":"This place only opened recently and is just perfect. It'd centrally located 12 min walk from ferry & close to all historic spits in town. It's very clean, new, modern and hosts are exceptional. Real value for money here & includes nice breakfast.  (Note it's on the second floor & number on outside door hard to find.)","2453":"We went to Palermo for a family wedding . I\u2019am in a wheelchair so needed to find a hotel with accessible facilities the staff at hotel were wonderful and couldn\u2019t do enough for you, for a hotel with a 4* rating you would expect a restaurant ,but only for breakfast no room service. Room was large safety bar I bathroom fell out of wall when I used it and we were moved to another room plenty of restaurants nearby. Would not recommend this city for anyone with a disabilities or in a wheelchair unless staying in the pedestrian area of the city","2455":"Another guest confirmed the best rooms are in the tower. Standard rooms could use an update. Staff is friendly and helpful. Beautiful gardens are extraordinary and make the place worthwhile. Hot tub available.","2456":"This hotel was far from everything, it was a long walk to most places or you had to take a taxi. The room was average, the bathroom extremely small. The shower area was small and I am a tiny woman. The sink area had no place to put your personal items and they gave you no bathroom amenities like other hotels. The walls were thin I could hear the shower in other people's rooms being turned on. My room faced the street and it was noisey. There was never a bartender at the hotel bar you had to ask the reception person to get someone. No spa in the hotel for guest to enjoy. The breakfast was fine with a decent selection of food. The staff and reception person was very friendly and accommodating to calling a taxi, or suggesting some restaurants to eat at. I would not to choose to come back.","2459":"Very comfortable bed in large room with excellent power shower. Breakfast was plentiful. Staff very helpful in guiding us round their city to places of interest. Able to walk to most places, as found the buses were usually crowded","2460":"Hotel is about 20 minutes from the Old City which is a nicer area and much closer to the sites. I would describe this as more of a B&B. The little bar isn\u2019t staffed, there are no real amenities or a restaurant with the food. The morning breakfast buffet is stale and the food is not close to as fresh as the food in Palermo especially in easy areas such as fruit and vegetables. It seems like an easy thing to get right so my guess is that the hotel cuts corners. I wouldn\u2019t recommend this hotel given there are a ton of options in better locations with higher quality offerings for similar pricing.  On a positive note, the front desk does a good job with the little that the hotel provides to them. They are friendly and helpful. Our front desk attendant was very helpful.","2467":"Very good hotel in Palermo. The room we were in had an excelent king size bed. The bathroom very nice. The sink small, the tub very good. Highly recomendable..is not a 5 star hotel, but is a good 4 stars. Located in a very nice and quiet neibourghood.","2470":"A great hotel. Well placed, just a walk away from the old part of the city. Staff were always friendly and helpful. Our rooms were spacious, beds comfortable and the air conditioning was just amazing; a real bonus during very hot weather. We loved the breakfast buffet too, with a good selection of rolls and pastries and wide selection of fresh fruits.","2479":"We booked this hotel for a 3 night break through the BA website and were delighted by its convenient and quiet location. The rooms were very clean and well appointed - love the Ortigya soap and shower wash - and the bed was huge and very comfortable.  Breakfast was lavish, more of a feast, with lots of home made cakes and biscuits as well.  The staff were very polite and helpful, all spoke perfect English and made us feel very welcome.  Great value too.","2481":"We spent 2 nights at this wonderful boutique hotel in Palermo and thoroughly enjoyed it. The wait staff was wonderful, the rooms were spacious and comfortable. The breakfasts were ample. The location was safe and in a nice neighborhood. It was within easy walking distance of restaurants and bars and designer shops.","2482":"We booked a junior suite and it was small, no sofa, no balcony or whatsoever, two chairs, a Kingsize bed and a large bathroom. The other normal rooms are very small. The road is quiet but also a bit to far from the main attractions. Breakfast was good but without any service. The reception was the big plus, very freindly and very helpful.","2484":"American Express chose this hotel for us . Breakfast was included. The staff were genuinely helpful, caring and kind. Bruno and Felicity were especially kind and helpful while one of us was ill. The location was good and our room was quiet. The neighborhood was safe. The price was reasonable . We highly recommend this small hotel.","2488":"Nice clean hotel in close vicinity to city centre. Ideal location for anyone taking a short break and when visiting the area without own transport. Very helpful staff, especially Bruno. Ample restaurants and bars within 5-10 minutes walk. Option of airport transfers by taxi or bus.","2489":"Totally a very good experience in a very good location in Palermo. Very nice rooms and very clean. I would definately recomend this hotel for a short stay in Palermo. Staff is very helpful and friendly","2493":"Elena, the owner, is lovely, works extremely hard and is always accommodating. The room was spotlessly clean, the bed extremely comfortable. With the tram service going by 50 metres away, the city centre can be reached in 15 minutes (far preferable to driving-in and then having to find a parking space). The breakfast table is plentiful and Elena will do her best to meet her guests' requirements.  I would recommend this B&B without hesitation.","2494":"This is a very nice hotel with clean rooms, not too far from the old town, friendly staff and nice breakfast. We especially liked the Aperol spritz from the bar in the lounge. Our room did not have a great view but the rooms were comfortable and great for sleeping with the jet lag. Location would be good for a shopping trip.","2498":"The hotel staff were helpful. We had one of the smaller rooms, but everything worked and was clean and thoughtfully appointed. Comfortable mattress, above-average breakfast. The common area on the ground floor was absolutely beautiful with lots of couches and spots to read. We had a lovely cocktail hour before heading out to dinner. Quiet street in a vibrant neighborhood with lots of shops and restaurants. I appreciated being close to the old city but staying in a more up-to-date building.","2500":"We stumbled across this wonderful B&B after a long tiring day of travelling. And we were rewarded with our friendly English speaking hostess Elena welcoming us into her comfortable, well appointed and clean home with everything we needed! Her breakfast was delicious and she even provided gluten free choices for my wife.","2505":"Our room was light, airy and comfortable, clean and stylish.The hotel itself was not too big and was beautifully decorated. and full of character with individual and original works of art everywhere, including the bedrooms. The staff were very friendly and helpful, giving us tips on places of interest to visit and how to purchase tickets for the bus to the Stazione Centrale. A very good quality breakfast was included in the price. We especially liked the freshly prepared fruit and wished that more hotels would offer this. Some larger hotels tend to use canned and preserved fruits. The hotel is not in the prettiest of locations but, if you don't mind a bit of a walk it is not far to the Old Town with its Cathedral, Teatro Massimo and many other beautiful places to visit., and there is a good bus service around the city. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to stay in Palermo. It is one of the nicest we have stayed in.","2506":"Giuseppe was fantastic! His passion for the local history and area was infectious. Parking is an adventure. The very very close parking cannot be accessed by anything wider than a VW Polo with its mirrors folded in. Hahahaha! As we fit it was ideally convenient. I am not familiar with their other parking area. Breakfast was an excellent assortment of 0 km offerings.","2507":"I stayed for 2 nights and Elena is amazing with her care of her guests and the B&B. I was very early and Elena was kind to meet me, store my bags, and let me know when my very clean room was ready. The breakfast is extensive and delicious. Elena was so helpful through my stay in suggesting places to go, where to eat, and how to get around. I can recommend visiting the Regional Museum and seeing the Caravaggio\u2019s there. It\u2019s a very short walk from the B&B.","2510":"What a charming place to stay. Each room has its own design and aesthetic with careful attention to detail. Breakfast was generous, homemade and full of local produce. Our hosts were very kind and made us feel welcome. Parking is tricky but not impossible.","2515":"Our visit here was fantastic, from start to finish. We booked in very late, as we were exploring the whole island, and they could not be more warm and welcoming to us, including secure parking, drinks, snacks and recommendations for the town. The room was stunning, with fabulous artistic detail, and comfortable too. Breakfast was wonderful, and I particularly liked the organic donkey milk additions for the bathroom. I would stay here again in a hearbeat, and recommend everyone else to do the same.","2523":"I gave this hotel a 2 star because the hotel is in a good location and the staff was friendly. The hotel is extremely understaffed. The bar was empty, in order to get a drink we had to ask and then the maintenance man waited on us. It desperately needs a makeover. The rooms are cheaply decorated. The carpets are stained and threadbare. My impression is that the hotel is doing anything to save money. The breakfast was underwhelming. The hotel is depressing. The front desk said we couldn't have a late check out because they were booked but I only saw 2 guests the whole time I was here. Guests slept here but went other places as soon as they got up. I would not stay here again.","2524":"A visual delight at every turn. What a delicious breakfast selection curated with pride by the caring owners and staff. We felt welcomed and invited. The room was (as is the whole place) well designed and appointed. Excellent bed and bedding.  They provided outstanding recommendations for restaurants and sites to visit on day trips. (We went to Agrigento on one day and the Villa Romano on another). We ate at Tommy's (a must), The Trattoria Grotta Azzurra, and also Le Tre Rose.  The secure car park is a short walk away. The secure lot was full on the first night of our stay but they had a place to park in the back. Good thing we had a small car! (See photo).  Be sure to call and let them know when you plan on arriving so someone will meet you in the square as you will need to know where to leave your car. As we were leaving, they were installing a new sign on the street to the property - but it is still best to have someone meet you.  Everyone spoke perfect English and they genuinely want you to love staying with them - and we did! HIGHLY recommended.","2525":"I really loved the place. Outside the neighborhood is very shabby and then you enter this door and you feel like home: silent, clean, well furnished. I only met Larissa, who is very sweet, careful and organized. I did not like the city itself, but thanks to this B&B, I will still have a good memory of this journey.","2526":"We were on private luxury tour supposedly. Last two nights were here. Room was small and dark, toilet stained and would not flush properly. Curtain in bedroom was hanging off rail and would not pull. Internet was hopeless. For breakfast four people could not sit together, could not even get waitress to bring us a cup so we could have coffee. Carpets in corridors were stained and threadbare. On return we spoke to travel agent who had booked trip and hotel\u2019s response was totally unsatisfactory","2533":"We had the Cielo Room which was smallish but clean, the bathroom the same, smallish but clean. Breakfast was very nice with lots of local cheeses and other specialities from the region. Mrs. Cettina was very helpful and offered some nice choices for dinner and things to see in Enna. I would stay again and would recommend","2535":"One look at the threadbare carpet on the stairs and stains on the furniture tells all. Tiny rooms with extremely small bathroom and not very clean. Breakfast very limited and not replenished. Travelling with a group and didn\u2019t select this hotel.","2542":"We stayed one night in Enna as part of our trip around Sicily. Staying at P&G Design was truly a delightful experience. We stayed in the Vasca (Bath) room which is on the ground floor and absolutely huge. It has a wonderful spa-like bathroom also. I hadn't picked the Nuvola (Cloud) room because I wasn't sure about the round bed, but we were shown it the next morning and it would have been wonderful also because of the great views. In any case, we were delighted with the Vasca room. The included breakfast was wonderful. The night before we had a delicious dinner at Tommy's which is a short walk from P&G.  But the most special part of the B&B is the owners, Pamela and Giuseppe. They are warm and enthusiastic people who just want you to have a great experience in Enna, and will go out of their way to be sure that is the case. We had great conversations with them.  I must also say that our nav system gave us poor directions in downtown Enna and their assistant Cettina had to wait for us because we were later than expected. She also had to meet us at a place not very close to the B&B and guide us there since the nav system was not helpful. But she did this with good humor and patience. Just another warm and helpful person as part of our stay.","2544":"Hotel approx 20 minute walk to more interesting sites in Palermo so not best placed for sightseeing. On arrival - No explanation of hotel facilities. Our room was more like a box - perfunctory with minimal natural light. Noise from the corridor felt like other guests in the room with you! Recommendation from concierge for a good typically Sicilian restaurant was awful! Worst pasta & service ever! Breakfast at the hotel was dire - hot food cold, not a lot left after around 8.30am. All in all, a bad introduction to Palermo & not a 4star hotel - you have been warned...","2545":"Pamela and Giuseppe were wonderful hosts-nothing was too much trouble and Pamela\u2019s breakfasts were fabulous. The room we stayed in had once had a historical well that you could view through glass-amazing. Enna is a lovely small town within easy reach of the wonderful Villa Romana del Casale and the outlet village. We ate with friends at Tommy\u2019s Wine restaurant which served classical Sicilian food and great wines. All in all would highly recommend.","2547":"This hotel was selected by our travel company as we had no experience travelling in Sicily. The hotel was adequate, clean, with a friendly staff. Room and the bed were comfortable and had adequate storage space. We were walking distance from good restaurants and attractions. in the evening they opened the bar for us even though it had closed.","2555":"We were there as a couple and really enjoyed our stay at Hotel Principe di Villafranca. Although the trip there dates a year back, me and my wife still have very good memories of our stay in Palermo, because the hotel staff was very helpful and provided us with a lot of useful information how to make most of our stay. Furthermore they put a lot of effort in serving a nice breakfast. Rooms very very clean and comfortable and the other hotel facilities were very well designed. Indeed the design of this hotel is very well thought, minimalistic but stylish but still keeping the overall ambient very cosy and relaxing.","2561":"The hotel is located in a quiet residential area within walking distance of tourist attractions. The rooms are simply appointed, large and comfortable. The bathroom was basic and spacious. The property is well staffed (lots of people working) and everyone was helpful and attentive. The breakfast was basic and included in the room rate. This is not a fancy property but it is clean and well kept.","2567":"We stayed for one stormy night in October in the room with the circular bed and enjoyed our stay very much. The property is on a quiet side street with outdoor parking nearby (either in a courtyard through a very narrow passage or in a small garage). The room was spotless and detailed with interesting objects d'art throughout. The hosts booked our dinner reservation at Tommy's (see review) and put together a really nice breakfast featuring many home-baked goodies. A well-designed and run B&B.","2569":"We, a young couple, stayed here for (unfortunately) one night only. We wish we could have stayed longer!! The rooms are beautiful, the owners have a strong vision and idea behind every room. They have great taste. Our room was kind of a very luxurious \u201ccave\u201d, with a spa-like bathroom. It was very clean and comfortable. Breakfast was breathtaking: a great variety of (local) fresh products. Here, again, the owners had thought the concept trough. Last but not least the owners: they are very kind, patient and speak Engels very well. They gave us great advise on what to visit and where to eat in Enna. Tip: eat at Tommy\u2019s Winebar, very romantic and delicious! @the owners; Thank you so much for the lovely experience!","2570":"Newly remodeled B&B with great service. The breakfast was nice, the service so warm and friendly. Two sisters manage this B&B. It is right near the tram station. We got scammed by a taxi who charged us from the ferry to get here. Take the tram as the stop is right across from the B&B. So convenient! The fridge had free water and fruit. Such a nice welcome and all B&Bs should do that. Everything was nice and the bathroom was brand new!","2573":"The rooms were great, the staff were incredibly helpful and the buffet breakfast was excellent. Our only negative was that we would have like to be closer to the old city (not the hotel's fault!). There are some lovely restaurants nearby (e.g. Trattoria Biondo) which made for lovely evenings.","2575":"Firstly, the neighborhood is fine. Its away from the bustle of Palermo, which is not a huge town anyway, and the surrounding streets have plenty of reasonable and varied restaurants and coffee shops. This hotel occupies the 1st level of an apartment block, although it has its own entrance. I found it hard to call the hotel refurbished. Whilst certainly not as dated as other traditional Italian hotels, I found the place poorly thought out whenever it last underwent it's refurbishment. Everything echoes. The walls are paper thin. The floorboards create sound, ie other peoples. The doors on thin wall frames and floorboards make it sound like a bomb going off each time someone lets their door slam. You hear people in the corridor as though they were in your room. The internet connection is dire. Virtually unusable and unreliable. Housekeeping did not replace our toiletries daily., we had to make them last 3 nights. So we felt we paid too much for a quality that was not evident. No coffee machines as was advertised on one of the websites. Just did not feel this place. Breakfast was sufficient with all the basics except hot food.","2576":"We stayed for two nights in the Cloud Room with the round bed. The view from there is fabulous - with Mt. Etna in the distance. The room lives up to the design name with lots of fine details. But best of all, the people were great. Very friendly and helpful - you feel like part of the family. Oh, the breakfast with all the local dishes was extremely good too. We can only warmly recommend the place!","2584":"Spare, colorful interior - we had a round bed; a view over the valley. Up to date bathroom (a good size too). Felt as if I were walking into a shelter magazine interior. Guiseppe and Pamela go to great lengths to make you feel welcome. But - hard to find! Down a narrow street - be sure you get instructions on where to put your car before you arrive, if you're driving. We gave up trying to find the B&B, stood on the side of Via Roma, called for help. Guiseppe came by in his car, we followed him to the B&B's parking. Quiet; our room had an individually controlled heating system, TV, good wi-fi. But - little storage space for your clothes. You are in the center of town, an easy walk to the panoramic road, Duomo and Castle. Good restaurants near by.","2589":"We booked this 3 night trip to Palermo through British Airways and and chose the the Hotel Principe Di Villafranca for our stay. The location of the hotel was just right, a 10-15 minute walk to the center of Palermo. Sadly we were not to impressed with the Hotel.  The rooms were to small as was the ensuite We only had half a wardrobe not long enough for dresses Our room, although a superior didn't have bath robes The TV in our room had no international channels The advertised Gym didn't exist The advertised Bar was in fact a table with some drinks on it in a lounge room, which was only available if the handy man was around. Breakfast we missed on the last day, pointless  I find it hard to believe that this hotel is rated 4 star, I have queried this with BA. The staff were very friendly and helpful with directions, we would look at other hotels when we return to Palermo.","2592":"Good centre for restaurants and walking around the city. Reception desk manned at all times and all very pleasant. Breakfast good but waitresses a little slow to clear tables . Taxi service easy to book.","2596":"We spent a wonderful 2 night stay in Enna at L&G Design by Lago. Cettina met us in the square and guided us through the narrow access to the private car park - we had a Fiat Panda and got through without a problem. The room (circular bed) was wonderful - everything you would want. We spent the days wandering around Enna, which is a delightful town. Breakfast was very, very good and Cettina recommended 2 excellent restaurants for our evening meals (Tommy's and Tres Roses). What more could you want?","2600":"This was a really nice experience. Great location, great room, great house and hosts! The rooms (I saw all three) are so special. Each piece of the furniture is unique. We moved every night when on Sicily, but I missed the good night sleep from Enna (P&G).","2601":"This place doesn\u2019t look like much from outside, but inside it is lovely and you will likely be surprised. Nice living room, sitting room. Big comfortable rooms with giant bathrooms and comfy beds. Very well appointed, but with one exception. Place needs more outlets and outlets in more convenient places. Breakfast simple but very nice. All of the staff were attentive and pleasant,","2602":"Myself and my husband stayed at this stunning property on our way back to Catania on the last night of our holiday in beautiful Sicily. Each room is a work of art and the breakfast and the hostess were wondefful. A huge ghdnk you yo Giuseppe and his wife and their wonderful staff for their hospitality.This is an amazing b& b that will fulfill your every wish. Thank you all and we will be back for sure.","2618":"A superb location in Palermo. Very kind staff. Breakfast is great. Room and beds are comfortable. Bathroom could be renewed renovated. A little oldish style of late 90\u2019s. No foreign tv channels. And small screen size.","2627":"Booked a room at P&G on very short notice and were immediately taken with gracious and welcoming staff. Giuseppe and Cettina guided us through our whole stay beautifully. Hospitality here is truly on another level. We stayed in the very centrally located loft apartment and loved it. The decor is fabulous, the bed is extremely comfortable and the whole place is filled with the kind of lovely thoughtful touches that make you feel as though you are in a (very posh) home away from home. Only the highest praise for P&G! Grazie Mille!","2632":"We selected this place based on the excellent reviews and price, and yet our expectations were exceeded.  The neighborhood is just full of life with lots of cafes and bars. The B&B was artfully decorated and the room was spotlessly clean. Carmelo, you've created a fantastic B&B. Congratulations and best of luck to you.","2637":"This is one of the best (if not the best) places we have ever stayed in. The location is very central and the rooms are luxe. The decor is 5 star and the price you pay for a night is ridiculous. Each room is decorated differently. While there we were with friends and booked all the rooms. The owner greeted us when we arrived gave us loads of information where to eat and where to visit. We really enjoyed our stay here.","2641":"This place has a fantastic design and highly finished. The owners are very nice and helpfull, plus the location is excellent, a few metres from the city center. Was a pleasure to stay there, and would love to go back.","2660":"The B&B is close to the terrace offering panoramic views of the surrounding area. We booked the large room on the Ground floor. We loved the decor of the room; it was very tastefully renovated and we loved the sink and bed by the Lago company. The room was very large such that if we had our mats, we could practice our yoga there.  The staff Cettina was such a nice lady. She was so helpful with explaining the things to see in Enna and outside and also recommended nice restaurants. She also explained about the design elements of the rooms and was very helpful at breakfast. Her home grown figs are so sweet, amazing.  If you drove a big car, you could not get through the street leading to the B&B and the carpark at the end of the Street. You would have to park in a Private carpark about 5-10 min walk away (but Cettina will lead you there and walk you back). On day of checkout, the gate to the carpark (unkempt and lots of wall graffitti outside) couldn't open. fortunately there were a few other locals waiting to get their cars too and eventually managed to get out.","2668":"Great location, went to watch the football and was within walking distance of the stadium. Easy to walk to most attractions but the hotel probably requires an update. It\u2019s fit for purpose for a short break and breakfast was good, particularly the cannoli :smiley:","2669":"This B&B has been very tastefully decorated and provided excellent accommodation. The hosts were very attentive to our needs and provided a delightful breakfast including many specialties of the region. A modern oasis in the middle of a very historic town.","2681":"The hotel is situated well. The area is relatively quiet and you are also a 5 minute walk from many spots like the opera house and Via Maqueda. I'm guessing most Palermo visitors hit Maqueda at night for the passeggiata. Breakfast was substantial (free in lobby) with a very good coffee machine. The only drawback was the air conditioning. For three nights it never seemed to work well. We couldn't find an English TV channel, but that didn't bother me. Very friendly staff.","2705":"While still amazed at the beauty of the Nebrodi's park with its variety of rocks, plants and animals, finding a place like Agriturismo Pardo was really the cherry on the cake. Welcomed by extremely kind staff, spoiled by the abundance and quality of food, and pampered by a beautiful environment, I highly recommend the place for your staying in Sicily. Rooms are clean and comfortable, and the place is centrally located to access the most beautiful locations in Parco dei Nebrodi. We will certainly come back!","2708":"We stayed for 2 nights on our Scilly tour a great position. The rooms are large and clean.the staff are efficient and friendly. We didn\u2019t have the evening meal only breakfast which was very good. It\u2019s very good value the garage is two streets away and extra cost but safe.","2710":"We love Ibis hotels- in terms of value for money they\u2019re great! Stayed in many all over Europe and never had any issues with them- this one is just as good! For a place to stay for a city break it\u2019s great! Good location, friendly staff, clean room with everything you need, our room was really spacious too. Ok it\u2019s not luxurious and the view from the room wasn\u2019t great but if you want a place to stay where you\u2019re out most of the day exploring your surroundings then it\u2019s brilliant. Breakfast was excellent- lots of choice, the croissants were delicious! The hotel has a bar and restaurant- there\u2019s also a nice shaded place to sit outside too. There\u2019s a supermarket about 5 minutes away.","2715":"My room was not clean. I could write my name in the dust in certain places. The bathroom however was clean. I complained and afterwards it was cleaned very well for the rest of my 8 night stay.  The aircon emitted a funny smell the first couple of days and the same goes for when I was taking a shower. Both disappeared. I suspect for the shower it had something to do with the pipes. For the aircon I have no idea! Shower pressure was good.  Furniture very outdated and really not acceptable. This is also the first hotel ever that didn't put a mattress protector on the bed! Highly unusual and not very hygienic either!  I never got noise from my neighbours but the entrance doors to the rooms are very thin and you can hear everything from the corridor. The hotel is located on Via Roma which is a busy road and hence very noisy. But it does get more peaceful after 11pm.  The bathroom door had a terribly loud squeak. (The hinges needed some oil) I never reported it because I wanted to see if the cleaner would report it to maintenance. It was still squeaking when I checked out.  Breakfast was well attended by quests and there was plenty on offer. Bread rolls were soft and I didn't feel fresh. It would have been very easy to makes them crispy again. But there was plenty of choice. Staff were friendly and attentive!  Location is very good and what made this hotel was the lovely ladies at reception! All praise to them. They were kind, helpful and caring! One even warned me one evening when I went out (I travel alone) to stay among the people! (I did!) They all spoke excellent English and nothing was to much trouble!  In closing I would like to state that the Cristal Palace presents it self as an 4 star Ibis Style hotel but in my opinion it is a 3 star. The decor is also not very Ibis style like, which from my experience is far more contemporary.  The Cristal Palace tries but fails on some basics such as hygiene and maintenance! But the reception staff, location are great!","2744":"This is a good 3 star hotel with very helpful front desk staff . Our room was good with comfortable bed and good shower . The aircon was just functioning well enough . The location is ideal for seeing the city and transport access.  Footnote about speeding motor bikes who have no common sense or regrds for the law or others . They need to be challenged by police who seem allow them to be a danger . . .","2750":"Situated in the centre, it is very easy to take the bus from airport PMO or Trapani and walk to the hotel. Its worth to save the money as airport taxis are totally overpriced. Just around the corner you will find the hop on hop off bus at the Politeama Theatre. Very convenient location.  This holiday hotel has an outside sitting area for coffees and meals, which is lovely. I chose not to have my dinner there, since you constantly beeing bothered by beggars. Nice lobby area.  From pics I can see that rooms varies a bit. I had a doubleroom on the 8th floor of quite good size, however walls needs some fresh paint and furniture dark brown boring decor. Very good aircon, good wifi, safe, minifridge (2 bottles of water upon arrival) kettle and tea-( Im a coffeedrinker so did not use it), tv had 100+ channels in Italian language, I was not able to locate any news in other languages which in 2019 is not really good. Walls paperthin and you will hear doors banging and follow conversations in the floors.  Bathroom of good size, mine was with shower, good waterpressure and plenty of hot water. Soap shampoo in containers. Fresh towels everyday and cleaning was efficient . Big plus about room was that you are able to open windows.  Breakfast served from 7am, plenty to choose from, hot and cold items, good coffee, and fresh bread. I did not find morningstaff particularly friendly.  Premises kept clean, frontdesk staff friendly and helpful and a perfect location. This Ibis Styles is a 3star hotel, and recommended for a holiday stay in Palermo.","2757":"We have visited in June. The hotel is beautiful. The rooms are large and clean. The area is great .The staff at reception need a crash course in hospitality as they have no idea how to give a service. Food is ok nothing extraordinary. Waiting and bar staff are very nice. I would go back again.","2758":"This hotel is strategically located near the centre, the port and piazza politeama; as well as salinas' museum and teatro massimo. Rooms are wide, people very kind and available. Air conditioning is very effective. It is close to airport connections and trapani's port connections. Several restaurants at walking distance.","2764":"We stayed only one night and it was one too many. The location of the hotel is convenient but they have no garage and if you have a car you need to unload your luggage in the street, in the middle of the maddest traffic and then go around and around and find parking opposite another hotel ... and the same again when you leave! They gave us the Presidential Suite so we should not complain about the room, but the hotel is really second class, the service is really poor and the breakfast ridiculous!","2794":"Good things: Room spectacular, shower great and clean, nice view Breakfast good  Bad things: We asked to use the indoor pool, which we found out at the hotel (not before) that there was an extra charge involved. The extra charge increases by adding things that you want to use in the spa i.e. for pool one price, to add sauna price increases.  When we went to pay just for the use of the pool they informed us that we need a kit e.g. head cap etc, which was also with a charge. For me this was not clear and we were disappointed with this, as we chose this hotel because of the spa which at the end we did not even use!  Quite a disappointing experience after the hotel was recommended to us.","2795":"This is not a 4 star hotel. The room that we had (302) had three lamps in it, each of which had water stains on them. The bed was hard with thin sheets and a thin blanket. It did not look like the images on the website. Admittedly, we did see into some of the other rooms as we went down to breakfast and they seemed more modern. Our room has drab furnishings from the 1980's. We were going to leave without breakfast but decided to try it and were pleasantly surprised. There was a wide range of food and pastries on offer. The staff were also courteous and polite. Nice staff let down by drab furnishings. Time to modernise. I have stayed in other 4 star hotels in Palermo and this is definitely not a 4 star, though the range of food for breakfast was better than the others. A 3 star hotel with 4 star staff.","2810":"It was my first trip to Palermo and my first stop at the Ibis Cristal hotel. It was very good because the room was warm, not common in hotels in Italy in the spring. I was a little worried that the hotel is far from the historic center and Palermo Centrale, but no problem, you can buy a daily ticket and drive 101 or 102 buses. The hotel room is clean, cleaned daily, fresh towels. Nice and responsive staff. Good breakfast with warm food.","2818":"Stayed here for two nights with group tour of 40+ Canadians visiting the battlefields of Sicily in the Second World War. First time at this hotel as usually a place in the old Alta Enna is used. This large resort hotel in Enna Bassa (Lower Enna) is very good for groups on a busy schedule. The check in was smooth and the rooms large and well appointed. The hotel restaurant is very good and has a great selection of local Sicilian wines. We arranged for bagged lunches for our group and these were generous and fresh. The lobby bar was busy and the wait staff attentive. The access for a large tour bus is interesting but our expert driver had no difficulty. If you wish to visit Enna itself, you would need to drive up to the Upper city, about 20 minutes away, but for a busy tour group that arrived for dinner and left at breakfast this place was ideal.","2820":"Yes mate very nice - clean rooms, really friendly and informative staff, great decor, loved the fact there were instruments everywhere you could play and even purchase. Heaps of activities offered by the hostel, paid breakfast varieties that were banging, kitchen where we could cook, balcony area where we could hang out, bar serving wine by the litre. Good location - everything you need nearby and lots of lovely short walks to attractions and markets or down by the sea. Sweet as mate, I feel bad for not getting any of the staffs name, they were all excellent.  One thing - dont like that the double bed is actually two singles. Comes apart as ya sleep, or move or breathe. It was Valentines, man.","2827":"It's clean and has a decent common area. I also like the staff, they are cheerful and I felt like they actually wanted to get to know me. What really sets it apart is their huge collection of instruments. I can imagine that epic jams are happening on a regular basis, unfortunately I was only there for one night in the low season so I didn't get to be part of that.","2839":"Everything is clear and fresh The breakfast is big and Healthy! And the atmosphere... Oh just wow, the location is not far from city center and its close to bus station It was easy to communicate with stuff and they were really kind and put attention a lot on details :) But the only thing I didnt enjoy that much is shower. It is connected to toilet and it was not divided, so people coming and peeing and you talking shower in the same time right there :sweat_smile::see_no_evil: But its just my opinion Exapt that I would hiiiiiighly recommend it!","2851":"This is the best hostel I ever visited because of people who manage hosting. Great experience in their caffe, playing drums for the first time, singing... There is always party on balcony so it doesn`t disturb other guests. I come just for one night and extended my stay. Hostel is safe and clean. I will come back.","2852":"We stayed at the Casa di Amici with a group of 25 persons for a week and really liked about everything... The rooms are spacious and nice, the terrace is a perfect place for hanging out in the evenings and the common room is great for meeting people and we were even allowed to use it for meetings during the day. The staff was super helpful throughout and there was even a kitchen where you can prepare your own food. So in sum: highly recommended if you look for a laid-back hostel in the middle of the city!","2859":"The hostess is a lovely, charming woman. She runs her hostel like a friendly little bed-and-breakfast, so you always feel welcome. Guests are a colourful mix of young people - playwrights and barmen, globetrotters and newcomers to overseas travel. Surprisingly, Palermo offers much, and you will find everything you want both for sunny days - like delicious ice cream on the beach - as for the rare rainy day - paintings in ancient houses. Will visit again.","2861":"Nice hostel with great outdoor terrace for chilling and meeting people in the cooler evenings, as well as large cool common areas good for relaxing during the hot days. Only frustration was the lights in the bathroom don't stay on long enough, as they are actived by sensors, which can become rather annoying at night","2866":"We stayed here for two nights at the end of our trip to Sicily. It is the sister hotel to our favourite hotel in San Vito lo Capo and is almost as good. The interior is beautiful, the rooms are great and the staff is very friendly. The breakfast is of high quality and everything works out as expected. A clear bonus is that the hotel is very modern and just in the centre of the city so you really are close to everything!","2872":"Felt like an international home :house_with_garden: We'll revisit u for sure! Comfortable beds, clean rooms and bathrooms, nice atmosphere, kind, friendly, warm people. Breakfast included. Close to the city center. Everything we needed.","2873":"I went on a solo trip to Palermo and I've never felt so welcomed in a hostel before. The staff is excellent, friendly, and truly cared about giving their guests the best experience possible. I met many new friends during my stay here. If you want to meet people and socialize, this is the perfect place to go. If you want to hangout alone, this is also the perfect place to go. Do it.","2880":"I've been staying at the hostel at the beginning of April, the position is really great and it feels like you're at home. Moreover it is very clean and well organized. People working there are very kind and helpful. I hope to be back again soon!","2889":"Nice place to stay, relatively close to city centre, safe neighbourhood, quiet (at least my dormitory facing towards a side street was), good is that it has a self-catering kitchen. Breakfast was good. What I do not like is that it has mixed sex dormitories. Staff are friendly.","2898":"Very welcoming, clean, and comfortable (though the rooms didn't feel as secure as they could be, e.g. shared bathroom couldn't be locked from the inside). I got some great recommendations from the reception staff, especially Alessandra, of things to do and where to eat. Would definitely stay here again if I was visiting Palermo.","2907":"Very polite and helpful receptionist. You have good bar and nice terrace to enjoy cigarette or toscanello. You are located few minutes walk from Teatro Massimo and Teatro Garibaldi. Just across the Teatro Garibaldi beside Prada shop is a bus stop to the airport. A lot of things to do in Palermo and a lot of help from the staff you can expect.","2912":"The staff was friendly and helpful. Ready for conversation or a laugh or just directions. Plenty of travelers to speak to and the basic food was good and fresh. I recommend it to anyone. Plenty of music instruments to play also.","2924":"We were glad we chose this place, mainly as the view is fantastic, (and you can enjoy it from a private balcony), but also because for the price it offers a lot - generous breakfast, high-quality accommodation (if a bit on the small side) and warm and friendly service.","2925":"I really appreciated the welcome of this hostel. There was a kitchen where we were prepare our breakfast. Many explanations have been to me provided so that my stay in Palermo goes well.I'd like to come back for another vacation with friends.I was so happy to go there.","2930":"Great little B & B. The lady on reception was so welcoming and helpful with her recommendations of where to eat and what to see. Situated close to the train station and ferry port and tram stop, this B&B is ideal for exploring Messina. The room was large, very clean with a quaint little balcony, and sea view. Continental breakfast was good and could be ordered, to be delivered to your room.","2939":"Great decor and fabulous bathroom with shower, very comfortable and spacious with lovely authentic French shutters opening to a little balcony. No lift but can be expected as located in lovely old appartment block. Wonderfully private with your own codes for entrance so you can come and go as you please. Close to railway station and port as well as promenade and old city - very convenient indeed. Breakfast fine, just the usual. Excellent value for money. Definitely recommended.","2940":"Situated just a 5 minute walk from the center it's small but charming. The rooms are modern, romantic and light, The staff is very helpful and friendly. Everything is very clean and bright. Fresh water coolers and a coffee machine at reception where you can brew your coffee at any time with your own pads. Breakfast can be brought to your room without extra charge but the breakfast room is lovely and always attended by someone to make you a great coffee of choice from the professional Espresso machine. No eggs and warm English breakfast but fruit juices and handfruit, cereal, bread, fresh baked croissants and pastry and a small selection of condiments cheese salami etc. Dot us more then plenty even for a longer stay. We were here for work at day time and holiday at night time and we loved it. Silent rooms, double shutters.","2942":"We stayed in this hotel for 7 days and were absolutely delighted. Despite the additional bed for our son and loads of luggage in our room it was still spacious and let us feel comfortable. Those big rooms are hardly a standard in Italy, so this is really an asset. I also have to mention that the hotel is very clean overall, even in the breakfast room. Parking is also relatively easy, as you almost guaranteed find a space in front of the hotel, at least overnight. Tickets you can buy in the hotel. But our heartfelt thanks goes to the very nice lady at the reception, who enthusiastic, warm and friendly was there for us throughout our stay. Her commitment to let us feel comfortable in the hotel was higher than we had experienced in some five star resorts. Staff at breakfast and for cleaning was also very friendly and helpful. So we can highly recommend this small hotel and will stay there again.","2943":"The common area: kitchen, living room, terrace all close at night until around 8am. That\u2019s the worst part of this hostel, it limits socialization and free time. Also, they have a bar that they overcharge common cheap beers at and do not allow you to bring your own alcohol in. Your only options at night are to either stay out or be silent in your room. If you book it for a cheap rate it\u2019s worth it but I heard the lady in reception quoting someone $49 euro for a night! Anything over 20 and this place isn\u2019t worth it.","2944":"A Casa di Amici is excellent value for money. I was only in town for one night but I could see this is a very well run hostel. Friendly people. Very close to the Airport bus. I had a room to myself and it was as good as many hotel rooms, and it had a nice ambience missing in many expensive hotels. The shared bathrooms were very clean. Breakfast was good. It is a bit noisy on the front street. Highly recommended","2948":"We are a couple in our 60s and only ended up here for 2 nights thanks to the super helpful Tourist Office who found a room here when out our booking elsewhere fell through. Room was huge and clean and comfortable. Help yourself breakfast was fine and sociable. Some couples  singles like us and lots of younger ones. Not our usual type of place but thankful we found it and would go back.","2954":"An amazing cooking class with chef santo !! He really enjoys making food that tastes great, he's very creative and his food makes people happy.  The class included a tour of the al capo market allowing us to practice italian phrases to buy our local ingredients for the dishes on the menu.  Santo was very attentive showing us in detail and allowing us all to participate in making each dish. Our class included making fresh pasta, prepping and cleaning seafood and various other elements like peeling artichokes and prep work for the parmigiana. We made some delicious typical Sicilian dishes and got to know the market.  There were 5 people in the class and We all had a fun time learning from a friendly and great chef like santo. I would highly recommend his cooking class and the whole experience.  I will definitely be back for another class.","2957":"I stayed in a female dorm, Palermo is a big city, and there was some traffic noise, but during sleeping hours the horns were always at a minimum. I took some classes at a nearby school, and had no trouble finding other travelers to go explore Palermo with when I wasn't studying. The staff was friendly, the owners are fantastic, if you're a fan of music and or food they occasionally offer family style dinners for a small additional charge, and there is a plethora of musical instruments to jam out on in the common area. Overall this was one of my favorite stays, and I definitely recommend it. It is walking distance to Centro Storico, and the convenience is fantastic!","2960":"Stayed in a double room facing the main street Via Dante.  The hostel is well managed, the staff quite helpful and everything is clean. All in all.  There is just no insulation to speak of so you get all the noise from the street. And that can be quite a lot. It might be a completely different story when you are in another room...","2967":"This is an excellent, original, hostel. In a convenient location close to a main bus stop, the hostel is clean and the staff great: friendly, knowledgeable and genuinely sociable . The facilities are very good and the atmosphere is fun - for example the hostel has numerous musical instruments anyone can play. Highly recommend staying.","2976":"After 3 weeks of touring the scenic isola di Sicilia, we arrived at the eastern port of Messina by train from Catania. Rosi is a wonderful person to meet as you check in to this strategically situated B & B. The accommodations are spacious & clean & the staff is friendly & professional ( special thanks to hardworking cleaning crew, Aurora attending the ample breakfast offerings, & Chiara). From the B & B you are a few minutes from the train & marina station. If you're opposed to the clamor of traffic noise book an inner room. We preferred the seaside view & fresh sea breeze & made full use of the balcony. Loved our stay & highly recommend to fellow travelers.","2993":"Entrance disappointing, scruffy and dirty but once inside modern and thoughtfully done & comfortable.  BUT toilets have macerator system, meaning no loo paper in loos, meaning loo paper in bin in bathroom. Can be very smelly and nasty. To be avoided.","3047":"Clean and stylish. Friendly hosts. Excellent breakfast. In a central location with access to free parking. Enna itself has plenty to recommend it with wonderful panoramic views. In addition to the Castle and Torre, a visit to the Duomo is a must.","3063":"Thank you Sabrina and Danilo for taking care of us. We felt like home. The hostel is wonderful and the breakfast was a blast! We are so greatful for your warm welcome. One night only in Palermo it's not enough. We will come back soon i hope...after the coronavirus apocalypse. I hope you are healty and safe! We think about you and your beautiful city and island of Sicily. Forza Italia! with love from Polonia","3066":"We stayed there only for one night but it was really, really good! Nice rooms and you can ask the hosts for everything and they will try their best to help you. Breakfast is good as well! For foreigners too!","3069":"The bedrooms are big, the bathroom is very clean and the breakfast is great: we had difficulty to find continental breakfast on Italy!! I would return again. The only thing is that you need to confirm your reservation. There are a lot of places near this B&B to eat and drink.","3089":"A great find... very close to sites, a few eateries nearby and parking after circling the piazza a few times! Had 2 rooms one had a lift ...the other a spiral staircase so be prepared! The breakfast was in a very cute underground area with the basic sweets bread and salami. The family were all delightful friendly and helpful. The rooms were nicely decorated but couldn\u2019t turn the aircon on... other than fabulous!","3090":"This is a great place to stay in Palermo.It is near the port and you can walk to the historic centre.We booked directly with the very helpful owners. Afea B&B is spotlessly clean and comfortable with wonderful art decorating the walls. We had delicious Sicilian treats for breakfast and will definitely book this B&B for our next stay in Palermo.","3092":"Spent the Night here after visiting the Villa Casale. Right in the centre and beautifully done out. Staff are super helpful and breakfast was good. One of the best B&Bs we have stayed in. Parking can be a problem but you can park and bag drop in a little square 25 m away, then buy some parking cards and put it in the main square.","3097":"this place is basically a flat divided in rooms with 70's furniture and walls painted and graffitied to make it look cool, lift to first floor is tiny and old (2people+2 big suitcases won't fit at the same time) poor wifi, (when we asked the male manager to fix it, he responded that people shouldn't be on their phones all the time...poor air-con and poor service (male manager very rude demanding passports first thing in the morning and payment of city tax and forgetting to say please at every sentence) breakfast is not good, splattering sugar everywhere (including on melon slices) and the male manager said it is like that because it is typical from Palermo. The only good thing in this place is sweet cook Glory in the kitchen and her micro scrambled eggs. Avoid","3098":"Arrived late and exhausted to very busy grid locked traffic. Then discovered that there was a grape festival on which explains the traffic. Helpful traffic police let us through the barriers when we explained that the bandb was just past it. Very helpful staff helped with the bags and found a parking spot in adjacent square. Room was quirky up a small spiral star but was lovely inside. Yes all a bit small and tight fit but right in the centre. Great fun at the festival. Fantastic breakfast in really interesting conversion. Our room was only 50euros. Nice staff and nice place. Other rooms in nearby building.","3101":"What a super building and a lovely room. Warm and friendly reception from all the staff. Parking is on the road out front or down numerous side streets nearby. Breakfast is real treat too, some lovely local breads. Highly recommend this place. Thank you.","3102":"Wonderful place to stop. Lovely clean rooms, Danilo wonderful host. Staff were so friendly. Perfect place to stop very highly recommended xxxxx great history in Palermo and great food. Danilo was brilliant in showing us where to go and what to see. Could not do enough for us. We thank him greatlyxxxxx","3103":"It is my second time in Sicily at B&B Antonello Da Messina. It was as good as it was the first time. Each morning we had a Sicilian breast-fast on the house. It was delicious!!! Adriana, the receptionist offered us all the directions how to get to Domo, from where to rent a car, where to eat and what. And her advises were priceless. We met also the owner who was kind enough to pick us from the bus stop and brought us to the B&B. The location is ideal even if you do not want to rent a car, as the tram stop is close and you can get wherever you want.","3113":"We\u2019ve stayed there for 2 nights and the staff is lovely ! Very very helpful and kind. The negative points are that in the room the AC was on top of the bed and therefore, we had to be careful not to get sick from the direct air coming! In addition the universal controller stopped working and we couldn\u2019t even switch it off or change the temperature! Also the wifi has never worked in the room and anywhere else. We had the minibar in the room which was making a loud noise and had to unplug it at night. That said it was cheap and the staff is really amazing so not too bad but there is room for improvement!!","3119":"We good an Upgrade just for free to a new bigger apartment, everythink was perfect clean and new, short time booking was no Problem and the breakfast was very Personell and special, all people werd very Friendly and helpfull","3125":"Great Stay, Very Friendly Hospitable hosts, Air con was great in the searing Palermo heat, Room cleaned every day, Aurelia and Danilo where both very friendly and helpful, Great Location for visiting all sights in Palermo, local restaurants only a few minutes walk away with local supermarket. Would stay again when in Palermo.","3139":"This is the second time I visit Ele House.I just couldn't pass by and not return here.The reasons are obvious:cosy and welcoming rooms,very good price,nice staff and great position.Everyone is friendly and willing to help.They have high quality services.If you ever go to Messina and want to feel the italian hospitality do not miss Bed and Breakfast ELE HOUSE!","3141":"We very much enjoyed our stay. Interesting art work, comfortable room, excellent breakfast with personal touch. Warm, knowledgeable and extremely helpful team. Our very special thanks to Danilo for his advice regarding Palermo and all Sicily and to charming Aurelia who was always ready to help and steer us.","3151":"well, it seems that all my previous pictures were not uploaded for some or other strange reason. this place is a total dump and you would get better service at a super max prison facility. a filthy bughole with DANGER DANGER DANGER everywhere - see the photos","3152":"Where does one start to describe this place? do see the pictures...  DANGER ZONE - AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE  no parking  no one speaks english, no one cares, tacky, unfriendly, way past the sell-by date, bedrooms FULL of dust, 1.5 hours to find a parking space, wi-fi that does not work, run down bedrooms and overpriced.  dangerous electric wires exposed, bathroom FILTHY, years of dust floating around the bedrooms bringing on asthma attack, overused mattress Etc Etc - do see the pictures...  located at a noisy and very busy intersection - no parking  SO, for any tourist who only speaks english - AVOID and if you have a car you need to park AVOID  rooms are dark, uninspiring and chilly, do see the pictures... Oh, and check out time is 10am  PS. I am not a cheap person and have no issue paying up to euros 250 a night - but there has to be value for money. PS. Breakfast was the only slightly acceptable part of the stay - all self service with no idea where to find what (and no help offered).","3191":"We stayed 5 nights in this hotel on an extended holiday in Sicily. This hotel was located close to the centre of the city close to cruise terminal close to train station and close to all amenities. The staff were very friendly and offered great assistance for any information that we required. The room was very spacious and clean. The breakfast was more than adequate and a good variety. Overall this hotel was very good value for money and I would recommended it to anybody visiting Messina","3225":"Nice hotel and nice staff. Close to the hotel, and close to the city centre. They served gluten free bread for breakfast one day, but for the remaining 3 days there were only rice cakes. Ok for the price. Great view from the balcony.","3236":"the location is perfect. the decoration is tacky. the breakfast is good but they serve in plastic plates and glasses... tacky and non sustainable. the workers are nice the owner was not so nice on the phone. I think you can do better with another bb","3261":"We can\u2019t say enough about the customer service of this hotel. We have had to change our plans due to the virus. This hotel has been the most flexible with us in changing our dates and helping us make sure or Sicily vacation can still happen. Our thoughts are with the Italians during this time and we can\u2019t wait to be there in January!","3264":"The staff at the reception were very uncooperative and antipathetic. They gave us rooms at the second floor that were dirty and very badly maintained. A bed was broken. The shower was broken in another room. The glass was broken in two rooms. some of the rooms were stinking and not clean, When we asked to change they lied and said the hotel was full and than we found out that all the sicth floor was empty. when we asked for more pillows they said they don't have more pillows and later we found out they have a lot, and so forth.","3275":"We chose this place because of its proximity to the ferry and train station, but found it to be very nice. The staff was attentive and courteous. The room was spacious and clean. The breakfast was quite good. The price was a value, and we were pleased with the stay.","3279":"Located directly across the street from the lovely opera house, this hotel could not be better situated to see the sights of Palermo on foot. Christian could not have been more helpful at check-in, providing excellent advice on nearby restaurants and also general advice on sights in Palermo as well as other locations in Sicily. I would not hesitate to stay here again.","3281":"Great location!!! Stayed only one night. At first I was going to give this hotel 5 stars ( which I don\u2019t hand out often) but I decided on 4 . The location for the price point can not be beat!! The room was very clean! The balcony was awesome. The Ac worked well as I still did need to turn it on for a bit. It was super clean too!! Some of the staff seemed pretentious but most were great. It is too bad I could not check in early when I arrived as I had informed them of my arrival. Some stairs to bring luggage up at entrance but they offered help which was great. The only reason I took a star off is the bed was very hard with that one sheet. Unfortunately, this is like most properties in Italy but sometimes I get lucky and fine a good bed:grinning: The noise on a Saturday night is very loud ( bands play on square till midnight) but no fault of the hotel. That is what u get when u choose such a great location. They arrange a taxi to airport for 40 euro ( 30 min ride) which was great. And also a wake up call I I had to put ear plugs in with the noise. I actually would of loved sitting on my balcony enjoying the music but I had early flight. It is a very nice hotel for solo travellers with a safe feeling.","3285":"Such a lovely welcoming hotel, one floor up from the Main Street so if you have mobility issues this is not for you. Opposite the Teatro Massimo. Great location, and very friendly helpful staff. We all had breakfast in our rooms, you told the receptionist the night before what time you wanted breakfast and what you would like. Coffee was very good, great choice of ham, cheese, fruit and yoghurt. The rooms were lovely comfortable and clean. No bath but good shower. I would highly recommend this hotel and will certainly use again.","3287":"Older and smaller well located hotel near Massimo theatre. Saw a brilliant opera called \u201cthe Winter\u201d on the refugee crisi. Terrific breakfasts and very helpful staff. Well located in easy walking distance of many attractions. We had a quieter back room","3289":"This hotel is in a perfect location, clean and comfortable, and service is excellent. I was very happy with our choice to stay here in Palermo. The hotel is one floor up from street level, accessed by stairs, so not suitable if you have mobility issues, but when we arrived, they came down to greet us and carried our suitcases up for us. The staff is very welcoming, made us feel at home and taken care of throughout our stay. We had a room with a balcony overlooking the pedestrian street out front, with a glimpse of Teatro Massimo through the trees. It was very pleasant. We were directly above a caf\u00e9, and we did hear some noise in the mornings when they first opened up and played music, but street noise was not generally a problem. The room was spacious and clean, though not luxurious. The bathroom had a typically small shower, and I appreciated the makeup mirror. Be cautious of the room safe \u2013 it is an older style and jammed one night, which apparently is not uncommon as they have a code to use to unlock it. Unfortunately that did not work in our case, so we had to wait until a locksmith could be summoned in the morning (though another staff member ended up getting it open for us before the locksmith arrived.) Don\u2019t wait til the last moment to retrieve your valuables prior to checkout. The first night, they took our breakfast order and delivered it to our room promptly at the requested time. We were given a choice of sweet or savory, took one of each \u2013 bread, sliced meats & cheese, croissant, and a slice of fruit tart, plus juice and coffee tea. It was good, and just enough to start the day without overeating. But the table in the room was very small, so we chose to eat in the living room the next day. There are only a few tables, so you need to schedule your breakfast time the night before. We also found that we could get a dish of fresh fruit or yogurt as well. The hotel can arrange an airport transfer for you, which is nicer and cheaper than a taxi \u2013 it was 43 euro coming from the airport, and 40 euro for our return.","3296":"Great location, modern and clean room. Wonderful staff. A 12 pm check out was great. Great value, highly recommend staying here. Breakfast was served in our room and was adequate to get our day started.","3298":"I'm in Sicily for a long job trip and one day when I got back to the hotel room, all of my and my room mates money was gone! (Around 1000 Euro) When I told the staff at the hotel, I did get a very bad response from them, saying that it will only cause more problems to me if I do a big deal of it. However, I did report it to the police!","3300":"Great hotel in downtown Palermo. Everything you need (shopping, restaurants, taxis) is right outside the door. The room and hotel was clean and cozy, with breakfast delivered to your room every morning. The most pleasant part of this hotel was the service. Specifically, the front desk associates, Christian and Francesca, were so friendly, kind and helpful. They went out of their way to ensure we enjoyed our stay and help us plan and reserve excursions. Our luggage was lost at the airport, and they were extremely helpful with that as well--calling on our behalf to locate it and translating messages that we did not understand. I would def stay here again.","3302":"After the hectic, cacophonous and exhilaration of touring the city, soundproofed rooms was the ticket that steered us here. Its in a fab position opposite the Teatro Massimo, sitting demurely resplendent in Art Deco . Its spacious, restrained and artfully decorated. The bed was heavenly as was the bathroom, especially the shower. Service is excellent.","3305":"It excelled in every expectation- - attentive and helpful staff. - perfect location in the pedestrian area. - looking out on the theatre and pedestrian area but silent thanks to the windows. - awesome AC and better bed. - (light) breakfast in room. - reasonably priced.","3307":"We had a spacious bedroom with all the amenities located next to the reception desk and across the hall from the ornate living room that doubled as the breakfast area. The breakfast had a good selection of fresh fruits and good pasteries. The service was excellent, especially the receptionists who very helpful, always with a smile. The hotel is very well located, right across the street from the lovely, big Teatro Massimo. Only one block away is a stop for the Hop-On, Hop Off tourist bus which takes one around the city to visit the important sites.","3311":"Lovely staff .Very helpful .Always smiling . Great location and parking available around the corner . Breakfast served in room . An easy walk to the main sights in Palermo . We would recommend it to family","3314":"We loved this little hotel. It has only 11 rooms and the staff are so friendly and look after you so well - from reception to those who are serving you breakfast. The breakfast selection is excellent. A special shout out goes to Francesca who is on the late shift who was super helpful and gave us great tips of restaurants and places to visit (go to Cefalu for a day away by train if you have the time). We stayed in Room 109 with a view of the Piazza and the side of the Teatro Massimo - so lovely to wake up to in the morning and sit t the balcony in the afternoon to watch the world go by. The street outside (Via Maqueda) is pedestrianised so there is no traffic noise. The windows work to shut out any noise from the pedestrians on the street. The hotel is perfectly located - you can't get better than this - easy access to tourist sights and restaurants. If you get the shuttle bus in from the airport it is a short and easy walk from the Politeama stop (less than 10 mins), literally straight down the street. I would definitely come back to stay.","3320":"My wife and I stayed here for two nights while in Palermo. The location is the best part of this hotel. The room was very clean and staff was excellent. Just keep in mind that it is a small property with not many rooms.","3323":"We chose the hotel because of the perfect location, very central and with a parking spot nearby. What we got was much more than just the location! Walking into our room we were blown away by the vibe and the stunning view! It's just as good as the pictures make it out to be! The next morning you are given an option to have breakfast in the room and what a romantic way to start the day it is! We also got a free apperetivo on arrival and the staff were extremely friendly and polite. Paid parking nearby in a secure facility, right around the corner. We would definitely stay here again! Well done to the entire team.","3331":"A tired charm to this place that nearly achieves retro nostagia status for the old rundown hotels of Sicily a decade or more ago, but the Junior Suite was in fact a great corner room, light and spacious, double-door entry ensuring quiet, and bargain-priced. The breakfast was surprisingly good - the open bottle of champagne at breakfast also recalled Sicily quite a while ago. Excellent location, a few minutes walk from the train station with a tram stop directly in front, good internet, courteous staff. We were very pleasantly suprised and satisfied, though the atmosphere may not be to everyone's taste.","3334":"The location of this hotel was perfect for exploring the historical center of this beautiful city. Every night we were privileged to listen to live street music from our balcony which faced the Massimo Teatro. The service was excellent and the accommodations were comfortable, particularly after long days of touring. Great local cuisine is always right around the corner or down the street. We would definitely stay at this hotel again.","3338":"Two minute walk to station. Ten minute walk to ferry. Reception staff were very helpful. Close to fentre if town Breakfast was good. Room was ok. We only stayed only one night as we were leaving on the ferry for lipari the next morning.","3343":"This is a gem of a hotel, located within easy walking distance of many of Palermo's most popular tourist attractions. Our superior room was spacious and beautifully decorated with quality materials. The balcony faced the huge Massimo Square with its imposingtheater. The room was spotless and very comfortable. The staff could not have been more friendly and helpful. The hotel is also located just a few blocks from the airport shuttle bus stop. The reception desk and rooms are one floor above street level. Whilethere's no elevator, there is a porter who can carry your bags upstairs. If we return to Palermo, we would stay at this hotel again.","3346":"Nice city hotel well situated directly in front of massimo teatro. Service is friendly. If you have a car you can park in public parking near the hotel - but suggest you prebook with the hotel : parking is nightmare in Palermo. Breakfast is average, breakfast room is small, so not all rooms can go to breakfast at the same time. Area is nice, very pleasant and animated. Good choice if you want to visit center of Palermo just walking","3350":"Located in a quiet area... A tram (43) pass directly in front of the hotel. There is a supermarket in 6 min walk from it. You need 15 min walk to the platea of the astrological clock. Safe area. Siesta time between 1&4 pm. There are a few things that you can do neae this hotel. The internet is so slow... The room are a bit small but clean. The bathroom clean as well. The breakfast same every day but actually tasty with a variety for different tastes.","3352":"This is a hotel we highly recommend. Fortunately, we found this little gem of a hotel via Trip Advisor. Not only is the location absolutely perfect but everyone at the hotel was over the top with hospitality. Our room had a lovely balcony with a great view of the Teatro Massimo. As other guest pointed out, the street is closed to traffic from 10:00 AM to midnight, which works out great. Since you are right in the midst of all the action there is street noise, however, when the balcony doors are closed, it is completely sound proof. The staff provides breakfast in your room and offers a nice variety. If you want to experience true Palermo, this is the place to stay. We look forward to visiting again in the future. A huge THANK YOU to the wonderful staff!!","3353":"I's a tired old place - old-fashioned furniture, holes in the carpet - and needs proper money spending on it. The air-conditioning unit in our room didn't work while, ironically, the air-conditioning unit just outside our 'no-view' window did work - very noisily. They didn't have an iron to borrow and, despite having a restaurant, they didn't have any ice-cream on the premises for one of our younger friends.  It also claims to have private parking but our small medium sized hire car was apparently 'too big' so it had to go on the street.  That said, the staff were genuinely friendly & helpful and, because we didn't spend much time there, it just about served its purpose.","3357":"We looked around a lot, and found Massimo to have newer construction (meaning nice new bathrooms in the rooms), best located, and not too expensive. We spent most days exploring Palermo by walking around and getting lost, but the time we did spend in the hotel was very agreeable. The staff were nice, the room service we ordered came very quickly, was warm, and the order was correct. Its a small hotel, there is not lift, but for us it was not an issue, it added to its old world glamour and appeal. Perfect hotel for first timers in Palermo.","3365":"Decent small hotel just opposite Massimo Theatre. The street is closed to traffic from 10am to midnight, which is great for when you walk straight out the door around central Palermo. They parked our car for us in secure garage nearby (15 euro day). Rooms at front are light with view of the theatre, bit noisy. Back rooms are quieter but no view and quite dark. Breakfast was fine, served in room rather than as an eat as much as you like buffet, but they customised ours on request. If you can't manage a staircase, this place isn't for you. Otherwise, highly recommended.","3369":"Manuela is a marvelous and helpful owner of this great B&B located in a convenient section of Enna. The room was clean, quiet, and came with one of the most stunning views of the countryside. In addition, Manuela's rooftop terrace has an even more breathtaking view and is a perfect place to drink a glass of wine and watch the colors of sunset dance on the hills. Just a terrific place run by a very capable and professional owner.","3370":"This hotel was a gem. Location - in Palermo's main street smack bang between the old town and the new town and across the road from Teatro Massimo. Many attraction are within 10 minutes walk of the hotel. The railway station is an easy 15 minute walk. When the locals come out on the weekend - this is where they congregate in a festival atmosphere - right outside your balcony!! That said the windows are double glazed and it is very quiet if that's what you want.  Lots of restaurants and street eateries are close by as is the main shopping streets and Malls of Palermo. The room was spacious and well appointed - TV, quality wifi, small dining table, chairs, coffee maker, refrigerator, safe, big cupboards, complimentary water and a mini bar (at cost). Bed side lighting controls are great.  The views from the balcony are just great.  Breakfast is provided to the room daily although there is a lounge area where you could also have breakfast. You have a choice of breakfasts.  The bathroom is a reasonable size with large shower. Usual shampoos etc provided.  The staff are very helpful providing advice on the city and umbrellas when raining. Nothing was too much for them to do for you. Thank you","3380":"The hotel was perfectly located in Palermo - very close to all of the sites and for walking the town. Unfortunately the rooms and facilities are somewhat dated and need fo be refurbished. There is no elevator and a steep set of stairs to climb to reach the lobby so I wouldn\u2019t recommend to anyone with walking limitations. Also - finding it and finding a parking place is a little overwhelming at first.","3382":"We stayed at the Massimo Palace for 4 nights in the first week in October. It was a lovely experience and one we can thoroughly recommend. We are not ones for 5 star hotels but we like comfort, cleanliness, friendly staff and a great location. This hotel has the lot It is excellently located on Via Maqueda (the main street into the heart of the city) which is pedestrianised except for service vehicles and right opposite the magnificent Opera House. The hotel reception is on the first floor where you are greeted by lovely smiling and fluent English speaking staff. There are only about 11 rooms, some with balconies and views to the street but all the rooms are very nice.The piazza surrounding the Opera House hosted a Tribute to Ferrari the second day we were there and we had 150 Ferrari's and other classic cars on our doorstep. Fabulous! Turn left or right out of the hotel and within paces you are in the old cobbled streets that are packed with restaurants offering a plethora of dishes to suit most tastes. Early October in Sicily is about the same temperature as Florence or Venice in early September around 25 to 30+ degrees which suited us just fine. Being based at the Massimo was ideal for walking the narrow street markets or visiting the fine shops or just viewing the historic mix of architecture left by Sicily's many conquerors. Palermo as with most other Italian city's is not for night owls and so the restaurants get busy about 7 to 9 pm and most are closing up after 10.30. Not a bad thing as you won't be disturbed by late night revellers outside the hotel keeping you awake.","3383":"This is a very popular hotel in Messina; it's 1 block from train station. I do not believe there any 4 or 5 star hotels in this area. Hotel is very old but they have made some good updates. Our room was large, high ceilings, new hardwood floors and a large brand new bathroom. The breakfast room and lobby are also new but the hallways need lots of help. They are very dark, dismal and smell musty from the old carpets. The air conditioning was not cold enough for me but my big issue was breakfast. Menu is fine for 1 to 2 days but we stayed a week and not one thing changed for breakfast the entire time. I love eggs but 7 days of scrambled eggs did not do it for me . I actually considered going else where for breakfast even though breakfast was free. The staff was very friendly and helpful.","3384":"The Massimo Plaza hotel is on a piazza facing the opera house. It is centrally located in Palermo and you can easily walk to many of the main sights. The neighbourhood has many bars and restaurants within a few minutes walk. Our room had a view of the piazza, and although Via Maqueda is quite busy, the room has excellent soundproofing and noise was not a problem.The staff was very helpful. Through the hotel we arranged transfer to and from Falcone-Borsellino airport and all went well. Good breakfasts as well. if we return to Palermo we will definitely stay here again","3408":"On a recent visit to Palermo, my wife and I stayed at massimo plaza. The hotel staff is lovely and they organized a wonderful walking and food tour of the city for us. The accommodation however was not great. The room was ordinary and the bathroom was tiny. We were however lucky enough to get moved to their new hotel which was close by. It was unfinished except for a few rooms and may I say when this hotel opens it will be beautiful and luxurious. Thank you to the staff for organizing the move and understanding our needs We will definitely contact them again when we return to Palermo","3413":"The Staff at Massimo was fantastic, they assisted in our daily journeys and restaurant selections. Breakfast was served in room each day. Room was clean and comfortable with a view of the street below. The lobby was one floor above street level and they do not have an elevator which was overshadowed by the great staff.","3415":"My wife and I stayed here for two days. The hotel is in the best location with use of a secure car park around the corner. I was a little reluctant to give my car keys to the attendants but it was fine. They were very helpful and charge E15 per day. All of the hotel staff are very helpful and friendly. We had a problem with our shower and the manageress, Francessca, arranged another room straight away, both rooms had a view over the Massimo Theatre Square. Francessca is very good at her job. If we ever return to Palermo we would consider staying here again.","3425":"This small hotel is friendly, quiet and very clean and comfortable. The staff are extremely helpful and friendly. Breakfast was served by a very friendly, efficient and hard working member of staff who made sure I had everything I wanted. I chose to stay there for a second time and both stays were to the same high standard. Thank you.","3426":"This hotel is in the old city section of Palermo. It is well situated if you are looking for the cultural section of town but you need to walk quite a few blocks to get to the more upscale shopping district. I was surprised by the number of homeless people (and stray dogs & cats) on the streets in the pedestrian area and especially found the people using puppies and dogs to panhandle disturbing. That aside, the rooms and staff of the hotel itself was welcoming and comfortable. The staff was patient and helpful with any questions we had. Breakfast served in the room was delightful. One word to the wise\u2026 driving in Palermo is very stressful and treacherous.We had requested a manual rental car but were given an automatic and advised that we would be happier with the car if we were traveling to Palermo. Wow - were we glad once we got there! There is a lot of traffic with tiny and narrow side streets almost impossible to navigate. We ended up parking a few blocks away and walking wherever we wanted to go because you don\u2019t want to drive if it is avoidable. I would recommend this hotel. They made excellent recommendations for dining and sightseeing. The staff is very attentive and eager to make your stay in Palermo pleasant.","3434":"We stayed here one night after taking a nine hour ferry from the Amalfi coast. We weren't sure what to expect because it had only 3 stars but we were pleasantly surprised. Our group had 3 rooms - all were very large and comfortable. Online, some people had complained that the rooms were old-looking, but we thought they were a welcome change from the tiny rooms we'd had in other parts of Europe. The staff were friendly and helped us find parking for our van - note that vans are too tall to fit in their parking garage. The breakfast was good. All in all, I recommend this hotel and would stay again.","3435":"Definitely recommend the hotel! Incredibly helpful staff, location in city centre, delicious breakfast in bed, very clean rooms with all needed amenities. Would return to the hotel if we visit Palermo again.","3451":"The hotel like many in Italy\u2019s cities starts on the first floor so there is a long flight of steps. It is easy to find and close to car parking with excellent information sent in advance.  The room was fine with a lovely view of the street and the Theatre. But the bathroom was tired and that is the overall story of the hotel.  Breakfast is served in your room.  The staff are great and extremely helpful.","3454":"First, the location and staff were absolutely great. The room we got was terrible. The main problem is that the room 103 is located in immediate proximity of the reception and breakfast room, so we got a lot of noise, especially in the morning. In addition the room had a bad smell and was very dark. I re-checked the reviews on TripAdvisor and it looks like the other rooms don't have this problem.","3458":"We stayed at this hotel over the Easter period 2018 for two weeks. The Hotel staff were very kind, helpful and professional. They were particularly good with our 6-year-old daughter. Situated in the Piazza Verdi opposite the Teatro Massimo, the hotel has brilliant vicinity. The Piazza is so well used, from our balcony we viewed it all - live music, comedy theatre performances, local boys playing football, the daily 'Passeggiata' and even a demonstration on equal pay for female scientists! There is a certain faded glory about the hotel building, but this all adds to the charm. We really enjoyed our stay here. Grazie mille a tutti!","3460":"We loved staying here at the start of our holiday - the hotel is right in the heart of the action. This does mean - to be fair - that it can be a little noisy at times, but the double glazing was pretty good, and I would recommend earplugs. The plus point is that you can turn straight out of the hotel into the evening passeggiata. Service was exceptionally friendly and efficient, and we loved the breakfast in the bedroom: lots of nice ingredients delivered to your door at the time of your choosing.","3463":"First the plus points: location, excellent (an easy walk from airport bus stop number eight); staff helpful and friendly; cleanliness very good. A decent sized room and a large bed. For us the breakfast was a big negative -- you are encouraged to take it in your room as their breakfast room is so small. So, beyond ordering a 'sweet or savoury' breakfast there is no choice and what was delivered was distinctly average. Also, the shower head in our room couldn't be directed properly as it flopped down. The hotel was decent value for money and we'd recommend it for a one or two night stay but no more.","3469":"Our 4 day stay at this hotel was great! What made our stay so comfortable was the wonderful staff! They went out of their way to make sure we were comfortable and taken care of! The location of this hotel is perfect! Would stay here again! Thank you Francesca for all your help during or stay!","3481":"What to expect at the Massimo Plaza Hotel. Expect a positive experience. The location is perfect to explore downtown Palermo. Directly opposite the Teatro Massimo. In the heart of the pedestrian walking district. 15-30 minute walk to just about everything. Perfect. Expect warm and welcoming service. The hotel is small so not much for staff. Everyone at the front desk was helpful. Plenty of local suggestions. Order a cab no problem. All speak perfect English. Breakfast ordered night before and delivered to room exactly when requested. The rooms are good. Average size by European standards. Clean. We had an issue with our bathroom and were promptly relocated to another nice room. I\u2019d recommend the Massimo Plaza to absolutely anyone visiting Palermo.","3492":"This small hotel is ideally located to explore Palermo. The best part about the hotel (by far) is the staff. Each and every time we came in or left, they greeted us with a warm hello or goodbye. We chose to have breakfast in the small common area, but you can opt for an in-room breakfast free of charge. The breakfast was simple, but very good. The room was an adequate size, and clean. The one down side was the bathroom. The shower flow was very low. However, if you want a good hotel close to all of the sights and value great customer service, then you can overlook the less than perfect bathroom. We certainly did. To us, having a welcoming and helpful hotel staff is much more important.","3494":"I want to start with the good. The location is excellent, couldn\u2019t be better, from the balcony you can see Teatro Massimo (although the trees are in the way, some of the pictures on the website are fake). The room is spacious, the bed is comfortable, the sheets are good quality and the staff are lovely. The hotel were also able to offer a gluten free option. Unfortunately the hotel is like going back in time from the modern reception through to an 80s bedroom and a 70s bathroom. I was told the the bathroom is to have some work done to replace the silicone but I think it needs more than that. I struggled to make myself use the shower and if we had been staying for longer I would not have stayed. It\u2019s the worst I\u2019ve seen and it cost over \u00a3200 a night. I\u2019ve tried to add photos but I can\u2019t make it work but inside the door of the shower it was black and the grouting was yellow.","3504":"Excellent location very friendly and helpful staff. Rooms were clean and comfortable, we had breakfast in lounge, rather than the bedroom which worked well, lovely fresh bread and pastries. Plenty of restaurants in the area from budget to more expensive.","3585":"Very charming and friendly family run B & B. Clean tastefully decorated rooms, quirky cellar breakfast area. Staff can't do enough to help you park, find restaurants and see the sights. Enna too is beautiful, and not ruined by tourism.","3709":"I'm not one to write reviews and to be fair the hotel rooms, and bathrooms were quite large and clean by Italian standards. The food was quite good as well. There were some significant problems. We were there in middle June of 2013 and Sicily is quite warm with few trade winds to cool the place. So after a long day of sightseeing and hiking around we returned in the late afternoon to find the air conditioning was not working. They informed us that they would not turn it on until 7 pm. The room was an oven until that time. Our stay lasted 3 days and we avoided any attempts to relax in the room while there. This appears to be a family owned establishment and the apparent padrone is an elderly man with a rather unpleasant presentation, at least toward me when I asked for A C.  Additionally the place appears to rely on a business in catering large parties as most rooms appeared empty during this busy season and the dinning room is extremely large. We were unfortunate to be there on a Saturday night and were looking forward to a night of rest after a busy day but they had two parties catered that day and we got very little sleep until late that evening.  In short it is a large and clean place but if you expect comfort and sleep, find another location.","3720":"We were out of season and so the Riviera hotel was very quiet while we were there, although we did have the pleasure of some vintage cars over the first weekend who were staying for a rally at the autodromo. The staff were very helpful, the hotel clean and comfortable, the pool excellent and the food in the restaurent good. We dined in every night. It was obviously a hotel more for visiting Italians than English which we enjoyed. We found it a great place to stay for visits to Enna, the Villa Romana and we even managed a day drive to Agrigento from here.","3726":"Only Italians would build a racetrack around a nature reserve and Sicily's only natural lake!  The hotel itself was much better than we expected from the picture - our room was very modern, clean and spacious, and the bathroom was absolutely enormous! Despite the fact that the season had hardly started and we were one of only a few couples staying in the hotel, the food on offer was quite acceptable.  You can even see Etna in the distance from the upper floors on a good day.  Overall, very good value for money - but as another reviewer said, don't miss the entrance! If you, do you have to go another 2 miles around the one-way system round the lake to get back to it.","3750":"Very warm and friendly host. Rooms are big and each with a balcony. Breakfast is fantastic - you sit on the roof and enjoy the overview while enjoying all kinds of sweet and salty breakfast dishes. Very recommended!","3759":"We had some difficulty due to the one-way system finding B&B Centro Sicilia. However the local people were very friendly and one even showed us the location. We called the proprietor who came immediately and guided us to a parking spot. She helped us with our luggage. The two rooms we rented were up several flights of stairs without a lift, although we understand one will be installed this winter. Luckily there was a luggage lift. The rooms were comfortable and clean; the beds were also comfortable. Breakfast was a little walk away at the Hotel Bristol also owned by the proprietor. It was delicious and with plenty of variety.","3785":"We arrived in Messina by train (which was on the ferry) and walked from the station to the B&B Crystal. This was an easy 20 minute walk with our luggage along the main street but we later discovered that the tram from the train station costs only \u20ac2.60 per person for an unlimited travel 24 hour ticket (on tram and busses). The tram stops nearly directly in front of the B&B Crystal and takes only 5 minutes, the tram is also very spacious so getting luggage on and off is easy. Once we arrived at our accommodation nobody was there and after ringing our contact number, a very lovely and helpful young lady came to let us in, so I would suggest you ring or send a message as soon as you arrive at train ferry terminal and give about 20minute notice so you don\u2019t need to wait. The large, open entry foyer at the street level has a lift which was compact but big enough and takes you to the second floor to the B&B Crystal. Once you arrive the place is truly impressive (and we travel a lot), everything was smooth and easy and our spacious room was equally impressive with a very comfortable queen size bed, one of the best showers ever anywhere, private outside courtyard where we had dinners, air con, hair dryer and everything we needed, only improvement would be some hooks on the wall to hang a jacket etc. The common area has a large balcony overlooking the picturesque main street and a good kitchen with a fridge. The hostess organised us vegan breakfasts and a very good supermarket is just one and half block easy walk along the main street. We caught the tram everywhere as it was so convenient from the front and truly must rank B&B Crystal easily the best in its class. Obviously you do not have 24 hour room service but in most other aspects it competes favourably with any other hotel we have ever stayed. I know this review is full of superlatives but in our decades of travel and hundreds of nights in hotels this one does stand out. If you stay here and find that I have in exaggerated in any way, please let me know. Thank you B&B Crystal for making our stay in Messina so pleasant and memorable.","3801":"I absolutely loved staying in this place. Everyting clean, very good, diversified breakfast. Very nice and extremelly helpful people running the place. Central position, 30 sec from the tram stop-just cross the street.","3825":"Stayed here in June, arrived into Enna with nowhere booked to stay, parked away from the main street , the owner of this place was so nice, he walked all the way to our car, got in and came with us to direct us through the narrow streets found us a parking space! The B&B was in a great location, spotless big room and bathroom, free Internet, yummy breakfast, we even got sent on our way with a packed lunch of Parma ham and cheese rolls leftover from breakfast! Great value also, thanks","3843":"This place, while clean once inside the room, was lacking in every other way. Yes, the location was good - nothing special but not inconvenient. I booked what was called a suite on the website and got a large room with indoor-outdoor carpet, barely any heat, and awful, cheesy furniture.  We arrived at the B&B to discover that nobody was on site and had to call a cell phone number to reach the host. It took him 15 to 20 minutes to come and greet us, and although he was nice and friendly, the B&B seemed just plain creepy. The room was very clean, but the entry and stairway leading up to the fourth floor (I think) were very dirty and musty, with peeling paint on the walls. It felt like an abandoned building, with a funky, old hotel on the top floors that was now being called a B&B. The fact that there is no host on site on a regular basis added to the abandoned feeling.  I thought the bed was okay, but my husband found it very uncomfortable and woke up with a backache. The father and son that seem to run the place were kind, but apparently are trying to run a B&B by investing as little as possible in a funky old hotel. Even the curtains were hideous homemade creations and the windows were so dirty that we could not enjoy the view over the city.  This is the worst B&B that I have ever stayed in, which I am sorry to say because the owner and his son did seem kind.","3852":"The positives are that the location was great as it was in the centre of town, so you were central to all the shops, cafes, restaurants, etc. The chuch which is spectacular was a 5-min walk and the castle as 10-min walk. When we arrived I read that parking was an issue so I met a staff member who walked back to our car, directed us to the B&B, waited for us to take all our baggage to our room, then showed us somewhere to park nearby and for free. The rooms are located on the 3rd floor but thankfully they had a luggage lift. We had a 6-month old baby and were able to put his stroller in it, whilst we carried him up the stairs. The other staff member at breakfast was also very polite and extremely friendly  Unfotunately the negative points about B&B was the poor nights sleep we did or didnt get! I would have to say we stayed in 10 different B&Bs all over Sicily and this was the noisiest. Every time someone used the luggage lift it woke us up and that was even after drinking a bottle of wine before going to sleep. Even if the lift wasn't used, guests were arriving late through the night and each time they did, they woke us up. Also the bed was very uncomfortable and again didnt help us get a decent nights rest. We did say to eachother in the morning it had felt like we hadn't been to sleep at all, although the staff were so lovely and the fact we were only staying one night, we decided not to complain. If you are elderly, have mobility problems or just can't do stairs, this is not the B&B for you. I had read that it had a luggage lift, but thought we might be able to get in it. This is not an option and if you see it, you will know why. So we made the decision to make the most of the day ahead and leave straight after breakfast, all be it very tired!","3856":"This is the perfect spot for an Enna stay. The staff at the associate B&B Proserpina are very helpful and obliging. Irena and Vanessa are smiling, friendly girls and happy to help with info and advice. The small lift for luggage is good. The breakfast is excellent with plenty of cheese and cold meat and even yoghurt cake! We extended our 1n stay to 2n as our king size room with modern en suite had 3 doors opening onto a balcony overlooking the little street. The room even had a 3 seated sofa, a desk and small fridge. There is a bakery opposite and a supermarket further up via Roma. Ristorante Centrale is next door and well worth a visit. We went 2 successive nights.","3865":"Very nice b&b, great hospitality, the host did everything to make us feel at home. Breakfast is luxurious and is served by three ladies: omelet at choice, croissants, rolls, tea, coffee, juice, yoghurt, fruit. Water, tea and coffee can be taken at any time. The room has comfortable beds, the bathroom has a large shower, good wifi, nice decoration. Inside much nicer than outside. Traffic in Messina can be a little hectic. Very good location for exploring the city. Highly recommended.","3871":"We found this Bed & Breakfast very centrally situated. The rooms are nicely furnished, very clean and comfortable. The owner and staff were very nice and very helpful. The only negative point is that there are four flights of stairs to get to the rooms, however, there is a lift for luggage. I would definitely stay in this hotel again if I returned to Enna.","3884":"We struck lucky with this hotel! We had a large, comfortable room with good bathroom. Breakfast was not included, but a substantial buffet breakfast was available at a very reasonable price. A small improvement could be made - more fruit and less pastry, please. The hotel is located near one of the main roads in Enna, Via Roma, but access by car is a little tight (narrow accessways) and parking would be difficult if it wasn't for Fabrizio at the hotel, who always found and parked our car for us. Indeed, Fabrizio and the other staff at the hotel were most helpful and always anxious to assist.","3886":"This is a fine hotel, very modern, nice rooms, good soundproofing, clean and tidy. It does not have a restaurant or coffee bar, which makes me wonder why it is rated as a 3 star (normally a hotel needs a restaurant to be a 3-star). That notwithstanding, it's a darn good place to stay and I recommend it.  Breakfast food is limited in scope - almost all sweet pastries, nothing healthy. If you are late getting to breakfast, you will find it pretty well picked over and not much left.  Parking is available out front, but there is no guarantee that parking will be available because in Sicily, people park wherever they want, it is impossible for the hotel to control parking spaces.","3899":"I stayed in this hotel for two nights. The staff were very friendly, breakfast was good, room was clean and had a good view out of our balcony. Wifi worked good in the lobby but not in our room. Great stay overall!","3901":"This is the only time we have stayed in Enna, so we don't know how this hotel compares to others. Our rating is our comparison to other places we stayed in Sicily.  It seemed to us there were many things that needed repair. In our room, there were electronic items that were not sealed. There was no entry light as we entered the room--there was a light there, it just didn't work). The light switch in the bathroom was not by the door -- we had to walk all the way to the far wall of the bathroom (at night, in the dark) to get to it. The light for the desk table could only be switched on by reaching with a foot to a switch behind the table leg. The WiFi in the room was so intermittent it was of no use at all. But if you stand out in the hallway it is better. Breakfast was probably the thing the hotel did best, but even that was just average compared to other places we staying on this trip. And this lodging was the most expensive of any place we stayed. Finally, for people driving cars to this location, of all the places we stayed this was the most difficult place to get to, due to very tight corners.","3902":"Only book as a last resort, this hotel was like an episode Fawlty Towers. The owners would switch off the power, only when you asked they turned it back on, they would switch off the air conditioner, elevators not working on two occasions, no car park, you had to park 20 min. away and catch a shuttle bus back to the hotel. The included breakfast in the price was a joke to say the least. NEVER AGAIN!!!!","3907":"Once you've actually found the hotel, tucked away in ancient back streets, its excellent. Friendly helpful staff with good clean comfortable rooms at reasonable cost. Breakfast was pleasant and adequate especially if you like cake! One word of warning, don't attempt to access it in anything larger than an average car, the streets of this historic mountain top town mitigate against anything any bigger.","3925":"Stayed beginning of October, desolate place not much happening. Modern decor clean rooms, nice pool but overloaded with all inclusive guests so no a la carte restaurant and only option was an expensive 20 euro buffet in the evening but you needed running shoes to get a moderate meal. Breakfast no different. Seems the all inclusive dictates the type of service you will get. Pleasant staff at reception and very helpful. Beach nothing to write home about in fact don't bother it's a mess. Won't be going back to this back of beyond unless they move the hotel somewhere else!!!","3931":"It could be a great time but the administration was not so good. They gave a little room to me and my wife and a big and spacious one to my friends for the same price. I was sad because I\u2019ve made the booking for us. They also promise to fix the air conditioning as it was not working but did nothing. I had to sleep with a wet towel coz it was really hot and when I opened the varanda to cool down a bit, some mosquitos enter and made the night worse. Breakfast was good (average) and included on the price.","3944":"Good day to all. We rested at this hotel in early August 2019. I will not write a lot of text. Rest was excellent, Sicily will remain in my memory forever. I liked the hotel itself. Nice rooms, tidy up in the rize every day. They were well fed, everything was included in us, and after dinner I rolled out like a ball. The hotel has an excellent team of animators who really plow in the morning to evening, well done. Opposite the restaurant, the hotel has a separate bar room where you can sit and dive into your thoughts with a cup of cocktail) Separately, I want to note the employee of the bar a girl named Veridiana. The embodiment of beauty, intelligence, professionalism. She will always tell and tell everything, she was always full-time sweet and smiling. I believe that such employees influence the overall impression of the hotel. In general I advise everyone, all good!","3952":"Siamo stati all'hotel Bristol per un weekend e siamo rimasti piacevolmente colpiti: la stanze sono pulite, la posizione e' molto comoda e il proprietario ci ha trattati come se fossimo a casa nostra! Inoltre, la posizione centrale della struttura consente di raggiungere ogni punto d'interesse della citta'.  We stayed at the Bristol Hotel for a weekend and we were pleasantly surprised: the rooms are clean, the location is very convenient and the owner treated us as if we were at our home! Besides, the central location of the hotel allows you to reach every point of interest in the city.","3955":"Il soggiorno all'hotel Bristol \u00e8 stato piacevole: le camere sono ben pulite, ordinate e la posizione \u00e8 ottima essendo ubicato proprio al centro della citt\u00e0 di Enna. Il personale \u00e8 gentilissimo e ospitale, come solo i siciliani sanno essere. Consigliato.  The stay at Bristol Hotel has been very delightful: rooms are pretty clean, tidy and position is optimal since the building is placed at the very centre of Enna. The staff is so much kind with guests, as only sicilian people can be. Suggested.","4025":"To say that you feel conned by visiting this hotel would be an under statement. Firstly it is literally in the middle of nowhere and the beach is about 10 foot wide with loads of rubbish and concrete. The staff are extremely unfriendly and all the time are trying to make more money out of you. All inclusive means that spirits are only available for 4 hours in the evening and the local wine and beer is horrendous. no proper coke or fanta but just the hotel stuff made fron syrup and gas. If you miss breakfast (where all the limited croissants go within the first half an hour) then you have to wait for a very basic lunch at 1.00. No snacks available at all unless you pay. The so called animation team sat on their butts and did nothing except go and sleep in hidden places aor make out with each other. Their so called games were pathetic and for this reason nobody joined in and even if you did they spoke italian to you even though most of the guests were polish. Only one nice girl that spoke English - Heidi. The rooms were not cleaned properly and if you put a wet towel on the floor it was put back on the rail for use!!Dinner was the only reasonable thing but again if you were not there within the first half hour then forget it! Waiters just stood there and did nothing and if you asked them for something they shrugged their shoulders. The exercise gym was out of action and the spa was closed and had been broken up and destroyed The lounge downstairs was permanently closed and the whole area was filthy and covered with cigarette butts!!! Plus algae growing in the pool!! Please take my advice and avoid at all costs!!","4049":"Money was stolen from our room. Management and front-desk staff was really unhelpful throughout the complaint and claiming process with police and insurance company. No money was ever returned. 1700 euros extracted from our room. It spoiled our visit entirely. This is an average hotel, not very safe. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.","4104":"We originally chose this hotel for the location for our one night stay - it was an awesome place to stay! The hotel was furnished in a cool, contemporary style, had large rooms, a cozy bar, a good breakfast and a terrific, friendly and extremely helpful owner. Antonio sent us to a terrific restaurant for dinner and the next morning sat down with us to be our travel guide for Sicily! Great service and overnight stay.","4143":"About an hour before we were due to arrive we gained a message from the B & B checking on time of arrival which was a nice touch. When we arrived they were waiting for us and helped park the car. Lovely area in the old town, the entrance was lovely and clean and we were taken to our room which was bright and airy. We had a Balcony looking over a few of the old town property which was very nice. The B & B also recommened where to eat which was a bonus as we were only staying 1 night. Great stay - thank you.","4147":"We have spent two enchanting weeks being spoiled and pampered by Marilisa and Emiliano, feeling like family. Breakfasts are unforgettable, nicely served to satisfy both Sicilian and international tastes, with plenty of fresh and homemade food. We also enjoyed local excursions, under our hosts guidance, including water sports for our kids at Nicoletti Dam, an amazing and relaxing place for everyone. Looking forward to go back, definitely.","4156":"Basic but very good air con good in heat no frills basic breakfast seems family run Service top draw. Booked for us by Railbookers as part of an overall 14 day rail trip holiday. Beds very comfortable. Can't think of anything else","4236":"Francesco hosts you on seventh floor above main pedestrian street that has amenities you need. We had the very modern room with a large furnished terrace where we had breakfast each morning with our friends from down the hallway. One checks a large sheet each nite for what you want and the time you wish. Precisely at the appointed time he delivers a cart to your room to enjoy your terrace breakfast!\r Bathroom very modern and spacious as well. Two elevators whisk you from the building entry to seventh floor. Mattress is very comfortable and I slept like a log each nite!\r B&B located in modern business portion of Palermo. It\u2019s a great city with much to explore and easily done from your B&B!\r Our host, wife and lovely young daughter live immediately next to our room","4240":"The location of the B&B is ideal, on the 7th floor of a building on a pedestrian only street a few minutes walk from one of the main streets in Palermo. It\u2019s easy walking distance to the Catherdral and other tourist attractions and a 10 minute walk to the port and about 15-20 minutes to the main rain station.\r \r The rooms are large and each one has a terrace with views over the surrounding area (and in some cases down to the sea). This was very peaceful for relaxing and also where breakfast was served. There is a built in robe for clothes storage and a table and chairs in the room.\r \r Although the location is very central, because it is a pedestrian only street there is no traffic noise and so is very quiet. There are electronic shutters which can be closed at nighttime which completely shut out any noise.\r \r I absolutely loved the very modern decor, it\u2019s obviously had an interior designer\u2019s touch.\r \r Francesco the host is incredibly welcoming and happy to provide a local map and recommendations of things to see.\r \r Overall it was a wonderful stay, definitely the best B&B I have stayed in at Italy. I would highly recommend this place to anyone staying in Palermo.\r \r One tip on arrival: the door to the B&B is via an apartment building entrance on the ground floor between two shops, the button to press to call for entry is on the left hand side.","4242":"My daugter and I spent 3 nights at this B&B. It's in a prime location in Palermo--right in the middle of the shopping district. Located on the top floor of an apartment building, each room has it's own wonderful terrace overlooking the pedestrian only street. Our apartment was modern, super clean, large, and well appointed. A large bathroom, clothes closet, mini fridge stocked with free water, a small area for tea, the bedroom area and the very large terrace equipped with nice patio furniture. The beds and pillows were comfortable, and there were plenty of outlets for devices. Although the room faced the street, it was very quiet at night, and we had no problems sleeping. A very tasty breakfast was served in our room, at the hour we specified. I'm leaving the best part of our B&B experience for last. the very best part was the amazing, kind, generous, lovely husband and wife team who own and run Bella Vita. The owners also happen to live on the same floor, and always available if you have questions or need help. They were so helpful to us when I got sick, so friendly and warm. It's so clear how much they enjoy meeting new people and making them feel welcome. Grazie mille!","4254":"La Bella Vita located 5minutes walk from the airport shuttle,on pedestrian street,on the 7th floor. Secure entrance to the building with a concierge. We stayed at the room with terrace and sea view. Breakfast was served at the terrace in good weather and inside when it rained( you are given a menu list every day to fill out, menu is somewhat limited,no hot items,such as omlettes,etc, but sufficient. Modern and clean rooms,which had mini fridge(water,soft drinks and beers are for a fee), kettle,free instant cofee,teas,etc. great location in walking distance to port and to all central Palermo attractions. Friendly host.","4256":"The location of the B&B was excellent. We were in the centre of town and within walking distance of everything. Francisco who was the manager and owner was absolutely fantastic. Smiling all the time and eager to help whatever we needed. Breakfast was served on the room terrace. I highly recommend this location and this B&B.","4260":"Our double room was clean and modern. The host Francesco very friendly, helpful and accomodating. He arranged a pickup of our car on arrival and then the car was promptly returned on requested time in the morning. The only minor negatives were the occasional fishy smell from the drainage in the bathroom and the instant coffee served for breakfast (really espresso only up to italian standards) but nearby (just downstairs) coffee bars and streetfood compensate this completely and at a very reasonable price. Would definitely return here in the future. Thanks Francesco.","4265":"Francesco is a wonderful host, patient with all our questions and very committed to providing the best possible experience of Palermo. We stayed in 2 rooms - a large one with terrace and the small one on our last night - thanks Francesco for organising this -and enjoyed it immensely. Rooms are perfect for use as a base. Palermo is a very walkable city.","4267":"The room was clean and a nice size, with a comfortable bed and lovely terrace. Francesco was so very gracious and helpful. The hotel was centrally located and we just loved our breakfasts on the terrace","4272":"Our room was bright, comfortable, modern and had a pleasant private terrace. It's located a 5 minute walk from the Politeama bus stop for the airport shuttle bus and less than 15 minutes to the Quattro Canti area. The people running the b&b couldn't be friendlier or more willing to help. The rooms are located on an upper floor of building on a quiet pedestrian street. Our room had a terrace, which was a quiet place to relax and have breakfast. If there was one weak link, it would be that the breakfast -- it was delivered to our terrace, which was great --- not bad, but only adequate. We would definitely stay here again and recommend La Bella Vita","4274":"La Bella Vita is a delightful B&B! My boyfriend and I spent three nights in the deluxe double room with balcony. The room was very clean and just the right size for us. The deck was spacious and overlooked the pedestrian zone below which was fun for people watching. Being situated over a pedestrian walkway also meant it was quiet (by Palermo standards). Francesco is a superb host\u2014very friendly and helpful, offering great restaurant recommendations and letting us know which of Palermo\u2019s many sights shouldn\u2019t be missed. He is usually around if you have questions and is also easy to reach by text. Breakfasts were enjoyable. Make sure you order the yogurt - it is homemade! We were even given free homemade chocolate cake a couple of times which was very thoughtful. We had a great time at La Bella Vita!","4278":"We stayed at Bianko&Bianko in May 2013 on the second leg of our cross Sicily cycling adventure. We can fully recommend this delightful B&B which is both decorated in a style which can't fail to relax and is very reasonably priced too. Breakfast was enormous, fresh and included a choice of many local specialities. We found the mattress in our bedroom a little soft for our personal tastes but did not prevent a sound night's sleep after a long day in the saddle and wonderful climb up to Enna itself. Would definitely stay here again if we are lucky enough to be able to repeat our cycling holiday in Sicily.","4297":"We stayed for a week in September. Our room was excellent and Francesco was the perfect host, genuinely helpful and always on hand to answer any questions we had. Great value for money too, and good location to reach all of the city's landmarks.","4318":"Do yourself a favour and use this place as your base in Palermo . Fantastic central location . The room was excellent and they also had a lovely 7th floor balony were breakfast is served . The hosts were really lovely and friendly .","4353":"The hotel location is very nice and convenient to walk to many places in Messina center such as the cathedral, etc. The architecture is really nice with high ceilings and big windows in the room.The room was clean. However, the flooring was laminate and peeling in some places. It needs refreshed. The breeakfast was really terrible. Some of the staff members don't know how to make cappuccino and this is in Italy! A bit surprising. I resorted to having an espresso after attemtping twice to get a decent cappuccino. Hope the hotel updates the interiors. Price was good though. The hotel offered us free private parking in front of the hotel.","4373":"Stayed at this hotel one night, we booked on bookings.com to pay at hotel but the guy had already taken payment before we arrived. The guy at front desk very rude and arrogant. Rooms were spacious and clean but they turned off aircon in the middle of the night so rooms were hot ,so you need to open windows and it became very noisy so you didn\u2019t get much sleep. Breakfast was not great but what really turned us off was the arrogance of the young man at front desk , would not stay there again.","4396":"This Hotel is good value, the staff try to make you feel comfortable, They are friendly and hospitable. I jave nothing but praise for the staff and the hotel. It is equidistant from the shopping centre, the old town centre and the railway station. There are good restaurants nearby.","4451":"I stayed in this B&B in a rural neighborhood of Enna in early October, 2012. Because it is in an area of sparse housing and orchards, I thought it would be quiet. The owners speak little English, but we worked things out. The house is on three levels, and the rooms are on the second floor adjacent to and opening on a large patio. The room was quite nice and well-equipped, although the TV quit working. I would have been comfortable that night had it not been for the neighborhood dogs which barked all night and, some nightclub nearby played very loud music well into the night. The yard was a disappointment. The pool was an unpleasant sight, empty as expected for this time of year, and the grounds were not attractive. The parking was in a dirt lot where, unfortunately, the dog prefers to poop, so you have to watch your step. Payment was strictly cash and the price was a bit high for this quality of lodging. Overall, I was somewhat disappointed. This was not the best lodging I had on my Sicily trip.","4462":"B&b was very clean. Our room situated at the top had breath taking views. Room was very clean. Host Maria and her family were super friendly and helpful. I would definately reccommend others to stay at this b&b.","4469":"Located in walking distance between the Messina Railway Station and the Cathedral, Hotel Sant'Elia is a good choice. Modern, comfortable bedroom and bath. Good breakfast buffet. Friendly, helpful staff.","4486":"Located a half hour by car from Villa Romana do Casale and the Archeological Museum of Aidone on south and hilltop stone villages around Emma, Pollicarini was in the ideal spot. The hotel is very picturesque and evocative, and both breakfast and dinners were plentiful. We went off season, but the pool looked lovely. Make sure to allow time to stroll through the olive groves.","4492":"This Agriturismo is set in a renovated monastery that retains a lot of history and beautiful old stone architecture, but has all the modern conveniences, including a beautiful pool. Our room was very nice, clean and comfortable. The setting of Baglio Pollicarini is lovely, amid olive trees and overlooking rolling hills and farmland. The restaurant is quite good and the breakfast is excellent, served in a quiet, leafy courtyard. Nice place!","4508":"Chosen for accessibility to towns we we wanted to visit nearby, the accommodation was in wonderful setting. Imaginatively and sympathetically restored convent. We were the only four there at the time, so we made use of the huge sitting room adjoining one of our rooms. Bathrooms were small and wet rooms! So some coordination needed. Unfortunately evening meals were not available, another reason we had chosen the place. However we made use of a reasonable hotel one night, and improvised a good meal from the excellent local supermarket the next night, as we wanted so much to be at the accommodation. A swim in the excellent pool with Etna in the background is a must.","4577":"We chose the Alcova rooms which have high ceilings, nineteenth century frescoes and, specially the larger one, loads of space including an extra z-bed. This is a really friendly place to stay. The pool is cool and fresh, and not over chlorinated. The young Filipina Nelleen (sp?) - a real asset, with good English too - looked after us beautifully. Meals here are great as you'd expect on an organic olive farm. The olives really are the best, but we loved all the Sicilian dishes; it's very hard not to over-eat here. The one problem is sadly not the agriturismo's fault: while the setting is rural, hilly and pretty with no road noise, a pack of dogs belonging to a neighbour can be heard at times. We wish the farm best of luck in sorting this out.","4701":"Went to Emme at the time required and the door was locked. I called and no one answered. I waited hours to no avail. Left and came back later door was still locked. Met the man who lived next door he tried to help, he said they are usually open. He called and no one answered again. I had to go to another hotel.","4710":"My husband and I spent two nights at the B& B Kore. The room was clean and the double bed was very comfortable. We had a lovely balcony overlooking the parking lot. The couple who run this B & B are very friendly and gave us excellent tips. The only drawback is that they cannot speak English although this was not a problem for us as we are able to understand and speak Italian. The breakfast was a little bit poor just a coffee and cornetto (excellent). I would recommend this B & B to everyone who would like to have their base in Enna as parking is no problem. We were unable to connect to internet although we were given a code for access. We wish the owners of Kore success.","4719":"I had pleasure to stay in B&B Kore. Since I am traveling a lot and had an opportunity to stay in plenty of hotels, hostels, B&B, etc., a few days spent in B&B Kore Enna were the greatest in my life. I would like to highlight the hospitality of Giusy and Luigi, the owners of the B&B. They met me after office hours in the town center and kindly accompanied to the apartment. Moreover, I they introduced me with the town life and events which were at that time. I will be always grateful for the lovely time and pleasant stay in a typical Sicilian town and delicious typical breakfast (cappuccino and briosh!!!!)  I would also like to draw your attention to the apartment by itself. It was well maintained, stylish and, of course, irreproachable clean and tidy.  I strongly recommend you to stay in B&B Kore.","4732":"Hi. I like to share my experience of my stay in this B&B ARMONIA in Pergusa Enna,\r We were three men with our motorbikes travelling around Sicily ,our second stay was in Pergusa ,this was my second stay here last time was 2018 September, the place and the room is very clean the breakfast was very good and the service very friendly, (maybe I always get a friendly service is because I myself I am very friendly and I can speak good Italian). There is a good safe parking for the Motorbikes, The price is not that cheap, but still not too much expensive but it was only for one night so it was not a problem.\r Thanks","4742":"Nice little Hotel..very clean and friendly staff. Situated in a small beautiful town Villarosa and only about 20-30 minutes far from Sicilia Outlet Village in Enna.\r Recommended for those who are in search for an inexpensive and nice little hotel.","4770":"It was a nice stay in the hotel, but it was below our expectations as we were waiting more of a 4 star hotel. the quality of the breakfast was poor. the room was very nice but there was a lot of noise in the morning","4773":"We had an amazing experience at this hotel. We stayed on the top floor, which had some fantastic views. The rooms were fairly well appointed and comfortable. The hotel was within waling distance of everything. Staff were all friendly and professional. Breakfast was solid and the staff helped us park our massive camper van in a nearby garage, then brought it to us when we checked out. We were very pleased!","4792":"Right between the more luxurious shopping district and the old center of Palermo we stayed in this very nice hotel. Good rooms, clean bathrooms, great breakfast and very friendly staff make this definitely a good choice at very decent prices","4803":"Another reviewer was on point when he wrote, \u201cNothing seriously wrong with Mercure, but you might find better options more \u2018centrale.\u2019\u201d I\u2019ve been here two nights, and dislike this hotel. First, the shower is tiny\u2014at an athletic 6 feet, I can barely fit inside. Second, breakfast is unremarkable. I usually eat yogurt, water, and cereal (though they have bread, salami, and cheese as well). I wish I\u2019d have stayed at ibis Styles instead. (November 2019)","4804":"Our agent booked this hotel for us so - as unlike the rest of Italy - this was our first trip to Palermo and so we had no prior experience. the hotel is modern, clean and comfortable in all respects however there are a few ifs and buts. The oddest one being we arrived on a Sunday by air from Florence and went looking for some lunch. The hotel restaurant was closed, so we went out. Everything was closed in the area, not even a humble bar. We went back to the Mercure and to the bar which was open and appeared to offer bar snacks We were told this was not possible.We decided then on room service only to be told that the kitchen was closed. The hotel info sheet said not, but we were told this was wrong. We went back to the bar to drown our sorrows when further prodding produced a ham and chess sandwich. Very odd. Another guest travelling alone told us he was refused seating at a table for two in the restaurant (plenty of tables available)as this was a table set for two and he was just one...he was being directed to join other people at a larger table.until he insisted and was finally permitted to sit at a table for two. More odd behavior on the dining front. The staff are efficient and while not rude, they are not engaging. The area around Mercure is seriously grubby, making the hotel something of a clean oasis, but it is not as centrale as you might imagine, requiring a cab ride to practically anywhere of interest unless you'r keen on walking long distances. Nothing seriously wrong with Mercure, but you might find better options more centrale.","4805":"This hotel though very old has been totally renovated. It is centrally located. Stayed there twice. Clean rooms and bathrooms. The beds (as in most of Italy) are pretty hard as well as the pillows. They serve Breakfast every day. I would stay there again.","4814":"This is a comfy and clean 4 star hotel. It is moderately priced so with that in mind it is a good honest 4 star hotel. Staff are lovely, breakfast a good standard given the price and rooms are very well maintained by cleaning staff. Whilst the location isnt fantastic it is quiet for those who like to sleep in.","4816":"With my wife we spent 3 nights in this b&b We liked the location, the room with a stylish bathroom and great shower. Mattress and pillows were very comfortable. The aircon it is very quiet. We also liked the breakfast which can be taken at the local Bar with great atmosphere. Cristina is amazing and very helpful. I really suggest this place.","4819":"We had booked the room several months in advance before travelling. After a long day of travel, upon arrival we were given a room away from the hotel in a nondescript apartment block. We informed the management of our displeasure and were given a room in the hotel the following day. A very disappointing and unhappy start to our holiday.","4821":"I recently stayed here as part of a group and enjoyed my time there. It does seem as if some rooms are better than others, ours was quite small but it didn\u2019t matter as the bed was comfortable, the shower was excellent and lots of fluffy towels. The location is perfect, so close to so many of the sites in Palermo. The reception and bar were extremely pleasant. Unlike the review below, I thought the breakfast was wonderful...scrambled eggs, bacon, cereals, yoghurt, fruit, pastries, what more could you ask for!! There are lots of lovely restaurants close to the hotel and the foyer was a lovely place to sit and have a drink. I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel. Grazie a tutti.","4825":"We were enjoying our first trip to Sicily visiting first Catania and staying at the wonderful Asmundo di Gisira hotel then we spent three lovely nights at the foothills of Mt Etna. There we stayed at Monaci Della Terre Nere which was a dream hotel. We were given a gorgeous cottage room overlooking the vineyards and the sea. Then we arrived at the Mercure Palermo Centro. What a disappointment! We were charged over 500 euros for a room the first night which did not compare to the rooms we were given in the first two hotels for double the price. When we complained to the manager, he told us that the rates for this room may vary from 50+ euros to 700+ euros depending on availability! We felt scammed! The hallways were narrow and smelly, and always blocked with the cleaning people's carts during the day. Then we went to have breakfast which was included in the daily room charge and again what a disappointment! It was a very poor buffet breakfast with limited choices. The only good thing about this hotel is its central location which enabled us to escape this lousy breakfast and instead go to the wonderful pastry shop Spinnato for our breakfast and cappucino. I would not recommend this hotel in Palermo.","4832":"Although a big tour bus hotel stop it is pretty good. A nice breakfast, decent sized rooms especially for Europe. Some AC problems but addressed and corrected quickly. Good multilingual staff at desk.","4846":"Centrally located in Palermo with most attractions being only a short walk away! The rooms are a little dated and not what I would have expected from a Mercure hotel. Also the room I stayed in was exceptionally small and again, not what I would have expected from Mercure! Breakfast was excellent however!","4853":"A very well located hotel, the door is reached in the center even on foot in 7-10 minutes, restaurants and market very close to the hotel, a quite area, very spacious room, we had a room with 2 double beds, very personal staff responsive to the needs of customers, I had a problem with the mini bar and was changed in one hour, excellent breakfast very rich, although it does not have a very pleasant view is an excellent hotel with enough peace for a pleasant stay, I look forward to but I'm back in Palermo","4860":"Cairoli Guest House is perfect - central to city, clean and spacious. Stayed 3 nights. Francesca is brilliant and good at welcoming guests - she even brought a friend who spoke English so we didn't miss out on any information. Prompt when she said she would meet us to let us in to the room. There were even snacks & drinks for our stay - so welcomed and not expected There was a guide book in English for the whole of Sicily and I used it as my 'bible' for planning the rest of the Sicily trip. It is a pity that other guests have abused this gift and tore pages out of the book. Bad manners on their part. I would definitely come back to stay. Can I score it 6 5 ?","4868":"We spent one night in Messina on our way to Stromboli, with our 2 kids. The room was just perfect, and kitchen very clean and convenient. The host has been very nice and patient with us. I highly recommend for a stopover in Messina.","4874":"This hotel is absolutely strange. make sure you are careful when reserving a room, we reserved a room and forgot to mention the kids, they were telling us you have to sleep in a single bed. Th double rooms are very small and basic and our room was overlooking an apt very close by. the rates are also another strange factor, never seen a hotel charging 60 euro one night and two days later 400 euro. Really am interested to know what kind of a naive person would pay 400 euro for this hotel, when there is Sofitel close by. The location of central Palermo is the only thing going for this hotel.. does not deserve more than one star.","4880":"Very disappointed by this hotel! We had 2 rooms, one over the street and the second one overlooking a shabby courtyard. The first one was probably the best but the only a c unit in this big room was not enough and the bathroom stank of sewage. In the second room the a c was no better but the room was smaller. In both rooms the a c unit covers were made of several small plastic pieces that were not attached to anything, just loose.  Breakfast was just OK , fruits were not ripe and the cooked food was very basic.  Very disappointed !","4882":"Nice modern hotel close to Palermo's attractions. Rooms are spacious (at least the premium ones, with an extra cost) Unfortunately there are no views in the city. Breakfast was also quite good . Rooms were clean and air-condition was working well. Overall a good choice if you want to stay in the center. Only service level has to be improved.","4885":"1 night stopover in Messina and we were very satisfied with our accommodation. Room was spacious, very clean and shower was excellent. Accommodation is a 5 min walk to the train station so also very central. We would stay here again if in Messina","4889":"First of all this is NOT a new hotel that it states on TripAdvisor. The hotel need to update this,as it's false advertising and misleading. On arrival we were given an old tiny room with tiny windows, which got no natural light, so we changed rooms to a slightly bigger one, with a very basic balcony, with no table or chairs. The room was old and tired. The net curtains were like rags, grey with holes all over them, there was even a few stitches in part of it to try and mend. Throw the things out and don't be mean not to buy new ones!!! Blood   makeup like stains on sheets. Stained carpet. Tired furnishings. Music loud in corridor. A c hopeless. It was so comfortable, as was the corridors. We felt suffocated and sweaty. The reception area was slightly cool but not brilliant. No iron!!! They will iron for you for fee. Absolute joke. Noway a 4star hotel! Told us they weren't allowed to give an iron to guests. Then how come all other Accor hotels, including Italy can provide an iron to guests! Drilling heard at 7.50 am. On checkout male receptionist was ignorant. No thank you, no, how was your stay. Disgraceful hotel and service.","4894":"This was our first time at the hotel all was good except the AC didn\u2019t work as good as it should have, we are going to stay there one time before heading back to the states let\u2019s see if they can fix it!","4913":"Great room, lovely bathroom, comfy bed and water bottles provided in the kitchen along with tea and coffee facilities. Wasn't able to find the place on arrival but the owner came and found me to show me where to go. Short walk from the train and bus station (5-10minutes) an easy walk to the square near the astronomical clock. Positioned very close to lots of shops and cafes. Only thing was no map available and would have liked to know that to take a trip on a boat to the islands you must go to Milazzo first. Would highly recommend this place.","4937":"been there for the night as i had my sleeping bag at a friends .... meaning that it would have been better if i had slept on a street bench ...although chinese cleaning guy was kind owners father and son in this case are rude uneducated and unprofessional worst kind of persons ever to deal with without entering in details for the structure one tip for travellers burn these 30 eyros instead of spending it there","4954":"Stayed here for 3 nights as a family - needed to stay near this location due to friends nearby. We had the whole B&B as a family - the top level had 2 separate double rooms with their own bathroom. Very clean and comfortable with a kitchen and stocked up pantry fridge for breakfast. Owners are very friendly and helpful. The wifi wasn't great so keep this in mind if you need constant connection. Although whenever we advised the owners, they were very helpful and tried to fix it immediately. Keep in mind that the owners do not have credit card facilities so they might ask you to transfer funds prior to arrival - which could be difficult if you are already travelling at the time. So might be an idea to arrange this prior to departing on your holiday. Would stay here again without hesitation.","5068":"There was a problem with my reservation that the hotel refused to fix. Avoid it. I have never found a hotel to be so rude and unwilling to help with a reservation. Unfriendly, unwilling to find a solution. Very strange for Sicily where people tend to be very welcoming and flexible. I would certainly avoid it.","5084":"The hotel is a bit tired but it is clean and convenient. The shower is a bit tight but otherwise this is a good place to stay to explore Palermo. The breakfast buffet is a biot limited but sufficient to fuel your morning excursions. The staff carries the day for attentiveness to guests needs.","5098":"We stayed here for four nights. It is easy to get too from the railway and bus stations. The hotel is up a flight of stairs to get to an elevator and the hotel was on the third floor. The room was quiet and clean as was the whole hotel. The staff were all pleasant and helpful and spoke good English. The breakfast was standard Italian but was let down bas the coffee machine was broken and coffee was microwaved.","5109":"I have very mixed feelings about this place. It has an excellent location relative to the market area the four corners and the train staion. The staff was friendly and helpful and the room was clean. They have an elevator. The hotel is old and the room lacked charm. The air conditioner was noisy and the plumbing gurgled. The bathroom was a triangle built into the room with a shower with a door barely room to open. We are seasoned travelers and have stayed in many places worse. We would go back because of the fine staff and efficient location, but I know some would find a room like the one we had unacceptable.","5111":"I dont want to be negative here but have got to be honest whatever you do dont book here if elderly.. as they have no access whatsoever on entering the hotel in the evening you have to climbe through a small door as the entrance is locked you enter what would have been a grand building in its day but now seems almost haunted and youre met by a very strong musty smell..a tiny old lift takes you to the second floor after a hot stressfull journey all as we wanted was to sit and get a cold drink it says on hotel description 24 hour bar on entering reception to find bar and were told there wasnt one ??so we asked for beers we were given warm bottles of beer on asking for ice ..no ice when complained about this saying it was totally unacceptable we were impolitly told to go to bed..room and beds were clean and comfortable but there are no coolers or fridge to keep drinks. in present day this is crazy.breakfast was very unhealthy not a single boiled egg insight no fruit or fresh juice.you are met with cordial juice and plates of sticky pastries and cakes with no covers over them cheese and salami and thats youre lot no milk nothing was topped up for the money we paid for this even on a non regundable booking it was an outrage.we stayed similar hotel last year in sardinia that would put this place to shame and halfe the price..it says bars restaurants are in close proximety..you are near nothing..the only thing close is a lidle supermarket you can be charged between 10 and 14 euros in a taxi to the nearest bars which are very expensive.via roma is vast very busy but also very dated as for sights the nearest to here is fonrana pethora but how reveiwers are saying within reasonable walking distance is crazy.bus network seemed far too difficult to understand it takes 30 minutes to mondello beach in a taxi god knows how long on a bus and 25 euros each way and it was 17 euros to the capucin catacombes if you choose to stay in palermo then ide advise you to bring a credit card or three as you will need them hotel is even aware taxi firm they use are robbing people blind hotel ambasciatori seemed alot better on location and facilities but on a personal level youde be much wiser to stay in mondello the beach is beutifull swerve palermo city itself as a base just day trip it .","5125":"On our vacation in Palermo we stayed at Hotel del Centro for 10 days and it was one pleasant and comfortable stay. I would recommend this hotel to anyone, not only for a short stay but also for a longer vacation. The rooms are exeptionally clean and spacious, bright, with high ceilings (you can \u201cbreathe\u201d in the room) and authentic well maintained furniture. Daily cleaning service and towel changing. In some reviews it was said that it was a problem that the air conditioning in the rooms was controlled by the reception but I must say that was one of the biggest pluses of the hotel. In other hotels you can not have the air condition running while you are away from the room, and when you come back the rooms are allways hot and humidy and that was not the case in this hotel. After a long day on the beach or walking around the city we enjoyed that the room was cool and air conditioned. The balconies overlook the beautiful narrow streets of Palermo but are on the quieter side and you can sleep well. The building is old but the hotel is in a perfect condition. It is located in the center of the city on one of the main streets in the historical center of Palermo, so you can experience the spirit of the city at its finest and also a short walk from most sights of the city you\u2019ll probably want to visit. The bus stops of the main bus lines are very close as well as the Central railway and bus station so you can easily manage your day trips to other cities and beaches in Sicily. Plenty of restaurants and cafes nearby. Big plus: Lidl supermarket right across the hotel. The breakfast was delicious. Big variety of fresh pastries and bread, biscuits, traditional sicilian treats like cannoli, crispy croissants, jams, salami and cheese, all kinds of coffee and the best thing is that the breakfast room has three balconies that overlook the busy street and the other old buildings where you can eat your breakfast and drink your coffee while enjoying the view. The staff was very polite and always helpfull for whatever you need. Everything was just perfect. Overall, excellent quality for the price. Book directly at the hotel for a lowest rate.","5129":"Three star hotel near railway station and close to main commercial Street. On a second floor of a building offer a very pleasant stay with comfortable rooms and classical common areas. Good breakfast will help you start visiting this wonderful town full of treasures to be discivered. Staff is friendly and professional as Nicol\u00f2 will sole all your problems. Is a very good rate as quality price","5134":"The hotel is in the 2nd floor of a building..there are stairs to the elevator..bear this in mind when travelling with luggage. Breakfast was basic. It's close to the central station and there's a supermarket on the opposite side of the street.","5137":"I stayed here one night during a vacation when I was stranded in Palermo for one night due to flight delays.  In summary, this hotel is acceptable for one night if you're short on options and can accept accept a low standard and staff that is lacking in both English and service skills. The one positive thing is that it is close to the central station (5 min walk).  My room had a dirty floor, you cannot control the AC and have to ask the front desk to activate it. Power outlets were in poor condition and I hesitated to use them. Bathroom was fairly clean but in poor condition. Walls are poorly isolated so you can hear the neighboring rooms and floor above.  They do not offer much for breakfast, more sweets than actual food. Though I suppose that is standard in this part of Europe.  If you're paying more than 50\u20ac night for this, you're being robbed.","5139":"We Arrived to palermo for 3 nights. The Hotel locatd near all the main sights. Nice clean rooms. The service is very fast and kind. Staff is always helpfull. We Loved the breakfast. Highly Recommended .","5141":"Hotel came up as part of our package \u2013 located in the centre of Palermo, the Hotel Del Centro is roughly 150m from the Palermo bus train station. If flying into Palermo Airport, simply get a bus from the Airport via the Prestia e Comand\u00e8 desk (a return will cost 10 Euros and last 7 days, singles are 6 Euros) and then walkalong Via Roma.  The one thing that might strike you as you walk along Via Roma for the first time is that as streets go, it might be busy but it\u2019s not the prettiest \u2013 graffiti rules along the way and you might think you\u2019ve walked into a crime-ridden Gotham City street on a hot summers day\u2026.but don\u2019t let that deter you because the area is a good area and the hotel itself is very good. It is only a couple of streets away from the historical area and the information centre so tourists shouldn\u2019t have much of a problem finding your way around in the area.  There are no language problems to be concerned about here, the staff are all English-speaking and checking in is easy to do. The rooms have a vintage look about them but they are very clean and the bathrooms are functional too. The showers though are criminally small and there\u2019s not a lot of space to move around in\u2026if you drop any items in the shower you\u2019ll have to turn it off, open the shower door just to bend down and grab it. There\u2019s no amenities for tea-making in the room but for any bottles of water you want (plus anything extra such as toothpaste, shaving foam should you forget to bring some *cough*) you will have to visit the supermarket across the road \u2013 it\u2019s a Lidl, it gets busy fast so expect some queueing but it has more than what you\u2019ll need for your break. Some reviews have mentioned noise being a factor; here I would say that perhaps the walls are a bit thin but if you sleep with ear plugs as I do then I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll have a problem since I slept pretty well every night. Each room is air-conditioned and believe me, you\u2019ll need it\u2026.but the rooms are very comfortable overall.  Breakfasts here are superb, run from 7.30am-10.30am (Italian time) and you\u2019d be a fool to pass this up. They are great quality and you will find a typical Italian selection here.  Free WiFi is available and for the most part it works but where we were based the signal did tend to drop a few times but this was a minor niggle for us.  Another minor niggle is that when leaving the room for going into Palermo itself (or out on a tour) you will have to leave your key with reception. I am not accustomed to this myself but know that it can be a rule in some hotels \u2013 but I like the freedom to go and come as I please. Where this \u201crule\u201d can be a bind is that after 8pm the staff close a huge door on the premises that can only be accessed via buzzer to reception. Whilst reception is 24-hour you can expect to be held waiting for someone to respond. This only happened a couple of times to my partner and I but at times once you are tired and just want to get back to the comfort of your room you\u2019re denied this and it can be a tad inconvient\u2026but that\u2019s all it is, a convenience and not a major issue. After all, given the state of the street the large door is recommended!  Given the price we paid for 7 nights (coming to 50 Euros a night) we felt that this was a very good hotel and we would absolutely recommend it to anyone planning on visiting.","5151":"We stayed in this hotel prior to joining a guided tour of Sicily and we were very pleased with our choice. We were greeted warmly when we arrived and check-in was speedy. Were we provided with a map of Palermo and asked if we needed any help with getting to attractions. Our room was roomy, the bed and pillows were very good, and the bathroom was quite nice for an older, but well maintained hotel. There was lots of hot water for showering. Breakfast was excellent and there was lots of choice. As a bonus there is a supermarket directly across the road from the hotel. All the sights we took in before we joined our tour were no more than a 15 minute walk from the hotel, so the location was very good. Book directly to get the best rate. This is not a Hilton, but provided great value for this price range. We would stay here again.","5157":"A very lovely and traditional hotel perfectly placed just a short walk from the station. We arrived a little early but that wasn\u2019t a problem. After the usual formalities we were shown to our room and we were soon relaxing. We\u2019d taken the shuttle bus from the airport and were dropped in Via Roma but the better thing is to get off at the station and walk the short distance back. We never quite explored as fully as we","5169":"We stayed 9 nights in this hotel in a spacious room. We liked the avaibility of the staff at the reception. They gave us excellent advice for excursions. The two ladies serving the breakfast were very nice. Concerning the location, if you plan to visit sites by train or bus, it is very practical because it take 5-7 minutes to go to the train bus station. You can also walk to historical districts of Palerme.","5171":"We stayed in Hotel del Centro for one night before a tour and found it met our needs with no issues. Clean, friendly staff and located near the train station. The street that it is on is a very busy one and central to Palermo's tour sites. There are good restaurants to walk to and the hotel is surprisingly quiet at night.","5173":"The helpful and friendly welcome set the tone for our holiday at the Hotel del Centro. The room was exceptionally comfortable (and with good comfy beds) and quiet too. Breakfast offered a good range of cold meats with cheese and a really good range of tasty croissants and yoghurts and fruit. The location was perfect with the Royal areas of the city within a short walk and also the artistic quarter on the other side of Via Roma. I would definitely return again to this hotel and it is a pleasure to find good old fashioned customer service still exists.","5237":"This is a very beautiful b&b. Historic yet renovated building, The rooms are spacious, very clean and well equipped. What made our stay truly special was the level of hospitality provided by the owner. Dadda was amazing.She provided helpful information for the area which made our visit even more special. We'll definitely be back!","5251":"In a renovated period building in the heart of Messina, casa di Dadda has a lovely interesting arty decor, very comfortable spacious rooms (great shower!) close to all amenities in Messina. Excellent service! Will come back ...  Thanks Dadda Carl & Carmela","5253":"I loved this B&B .... All was perfect, Large room , very clean and well maintained. I spent to nights and it was great , superb breakfast, I will be back my next visit In Messina . Ideal location close to restaurants and bars , A+","5260":"We stayed at La Casa di Dada in early July 2017 and its a great place to stay. Messina has some interesting places to visit. Casa di Dada close to the centre, car parking is on street but not a problem. Dada was very welcoming and a very nice hostess. The accomodation is excellent and you will see from the photos Dada's unique style and design. Everything is clean, tidy and looks great. The room we had was downstairs but was cool. The room was spacious, well furnished and comfortable. Breakfast on the balcony was continental and again excellent. Only one problem and that was the shower flooding the floor. It was annoying and I hope that Dada has got that fixed now. That said we would stay at Casa di Dada again.","5291":"Town House Messina was a lovely apartment within walking distance to the harbor in Messina. The units we had were very nicely decorated with good showers & felt very safe. There is a long staircase to climb up to the 2nd floor where the apartments are so it might be difficult for someone who is not in shape carrying suitcases up those stairs. We got a very warm reception once we found the place.","5295":"If coming into Messina by train from other parts of Sicily or the mainland of Italy, the railway station is about 10 minutes walk away. Located near a main square and on a shopping street, it is very central.  However, it is not a traditional hotel with proper entrance at street level. In fact I ended up walking round the block only to spot the sign next to the door buzzers. It was basically an entrance into an apartment office block. Fortunately the front door was open, however on reaching what I thought was the entrance the door was closed and no buzzer or knocker. I tried calling, the number on Google was unobtainable. Fortunately my booking.com app had the right details.The proprietor answered, he was out of the building but he left someone else to attend. She came down and dealt with checking me in. No proper desk or anything resembling a proper hotel. Maybe it should just go under the heading of a B&B.  The property owner was good to advise me (by email) of a food festival taking place that day. It was noisy but I accepted that risk. As they were not full, I was offered use of a larger suite on the floor above. To access it was via a steep metal staircase which was poorly lit.  The suite was of a decent size. Overall fairly comfortable though despite looking quite recently decorated, there was a lot of paintwork peeling off especially in the bathroom.  Overall this was a disappointing stay and misleading to call it a proper hotel with the need to access it via buzzers and no proper reception.","5322":"The air conditioning in the room they gave us was broken and they had to give us another room, so they degraded us to a worst one. The butter at breakfast had gone bad and the lounge was super small. On the plus side, the location of the hotel is great, and reception employees were polite.","5326":"This hotel is located at the City Centre and is very close to the main attractions. Room is very clean, comfortable bed and there is some tea and a kettle in the room which is very nice after a long day walk. Staff is very helpful and nice, wonderful breakfast. I highly recommend this hotel. Noemia, a girl at the reception is a very nice person who made us feel very welcome. Staff speak a good English.","5348":"Good clean, efficient, city centre hotel. The rooms and their en suite bathrooms are of a good size. Unfortunately there were major works out on the road which added to city noise wgich included music from nearby until 2300 hours. The reception staf were helpful. We did not get much communication from the waiting staff at breakfast but nothing ran out. The bar is small and slightly minimalist in choice.","5355":"We were thrilled to arrive in Palermo and be driven to Hotel Garibaldi. It immediately felt in a very safe area and was close to great cafes, restaurants, shops. The Hop on Hop off buses were located outside the hotel. The staff were extremely helpful. We were happy with the breakfast. Loved our room - initially we had a nice smaller room but upsized to a big beautiful room with a balcony overlooking the main street. Absolutely no noise as the doors were double glazed. We would recommend this hotel to our friends always.","5357":"Super hotel and extremely helpful staff. The reception staff could not have been more welcoming and helpful. Nice friendly atmosphere. We got a nice upgrade and We had a lovely view and balcony. Food was good unfortunately not many choices but this is typical in Italy. Again very friendly staff each day with smile on the his face waiter organize for me fresh (soft)fried eggs, once again thank you . Perfect location and walking distance from the city centre. Free Wi-Fi. I would like to say a special thanks to Martina from Reception Who was brilliant. We will highly recommend!","5363":"Stayed 3 nights. Hotel entrance is below road level on the side down some stairs. Rooms are large with big bathrooms. They sometimes turn all the air conditioners off at 3am - a money saving initiative I'm sure. Breakfast is served in the windowless below street level sprawling breakfast room. The selection is adequate and topped up regularly. Staff do their job and nothing more, pleasantries have been deemed as unnecessary, like all of Italy. The hotel was adequate to our needs but if you are looking for italian elegance and beauty, look elsewhere.","5370":"The plus: 1. location - close to tbe city centre (10min walk) 2. Parking - if you have a car, convenient parking at the back of the hotel. 3. Staff willing & helpful, both at the reception and at breakfast. 4. Big room.  The bad: 1. Although furnishing in the room seems ok, curtains are torn, walls are dirty and in need of urgent painting and bathroom dirty with some mould. 2. Terrible breakfast!!! Too many sweets, fresh bread consisting of only some small white rolls, no cucumber tomatoes, limited cheese choice which you could find anywhere (not expected in Italy!!). 3. Parking costs an extra of a round \u20ac15 per day!  From the photos it looked better than what we actually faced. In general, just an average hotel where I would not stay a second night!","5383":"We have booked here but we selected the wrong date. We called the hotel and receptionist said they did not return us the money and that they did not have vacant room for the correct date. SCAM, we will contact our lawyer.","5400":"We spent a few days in this hotel. The location was the best thing about it! The room was big and clean but very basic. The view from our window was bad but we didn't really mind since we did not spend much time in the room. A balcony would be nice especially for smokers. Breakfast was nice and the staff very helpful. Check in and out was easy and quick. I will add pictures as soon as possible!","5403":"The hotel itself was on a good location, close to city centre, 20 mins walking to train station and just across the road to the airport bus. Room was spacious and clean, big bathroom, air con was good too. Staff was friendly on reception and check-in was quick.  Downside - despite room was clean, they missed to clean the sink in the bathroom, we checked-in late so didn't bother to call reception to send someone but cleaned it ourself. Wifi is poor, not sure if everywhere in the hotel but in our room was useless.  Strange they keep the passport on check-in, I am not sure it is a good standard practice.  Overall the hotel is good, but some basic things need more attention therefore only 4 star.","5406":"Stayed 4 nights Saturday to Tuesday. First impressions were very good. Checked in by Martina who was excellent. Really helpful, full of advice about where to go and how best to do it, a credit to the hotel.  Room was a decent size and very clean with the maid coming in each day. Have read previous comments about poor air con. Our experience was that it is controlled centrally by reception. We asked for it to be on in our room and it was each evening and all through the night. Think it was turned off at 10am through the day but on again in the evening so no problems, just ask at reception.  Breakfast was fine. Pastries, cereal, yoghurts, continental or Fried eggs and bacon available wih fresh bread rolls. Sometimes had to wait for it to be replenished but the young waiters were hard working and very polite.  Hotel is in a good location opposite Theatro Politeama with a good Gelateria next door with cheap beer also sold right in the square. Hotel is a 5 min walk to main street with Theatro Massimo and all the restaurants.  Would have given a 4 star rating but last impressions on leaving this morning I have dropped to 3. Wanted to take a couple of croissants to eat in reception whilst waiting for our taxi to the airport. An older waiter at breakfast didnt appear very pleased with that idea. Although I couldn't understand him as he was speaking Italian (which is to be expected and right in Sicily) but he was not happy, it was a couple of Croissants!  Also as I checked out I checked our taxi had been booked as requested the evening before and then waited in reception for our driver. 10 minutes late I checked again with reception where our taxi was. The reception pointed to the driver also sat in reception who had been there when I was checking out. Why not tell me that he was there? Laughed about it with taxi driver but agree with other reviews that some of the older staff don't appear to care too much for their guests which is a great shame as the younger staff members were great and are a credit to the hotel.","5409":"We were on a guided trip so had no say in choosing this hotel. Bedroom was tiny, cannot possibly be four star. We saw so many better looking hotels with four star rating. Poor air con, breakfast choice and presentation. There was no coffee in the room (Italy!!) but only fruit tea bags. No hair Conditioner in the bathroom. Very slow WiFi and very hot room. My own face flannel was removed from the bathroom and never seen again!","5419":"Very disappointing hotel. Room was good size but sparsely fitted - one good point - it was very clean. Public rooms are dire - minimal decor, in basement. But worst feature was the attitude of the older staff - total disinterest in their guests.We arrived late in the evening after a lengthy journey and in need of a drink. We were told that the bar had closed at 10pm. When I challenged it the barman shrugged his shoulders and walked off. Fortunately a younger receptionist to her credit supplied us with a beer. Throughout our stay older staff largely ignored us, not speaking and only responding in a minimalist way. No smiling, no helpful suggestions. Absolutely zero. I reported an issue with the aircon which was not working, on the first day, again on day 2 and day 3. No effort was made to sort it out and it was still not working when we left. We ate only breakfast in the hotel. Like the dining room it was minimalist. No fresh fruit, a few small bread rolls. 'Toast' in packets. Coffee from a machine, poor quality fruit juice from a machine. Quite simply awful and the local markets are teeming with fresh produce. It would seem that the hotel management did not have a clue. We found an alternative to the total absence of any comfort, service or friendliness in the bar by going to a small bar at the top of the steps leading to the hotel and I highly recommend the experience to you. Look for my review of Bar Aniston","5426":"I stayed at at the Garibaldi whilst accompanying a group of students on a school trip to Sicily. The hotel location is great - very central and easy to walk to all the main attractions in Palermo. The airport shuttle bus goes from just across the square so transfers are very easy.  The room was serviceable and clean, and a very good size. The hotel bar was inexpensive and the breakfast had enough choice to satisfy everyone.  The main issue I had with the hotel was the EXTREMELY loud noise from the cinema across the alleyway. The noise went on until past 2am every night and was so loud that I could hear all the soundtrack and could identify the films being played each evening! There is the usual amount of chatting and \u2018people\u2019 noise that you\u2019d expect in a city centre, but the cinema noise was over the top and made sleep difficult. I discovered from chatting to them in the bar that a number of other guests shared similar concerns. I would not choose to stay here again for that reason.","5428":"This is a clean, safe, comfortable hotel in an excellent location, and it was good value for money. Our room was spacious, with a safe, small fridge, and tea & coffee making facilities. The beds were comfortable, though the pillows were a little thin for my liking. The bathroom was a good size too, and they get brownie points for having very large bath towels. For some reason, the bath had anti-slip grooves only at the end AWAY from the shower, so in order to be under (or even near) the water flow, you had to stand on the slippery part of the bath.  The hotel is very close to the main shopping street, with an abundance of restaurants and cafes also close by. Very convenient for bus stops as well. The main entrance is located down some shallow gradual steps. We weren't bothered by noise from inside the hotel, and only a little exterior noise when we had the windows open. We couldn't get the AC to work, but we were happy to have the windows open instead. I assume that the AC is switched on in the hotter months. The WiFi is free, though it did dip in and out at times. There is one big bulky key per room, personally I prefer key cards, but perhaps they will update their system at some point.  The breakfast buffet is adequate - not amazing but not terrible either. I thought the coffee from the machine was perfectly fine, and the servers were happy to make fresh coffee if requested. I was disappointed to see two large bowls of tinned fruit available every morning - there was some fresh fruit too, and I would have preferred to see more of that. Perhaps tinned fruit is a local custom.  The hotel overall was very clean, but the room housekeeping was a little hit and miss. They did not wash our cups when we used them, nor did they replenish the tea that we drank. Milk was not supplied but could probably be requested. One day they left a dirty pillowcase on the floor of our room, and when we packed to leave, we found a pair of clean socks in the corner of the wardrobe, left behind by a previous guest.  Despite a couple of small niggles, I felt it was a good hotel, and would use it again if I return to Palermo.","5429":"We booked this hotel as part of a flight and hotel package. The hotel is just off the centre of the historic area of Palermo. You can walk to most of the landmarks from here and if shopping floats your boat then there is plenty of that in the area. If you like coffee and cake then you think you have died and gone to heaven.  The hotel itself is in an old building but is modern inside. I know some people don't like the idea of the reception and the breakfast room being below street level but from our point of view it made no difference. Please note that as far as I could see the only way in from the street and car park was by going down some gradual steps.  Our room was spacious and clean. The AC did not work but the temperatures were not that excessive so we just opened a window. It is an inner city hotel so please do expect some street noise but all the same that could not be heard once the windows had been shut. The beds were a little hard as were the pillows but after walking around all day sleep came easily. The bathroom was also a good size with a small selection of toiletries. Congratulations for having big bath towels and not handkerchief size that some hotels offer.  Within the room was a small mini bar which meant that it gave you a fridge, a safe and free wifi throughout the building. The breakfast as many people have mentioned is a basic buffet offering. I have had better but on the other hand I have had a lot worse. Coffee is dispensed from a machine, but if you did not like that then the staff were more than happy to get you a fresh drink from the kitchen. The fruit juice was a little disappointing seeing that Sicily grows a lot of fresh fruit.  The staff were friendly and helpful and all in all I have stayed in many worse places than this one. This was a good tourist, business inner city hotel with no frills. If you want a gym, swimming pool then this is not for you but if you want a sufficient breakfast in the morning and a good nights sleep then it is fine.","5439":"Had a 4 night stay here. Staff were friendly enough but when we arrived we were obviously tourists and had to ask for a map. Breakfast was a poor show. Lots of cakes and not a lot else. For a nation that love its coffee, the stuff from the machine was shocking! The tea was no better and had a distinct taste of bleach about it! Our room was round the back so was nice and quiet but was quite warm. We asked if the ac could be turned on in our room and were treated to heating instead. Apparently we were in the wrong month for cold ac! I\u2019d question the 4 star rating here. More of a 3.5. Good location though.","5447":"This was rated a four star. Not close....dirty, disgusting, smelled like garbage. The breakfast was substandard and the staff rude. We had 50 people and everyone on our trip was shocked at the accommodations.","5450":"Hotel is located in very kind place, next to theater and spot which can be your start point. Unfortunately, breakfasts were poor - sweet dishes and ham, cheese. No vegetables. Coffee like - espresso, latte, mocha as so on were awful. Nevertheless our bed was quite nice, but the walls were in bad condition.","5456":"We spent six nights in Palermo and were very happy with our stay. The hotel staff are very friendly and helpful, and took good care of us. We were travelling with a baby, and providing us with a crib was no problem at all.  I particularly liked how clean the room was, although I would suggest perhaps adding a shelf or two in the bathroom, which was very spacious and felt a bit empty.  The complimentary breakfast had everything on offer for a great start into the day. I especially liked the selection of pastry and sweets.  Lastly, the hotel's location is quite simply perfect for exploring Palermo on foot.","5471":"Upon our arrival we were welcomed by Giuseppe who showed us our room. The room in itself is rather large and has a separate bathroom across the hall (which is private as there is an additional door which leads to the reception area). Everything about the place is perfect, exceptionally clean and very well thought out. In the room there is a mini-fridge with some basic stuff and in the bathroom showergel and shampoo are also provided.  The breakfast was a wonderful treat every morning with coffee prepared by Giuseppe and croissants, yoghurts and chocolate peach pies readily available. We loved everything about the place and Giuseppe was very helpful! Would definitely visit again.","5530":"Visited there for short stay on a friends trip, we were three of us so they gave us a double and a single bed. I took the single bed and was unable to sleep because mattress was awful, tilted to one side so it felt you could fall. Breakfast was poor quality mostly sweets and cheap white bread. Location was great, cleanliness was very good and staff was awesome,I would say they were the best part of the stay, however since I could not sleep well, I would not recommend staying until they get better mattresses","5534":"This hotel, as it is quite common in the centre of spanish and italien cities, is a rebuild living space designed as a hotel. During your stay, a big, clean, air conditioned room with an own bathroom with shower is provided. The air condition can be controlled individually. The room is cleaned on daily basis including fresh towels. In addition, a fridge, TV and Wifi (pretty slow) were included.\r \r After our arrival, we got a free lunch (rigatoni arrabiata) to our suprise. In the morning, a breakfast is provided (toast with simple sausage, cheese or marmalade, hand-made cake and different styles of coffe).\r \r Even though the people were nice, no one was able to speak fluent english, but this seemed to be quite common during our stay in Sicily.\r \r As everywhere, you have to pay an accomodation tax for your stay.\r \r Overall, within 30 minutes you can reach the train station and the most important sights by feet.","5554":"In Centro is located on the edge of gritty, old Palermo and the new city. Very convenient from the airport bus stop so no need to take a taxi from the airport. The staff was very friendly and helpful but are not there 24 hrs a day. The B&B was remodeled in 2017 so everything worked well, good shower pressure, very spacious room, comfortable bed. We were in Liberte room which is directly on the main street so despite the well insulated windows we could hear the louder street sounds. Nearby are at least a dozen restaurants to choose from. In October 2019 they just started construction of the underground metro on the street in front of In Centro. We were not effected by construction sounds but this may be a problem in the future. Also, street access is a little limiting from construction barricades. Breakfast was the standard Italian breakfast with sweet breads, yogurt, fruit and packaged cheese and meat. Lattes were always good. Definitely would recommend this place.","5561":"Fabulous B&B right next to Teatro Politeama. The shuttle from the airport stops 2 minutes walk away. The Hop-On Hop-Off bus leaves from right outside and the ticket office is also at the entrance. It is walking distance from many eateries as well as many of the attractions. The rooms are very spacious as are the bathrooms (shower only). The rooms are modern, fresh and nicely appointed. The breakfast is fresh and generous. The staff are friendly helpful and polite. Disabled travellers would struggle as the breakfast room is up a right spiral staircase.  We would definitely stay here again!","5564":"We stayed two nights at B&B In Centro based on the previous reviews, location and price. We were not disappointed. They were able to arrange airport transfers for us ahead of time, which was convenient after 19 hours of traveling. The room, Politeama, was spacious and clean. The bathroom, surprisingly so as well. The bed was very comfortable, probably too comfortable haha. The shower was great. We did hear some noise when people were in the breakfast lobby area, but it wasn't terrible. Street noise was quiet. It was very convenient to walk where we wanted from the B&B. The only downside is you only get one key, so if one person wants to leave you can't really leave them because the key turns everything in the room on off and you need it for a suite entrance and then your door. So I felt kind of stuck with just the one key, but this was something we ran into a lot of places so its not a deal breaker. We both said we would stay here again definitely!","5575":"What a lovely and pleasant stay we had! We normally stay in hotels but found most hotels in Sicily appeared to be old, dated and overpriced. So we booked B&B In Centro Palermo.  From the moment we booked, the lovely Federica contacted us with regards to location, parking and checking in details a few months ahead, so if we were not sure of anything, we had opportunities to check.  Our plane arrived in the evening, and Federica kept us informed as soon as we stepped off the plane and ensure our arrival to the B&B and check in all ran smoothly.  The room was modern, contemporary, large in size, and cleaned every day. Bed was comfortable. Breakfast was included each day and we were served by a sweet lady who remembered our tea and coffee orders every day we were there. Normally I don't have high expectations when it comes to options of breakfast in Italy, as most items are too sweet such as biscuits, sweet pastries, but it did offer fruit, yoghurt and cereal, toast and eggs which was more than I expected.  The location was between old town and designer shops area, so most sights, restaurants, shops and bars in Palermo were all within walking distance.  I would highly recommend this place and all the helpful friendly staff as comfortable base in Palermo,","5582":"We really enjoyed our long stay at In Centro. We had our two kids, 5 and 3. The rooms were beautifully decorated, had one queen bed and 2 twin beds for the kids. It\u2019s in a perfect location to shops and eats. A quick 20 mins to Mondello Beach. The staff were all very warm and welcoming. We will definitely come back!","5589":"The location is perfect. You go on foot to most interesting places to visit. They have big and modern rooms, very nicely decorated and offer a great breakfast. Most of all, what made our experience unique was the way Antonio, Silvana and Luciano helped us. We had a big problem because our luggage did not come, it was on weekend, nobody in the airport helped us, but the owners of the B & B personally assumed the control of the situation, and had no limits on effort until everything was solved. Thanks forever to their kindness.","5619":"This B&B has a great location, super close to the downtown area! The sightseeing bus is literally at your doorstep and you can purchase the tickets at directly at the B&B. We stayed in the luxury room that can accommodate up to 6 people. Room didn't have a minifridge. Has a very good continental breakfast! Beware of the winding staircase to get to the breakfast area.","5635":"In Centro is a beautifully appointed b&b. The room we had was very spacious with a comfortable bed, modern in immaculate condition. The design is wonderful and lots of nice touches... Magazines, kettle for tea and coffee, fridge and shutters to ensure a dark room. Bathroom is very well appointed. All the staff has been super friendly and helpful. They arranged for a pick up from the airport, gave us lots of recommendations for our Palermo stay, booked restaurants and held our luggage on the last day. The location is very convenient for visiting all the sites in old Palermo but also the shops in new Palermo. Definitely would stay again!","5744":"Well this is pretty much the type of hotel you get anywhere in the world. However I liked it a lot. Excellent friendly service. Centrally located. The room was a good size and comfortable. My only gripes - the internet was very intermittent and the air conditioning mysteriously went off in my room and I had to call to get it put on. But really i enjoyed my time at this hotel and would go again","5758":"This is a lovely clean hotel with an excellent restaurant. The bar facilities however are poor with no where to sit and enjoy a drink. The restaurant is limited in choice with Pizzas not available at lunchtime. The breakfast is limited but nice and tasty especially the cakes. The savoury items are very limited and the hot drinks come out of a machine.....yuc. The hotel is fine if you have good weather as the pool areas are nice and clean and a good choice of sunbeds. From what I could see it is mainly used for business travellers and people using it as a base for sight seeing. I was a male solo holiday maker just looking to chill in the sun so it suited me. All of the staff are very friendly. I was there at the beginning of June which I would consider as the start of the main season but they were only just setting up some kind of ice cream and cold drink booth in the pool area. My recommendations would therefore be to have a more suitable selection of lunchtime items in the restaurant, an area to sit comfortably with a drink outside and the bar to be more welcoming. All in all a nice place to stay for a few days in the sun?.","5765":"friendly staff but the hotel needs serious renovation! The elevator broke once and then kept making terrible noises. There is no place to unload the car and the parking is a small unpaved area near the hotel. The rooms are clean but old and basic, one door was broken and did non close properly, bathroom old. Pool filters not working.","5766":"Nice, quiet and clean place in the center of Palermo. All must to visit points are easy to reach from there. Highly recommend to consult the stuff of the hotel. They will never betray your wishes and provide you with the exact information that you need. Food in the capital of Sicily is still authentic and it is a great pleasure to try as much as possible of it. Street markets are mandatory to visit. People of Palermo are nice and friendly. Weather is good almost the entire year. I had a great time in Sicily and wish you to have one. ENJOY!","5821":"This hotel is etched into the side of a mountain with a gorgeous view from the balcony of every room.. Our very clean large room had lots of closet space and a spacious modern bathroom. The beautiful pool area overlooks a wonderful view of the city below. Great restaurant as well. Highly recommend Bel 3.","5823":"Although the hotel itself is fine, the location is really poor if you want to spend any time in Palermo itself. A good 35-40 minute drive to the tourist section downtown of Palermo. Although there is a shuttle it only goes at 9:30 am and 11:00 am and returns at 5:00 pm or 8 pm. If you're the only one in it you pay 12 Euros - and the same coming back. That's quite a bit to add daily and really restricts when you can come or go if you don't want to pay for an even more expensive taxi ride back up the mountain. There's also nothing to do up on the mountainside other than look at the very nice view. That got old quickly as I wanted to spend more time in the heart of the city. Can't figure out why anyone would want to stay so far from the city.","5827":"A hotel with a wonderful view, just outside central Palermo. The rooms were very clean and looked like they had been recently renovated. The pool area was big with a jacuzzi, swimming pool and kids pool too - all with fantastic views. The staff were very welcoming and happy to help. Breakfast was distinctly average - both worth compromising on this for a short stay.","5839":"My husband and I decided to fly to Sicily for a romantic get away. We wanted to stay outside of the city of Palermo. This hotel is perfect. It\u2019s about 20 minutes away from the city (plus or minus traffic). It\u2019s situated on top of a quiet mountain. Our room had a great view overlooking the ocean and the city (1st floor). The staff are beyond friendly and accommodating. The room is very clean and the shower has a lot of pressure. You don\u2019t ever have to leave the hotel to eat because the restaurant is absolutely delicious, fresh, and professional. The breakfast is hands down fantastic too. I called in the early morning for Cappuccinos to be delivered to my room and we got it within minutes. We would come back any time!","5841":"One of the best hotels to have an excellent view from the pool on the rooftop. The staff are very friendly and the rooms are big. It is located on the top of a mountain, so definitely you need a car if you are planning to visit the city frequently. The breakfast could be improved a bit, maybe by providing fresh fruits.","5842":"This hotel was very nice we spend one night in our travels perfect for our situation we came to see the Greeks ruins which was all the tours it took only 2 1 2 hours that was definitely worth the layover this hotel has a nice pool and bar rooms were clean we had dinner at this hotel you can eat tonight it is wonderful not expensive unless you have a car I want to go out looking it was a nice meal set outside if you stay for one night only please try this restaurant it will save you a lot of time driving around asking for a nice place and it was not really expensive food was delicious service was outstanding there is a man that works there and he likes to believe he is Frank Sinatra he is in his 80s and he really makes this please even more charming. Only one downside to this whole place you have to wear a bathing cap in the pool man and women cost us to euros Frank Sinatra will give you the cap","5852":"The hotel was a bit far away from the city centre, but they had shuttle bus to the beach and to the city. The view was nice, but the breakfast very very poor, and every day the same. They offer parking, it is 5 Eur  day. The place is safe, and the area is unique. The elevator works very slow.","5871":"We arrived on the 9th August and it was late. I had already reserved a parking space and this was ready for us. We checked in and was given room 110. This is a superior room so all together \u00a3450 for 7 nights were good. The reception man was gorgeous and checked us in well. His looks and charm were also noted :wink:. The room was modern with everything you needed. The bathroom was clean and the view from the balcony was outstanding. Waking up to the sun and setting on the evening was spectacular. We sat on the balcony with prosecco every night.  Staff were attentive and the adult only section of the pool was amazing. Not many families, more couples but there are a lot of sun beds. The hotel is quite far out from Palermo town, they do have a restaurant on sight, not the best but reasonably priced.  I think the superior rooms would benefit from robes and a kettle so that you could make a coffee or cup of tea. We will be returning next year. It is so peaceful and relaxing :sunglasses:","5880":"We loved our stay at the hotel. Francesco was most helpful on check in. He had recommendations for lunch, dinner. He was able to offer directions and assistance when needed. He went above what we expected and was pleasant and helpful. We ate dinner in the restaurant and the food was amazing. The grounds and location are great. Easy access to town. Highly recommend.","5881":"We stayed three nights here and would recommend it for its location, gardens and clean room. We had a garden view room with balcony which was an excellent room to stay in. It\u2019s 20 minutes walk to the Valley of Temples and 20 minutes walk to the old part of the town - if you don\u2019t mind hills! On the first day breakfast was not up to standard as, probably, the early coach tour people had eaten everything. However we spoke to Sabrina on reception who was efficient and helpful. She spoke to the staff and the following days breakfasts were good for us. Francesco was very helpful on our last morning and his English is excellent. The man who booked our room was really helpful on all three days but unfortunately we can\u2019t remember his name. There are restaurants within walking distance if you don\u2019t want to eat in the hotel. Overall we think the hotel is worth staying in, plus the gardens are lovely to sit in. There is a pool also if you want.","5883":"The rooms at The Della Valle are good, it has a lovely garden and swimming pool which for some reason was out of use when we stayed. The food, however, is rubbish. Protein at breakfast was cold and the toaster was useless.","5893":"Unfortunately we spent only one night: we got an upgrade to an amazing and very spacious room with balcony, terrace, nicely furnished, and even a half complementary bottle of wine. Location is very quite (street blocked due to local accident and therefore very few cars driving through). Really thank to Alessia for very warm welcome and dr Anselmi for sharing some insights about Sicily. Leuterpe is absolutely a place to not miss and we\u2019ll 100% come again when back in Agrigento.","5894":"We traveled to Agrigento to visit the Valley of the Temples and spend some a day at the beach, not having given much thought to the city itself. We were pleasantly surprised by the town - very stylish and very welcoming.  Euterpe is the perfect complement to all of that - it is an upscale B&B, carefully and enthusiastically managed by Alessia, who is relentless in making sure that each of her guests are well cared for. Did you particularly like a certain pastry at breakfast on day 1? if so, it could magically appear for you on day 2. Its that level of attention to detail that sets this place apart.  The rooms are modern and well-appointed, and we highly recommend #2, which faces the street (but is very quiet) and has a beautiful terrace to allow you reflect on the day and sip prosecco.  This, however, may not be the best place for guests who cannot walk up two flights of stairs, since there is no elevator. The climb is very well worth the effort if you can do it.","5896":"The Euterpe positions itself as a B&B. A B&B it is, but it has all the qualities of a high-class, upscale hotel. This is high-quality accommodation, but on a small, intimate and personal level. The rooms are well-appointed, with quality furniture and fittings. The bathroom shower room is great; with modern facilities. Everywhere is exceptionally clean and well-maintained. The highlight for us was Alessia, who was most helpful and accommodating, and is a great asset to the hotel.","5897":"Hotel's location is walking distance to the downtown and old city of Palermo. From Falcone-Borsellino airport takes about 30 min to get there with taxi.  Hotel room was big, squeaky clean and nice renovated bathroom.  Dinner was delicious and self-service breakfast was full of choice even if I was a bit late.  The only thing bothering me was the lockdown of the premises at night. And you have to wake up the night security to enter.  All in all it is good hotel and I will be happy to use it again.","5899":"We stayed at the one with biggest terrace and loved our room. Finishes are really nicely done including good shower. They use good quality shampoo and soaps.  There is a restaurant with outdoor seatings and I worried about the noise from there. ( our room window faced there ) But windows are very well installed and I slept very well. ( Bed was also hard and comfortable) We had our breakfast at the terrace. Food quality was also good. Lady at the front desk was very kind.  It was nice that we got complimentary wine and olive oil. I would recommend this place to people.","5903":"Everything about this place is perfect. The host is generous, enthusiastic and welcoming. She even recommended us our personal taxi driver for the evening! The rooms are exceptional with every luxury. The guesthouse is situated midway between old town and the Valley. And then there\u2019s the breakfast - it\u2019s the best we had. One more tip if in town, definitely try to have dinner at Villa Athena - La Terrazza Degli Dei. The food is exceptional and the view over the temples is breathtaking. Couldn\u2019t recommend this place more!","5905":"We had 2 nights at Euterpe.  Firstly, in terms of location, the hotel is a converted grand apartment - think high ceilings, large rooms on Viale della Vittoria a tree lined Main Street that overlooks the valleys of Agrigento. It's a short walk to the centre of town. It's worth noting that parking is street parking with a meter but this wasn't a big issue at all. We had a car and stayed for 2 nights over a weekend (Sunday's are free) but parking rates are pretty cheap. 1 Euro for the first hour and then 50c there after. You don't pay overnight only up to 8.00pm.  The building is set back from the street so outside noise is minimised. We stayed in Room 2 which has the largest balcony to the front and side of the room (the side balcony has table and chairs and loungers). We were given a bottle of local wine and a gift of olive oil from the owners private garden which was a lovely touch.  Styling wise, the room and hotel is very elegant - a restrained mix of traditional furniture pieces set with modern colours and artwork (the framed Herme's scarves were very chic). Bed, linens, bathroom (+toiletries) all very good.  As other reviews have pointed out, the host - Alessia, is fabulous. Welcoming, inviting and knowledgeable.  If breakfast at first glance looks modest, it really is testament to the fact that good, fresh ingredients, locally sourced, thought about and well presented, done well far outweighs hotels that offer long running buffets of not very much. Given the choice I'd rather eat well than consume more.  I'm really pleased we stayed here and would highly recommend a visit.","5922":"Eurterpe is a beautifully designed bed and breakfast a very short walk from the train station in Agrigento and a long walk or short car ride to the archeological ruins. The rooms are beautifully appointed and some have small terraces, the perfect spot for morning coffee or a glass of wine after a day being a tourist. The rates are very reasonable for the luxurious feeling you have while staying there.  The front desk is very helpful and the rooms come with a small complimentary bottle of olive oil, apparently from the owner's olive groves, and a small bottle of red wine. At night, you can take a passeggeiata on the long, main street on which the hotel is located with the other locals and enjoy a spectacular sunset with the ruins and the sea in the distance.  The manager personally arranged a ride for me to Villa Romana del Casa as I had wanted to see it en route to Taormina.  One caveat is that I went a bit off season and was the only guest! There was no one there at night but me and I was a solo traveler. I did not feel unsafe, but when I booked, I did not realize that it was a b & b and not a boutique hotel, and I did not realize I would be totally alone at night and that there would be no one at the front desk. Everything worked out fine, and I did not feel unsafe, but it might not be ideal for some solo travelers.  Overall, I highly recommend Euterpe for a short stay to visit the Valley of the Temples.","5927":"Stayed 3 nights in the Astoria Palace hotel. While the hotel was decent and clean, it was like staying in a monastery. The walls were bare, the lighting bad and the floor was hard tile. The surrounding neighborhood was really dirty, and lacking a choice of restaurants. This hotel was also far from the city center.","5935":"Located within walking distance of centre restaurants and a short drive to the Valley of the Temples. We were greeted by a charming young lady with faultless English for whom nothing was too much trouble. The room came with a beautiful balcony and was extremely comfortable. Restaurants were suggested by the host and did not disappoint. We managed to avoid the tourist traps! We took advantage of the garage for a small extra charge. The only problem we had was finding it - as the sign is v small - but worth the effort in the end.","5936":"This hotel is a gem. The entrance is subtle, just a small sign on a large door in a small building facing a park and the Mediterranean. Upon entering the door, one must climb a flight of stairs up to the hotel. The effort is rewarded. The lobby area is simple and welcoming. The rooms are large and elegant. Ours had a small balcony and faced the park and the sea. The staff is lovely. The breakfast, which included a number of local pastries, was delicious.","5940":"Stayed for two nights in Agrigento. The hotel was located in a nice area and convoy for restaurants and getting to the Valley of the Temples. The girl who runs the place and looks after you is excellent with a wealth of knowledge and great attention to service and her guests. The bed was great and the room modern with nice toiletries and great shower.","5947":"Only had one night on our tour at this hotel but have to say even though the room was on the small size (I\u2019m a single traveler) it was very well cleaned . Bathroom well appointed. Breakfast was as good as I have had anywhere in Italy :it:. As I\u2019m a walker it was in a good area to go for a walk . Was very disappointed with the lack of service at the main bar on the ground floor ,Both men in the bar seemed not to care about providing service even if you could get their attention . In fact 5 of us walked out of the bar when we asked for our drink order to be taken ... ( his reply was I\u2019m busy and when I\u2019m able to take your order I will come over ) it was the way he told us . So we all got up and left for a bar nearby( also much cheaper than hotel ) The bar waiters let the hotel down and cost the hotel as the five of us had drinks and dinner outside of hotel, Maybe the management should look at this problem ... that is happening in the bar . Don\u2019t like being negative But !!!!!!!","5955":"We stayed in the hotel on our last night before travelling home, we found this on booking.com because we has decided to stay an extra night and our Air BNB couldn't cater for an additional night.  We got a good deal on the room and found it to be absolutely fine, an added bonus was the rooftop terrace on the 12th and 14th floors - if a little pricey.  Breakfast was included in the price which offered a wide selection - enough to cater for everyone.  Location wise this was spot on for us, just off the main road which meant easy travelling for the next day.  Parking could be a slight issue, as with anywhere in Palermo just outside the main gates there was an unofficial man who would request money off you for parking on the street - better to pay a few euros than to risk the car being damaged. Something you learn to become accustomed to.  Thanks for a pleasant stay.","5958":"Booked a room with a balcony - oops, there is none available and it doesn't say that I get a balcony - it just says SOME rooms have balconies. Argue with me that I did not send the parking form, that I had . . . rooms are tiny. A C doesn't work. From the minute we walked into this hotel we were treated with disdain. Not sure if they just don't like Americans or if it was us. We are always polite, so when poorly from the start, it was ridiculous. The first fellow was a total jerk. The lady later answered my questions as to the lack of balcony and the beds just shrugged. I am a business owner and would have fired the staff if they worked for me. The ONLY polite person we dealt with the whole time was the bar tender at the 12th floor bar. He is friendly and nice!","5965":"We had a nice stay but there were some caveats. We arrived later in the day and after checking in, the host left. Unfortunately that was before i realized that there was only one bath towel in the bathroom and the bidet was leaking. I understand that there isn't 24 7 desk attendant at a B & B so that is something you need to get used to, but it was a little frustrating. The best part was the location as it was right in the center of the old section of Agrigento.","5975":"Booked this hotel via Booking.com a few months back but due to changing work commitments I had to cancel, I did this with over 2 months to go before my check in date. Appreciate the policy was no cancellation but would have happily negotiated a stay at another time, as I tried to give as much notice as possible.  Contacted the hotel heard nothing, had to ask Booking.com to contact them. They replied saying they will not give a refund, so my money was taken and I\u2019m sure the room was rebooked given the ample notice I gave. Just be warned, their customer service is not good.","5989":"A beautiful little b&b with our room overlooking the courtyard. Nice greeting which included a snack and a refreshment. Parking nearby included. Good light breakfast. Staff pleasant but limited English spoken.","6001":"We were booked to stay 3 nights here. However on the second night the B&B had some mechanical problem in the roof above our room. The result was a constant very loud buzzing noise that lasted all night. As a result we got no sleep! We tried to contacting the owners but to no success.  The next morning the owners had workmen in the roof trying to fix the problem.  However there was no apology for the sleepless night, and to make matters worse we were charged for the sleepless night!  Problems can happen in B&B\u2019s but it\u2019s how the owners respond to a problem that defines good from bad. In the case the response was terrible.","6007":"Palermo is a big place so it can be hard knowing what is central and what's not but this hotel did the job. The first night we had a dinner on the roof restaurant , food was ok but spoilt by incompetent waiting staff messing up the bills Another night in the main restaurant the food was great , fantastic selection likewise with breakfast. Very helpful front counter staff and a nice bar area Outside the hotel the main road was the local rubbish tip , rubbish in bins and loose on the ground as far as the eye can see but that's seems to be Italy these days","6018":"The hotel is very old and needs renovation. The people who are working there need absolutly courses in customer service and above all they have to be more welcoming Too old that everything will seem that it's coming from the 1970. Aboslutly not 4 star. Not even 3. Maybe it used to be that in the past. By inchecking we were given the key to a room where someone else was sleeping in","6019":"Really lovely bed and breakfast at the end of the main shopping eating bars street in Agrigento so a very good position. Free or cheap local parking easily accessible too which is a bonus. Lovely staff, good value, good breakfast, would recommend. We hanged rooms because the first room was small (so avoid Room 2 if possible). Room 3 was much better and away from the noise at the front of the hotel.","6022":"Good hotel to stay a couple of days in Palermo, bit old dated but very good price, the parking is very limited better to pay an extra to use their, btw, don't dare to drive in Palermo probably you would be killed the first day... Good breakfast, nice hall, beautiful terrace...","6025":"Free parking available, but there are limited spaces. Have a nice breakfast. A bit far from the main attractions (historic center), but you can get there by taxi. A few restaurants and cafes nearby as well as a supermarket. A little old, could be renovated.","6026":"A clean stylish b&b that looks on the surface more like an up market hotel. Great effort has gone into the styling but sometimes at the expense of practicalities. e.g. a bed in the middle of the room looks good but where do you put your glasses when you go to sleep? How do you switch off the light without getting out of bed again? The welcome drinks and cake were an unexpwcted surprise and it was lovely to sit on the balcony watching the world go by and sipping sparkling wine. The downside of a front facing room was the noise level which led to a very disturbed night.  Pretty underwhelmed by the breakfast compared with others we have experienced in Sicily - no fresh fruit and unless you have a very sweet tooth very little else to choose from.","6037":"The Palazzo del Teatro is a peaceful and stylishly appointed B&B in a good location in Agrigento. It sits on a pretty square (as one previous reviewer has observed, the only pretty square in Agrigento!) and is at the end of a long-ish street with plenty of restaurants, cafes and bars. We were not short of dining options for our three nights there. The staff were very accommodating although their English was limited, but with our limited Italian we managed to make it work. They parked and retrieved the car upon request and without delay. The breakfasts were lovely, as we have found throughout Sicily. Our days were spent driving out to beach locations at Porto Empodocle and Sciacca and a half day exploring the Valley of the Temples so we were generally satisfied with our time in Agrigento. The big downside for us was the disgusting household garbage which appears to just get dumped on the roadside. It is everywhere (fortunately not in the tourist centre of town where the B&B is located) and is a real blight on urban Sicily.","6039":"This hidden gem is located close to the local government building and near the main street - via Atena. The hotel is very new looking with all the modern facilities that we want. The rooms are sleek and clean. This is our first time to Agrigento and we were not disappointed. The valley of the temples was great. But it was the staff of this B&B that make this extra special. Katya is such a delight that we will recommend this place to all. She was so helpful with her suggestions and calming disposition. We will definitely be back!","6041":"My husband and I recently spent a week in this beautifully appointed and elegant B&B. We could not have been happier with our accommodation. The premises is housed in an old building, located in a pretty square, next to the Luigi Pirandello Municipal Theater Hall and a beautiful church. It is perfectly located for exploring Agrigento, being within easy walking distance of the many shops, bus and train stations, museums, churches and the St. Gerland cathedral. Car parking in the local car park is provided free of charge by the B&B.  From the moment we checked in, we were treated to amazing and attentive hospitality. We were made welcome with drinks and cakes, were given a restaurant recommendation for dinner and a \u201cyou on tour\u201d booklet, which provided for us a comprehensive guide to the city of Agrigento. Our room was lovely - spacious and spotlessly clean - with a comfortable bed and modern en suite bathroom which contained everything that we could possibly need for our stay.  The breakfasts were extremely substantial, with an extensive variety of foods ranging from fruit, yogurts and various savoury items to a mouth watering selection of croissants, sweet treats and many Sicilian delicacies, which the hostesses encouraged us to sample. We did not refuse! On observing that we liked our coffee well diluted with hot water, the hostesses at breakfast provided it exactly how we liked it. Nothing was too much trouble for them.  Throughout our stay, the service we received in this B&B was top notch, and always delivered with a smile. There were many occasions during the week when staff went over and above what one would expect, in order to ensure our comfort and convenience. Every assistance was given to us to ensure a wonderful experience in Agrigento and its surrounding areas. The weather was perfect for enjoying the beautiful scenery and golden beaches and Marie Rosa was generous with recommendations for best and most beautiful places to swim, such as San Leone and Siculiana Marina Beach resort. The water was at all times clean and refreshing.  Thank you Linda, Katye, Marie Rosa, Daniele and all at Palazzo del Teatro for an unforgettable stay in Agrigento.","6045":"Fantastic find, lovely B&B in a perfect location, our rooms were spotless, lovely decor, comfortable bed. The staff were warm and friendly. Huge breakfast. An amazing location close to all the sights but in a quiet lane off the Main Street. Lots of good restaurants close by. Highly recommend.","6048":"We booked the hotel by telephone in the morning with our details and the lady took the reservation but in the evening on arrival there were nobody who open the maingate. We waited 15m at door and try to call severals times and at the end they answered to our call and told us there there is no rooms for us. We spent lot of time to find another Hotel with big bag in the evining. We are quite dissapointed for the hotel.","6051":"The room was a good size - it was clean and had a very comfy bed. The staff were very nice \u2013 they didn\u2019t speak much English but were still extremely helpful, pleasant and made me feel right at home. The location is great, very close to parking and the main street (via Atenea). The parking is free and secure. The breakfast was extensive and really good.","6063":"The B& B is situated in a lovely square in an old house and retains many original features such as old furniture and chandeliers so has a very individual character. The bathroom however was perfectly modern. The staff are very attentive. You are welcomed with drinks and snacks and advice about things to visit. We took up the restaurant recommendation of the manager and were not disappointed. Just around the corner from the B&B the Ruga Reali was very good. You will need a good appetite to fully appreciate the breakfast, which is extensive, with the staff keen for you to sample the specialities of the region. The attentiveness of the staff would not be out of a place at a much more expensive hotel so the value for money was excellent. The location was at the end of the main tourist street, but still within walking distance of the train and bus stations.","6065":"From the moment you enter the door you receive a friendly welcome from the owners with juice & Sicilian treats. The hotel is situated in a very pretty palazzo in a quiet part if the old town. We had a car & parking was arranged close by. The rooms & bathrooms are beautifully decorated. A generous breakfast was served with juices, coffee & Sicilian pastries both sweet & savoury, all delicious. Highly recommend","6066":"Very friendly owner. Possibility of loading and unloading the luggage in close proximity of the B&B. Very supportive staff for explaining how to reach the underground parking garage. Breakfast above Italian average. Everything (except for the Temple District) reachable by foot.","6069":"A charming hotel in the heart of Agrigento. The staff members were quite warm and very helpful with directions. Parking is paid for by the B&B at a nearby underground lot.The room was very well appointed, though there were a bit too many knickknacks for my taste. The breakfast was very good. Each room has a reserved table in the dining area, and the hostess attends to each table personally. The aim of this establishment is definitely to please, and they do not take their clients for granted.","6071":"The Good: The staff at the B&B are second to none. They treat their guests as if you are in a 5-star hotel. The location is excellent for exploring the old part of the city, but if you are driving to the hotel it can be a bit of a challenge from the narrow streets in the old city center. Parking in a lot just around the corner was provided free of charge. Welcome drinks, fruit, and some cakes were provided on our arrival, which was very nice touch, and our luggage was carried up the stairs and to our room by the staff. The location is excellent, in a main square right next to the theater and a church, and the B&B gave a great recommendation for dinner at a nearby restaurant. Breakfast was simple but there were many choices available. Coffee is provided from a small machine, which was not very good.  The Bad: The B&B is located in one of the main squares so it was noisy at night due to the traffic. The streets are narrow and, depending on the time of day, can be filled with parked cars making it difficult to navigate to the B&B. I parked illegally on the street right outside of the hotel, which is fine for a short period, to check in and drop off our luggage. Our room was on the top floor and was one of the largest, but it was still small and located right next to the breakfast area. But considering the price, location, and excellent service, I would definitely recommend this B&B.","6098":"We had a fabulous one-night stay at Enzo's Villa Concordia. I wish we could have stayed longer to enjoy the fabulous garden! This site is quiet, gated (and secure safe), convenient (minutes from the Valley of the Temple by car and a short walk to Granofino Restaurant). The room was comfortable (a large bed for us and two twin beds for our teens, all in one big room, plus a large, modern bathroom). There was a mini-fridge stocked with beverages (for a charge), a delightful patio overlooking the garden, a small but refreshing above-ground pool, surrounded by lemon, flowering, and olive trees. Breakfast was great -- Enzo had everything out we could have wanted. Our only mix-up was that when we returned to get our luggage after a sight-seeing tour, we forgot to return our key, so we had to mail it back. Villa Concordia is a wonderful and relaxing oasis!","6101":"I found this quaint B & B by chance on Trivago and chose it because of its proximity to the archaeological park and its price. I stayed for 2 nights. The room was perfect and would have slept 4 people.The bed I chose was comfortable, the bathroom was immaculate and beautiful. Outside I had a private lounge area as well. Enzo was the perfect host, the breakfasts were outstanding for their selection, freshness and overall quality. This is the perfect place to stay for your visit to Agrigento. Eat nearby at Granofino ;-)","6115":"The Villa Concordia is a short drive (3-4 miles) from the top entrance to the Temples site, and just a bit further to the lower entrance. We opted for the upper entrance, but most tour buses drop their people their and then pick them up at the lower, so in the morning the upper entrance can get rather busy. The bottle neck is the ticket booth, which only had one attendant when we arrived and finally acquired a second one, and also the security check, so we spent 45-minutes just getting in. It might be less crowded to enter at the bottom, though the route might not be as picturesque (the steepness of the route didn\u2019t seem to be an issue).  My wife and I stayed at the Villa Concordia for 3 nights in late September, \u201817 and used it as a base for exploring both the Valley of the Temples and other sights in the area. It worked well for this. The hotel is located in the little town of Mose, which has some restaurants and a supermarket but that\u2019s about all. The Villa is set back from the main road down a short lane, and has gated private parking adjacent to attractive gardens.  The building is nicely designed to reflect the spirit of the locale, with 4-5 rooms arranged in different parts of a common bulding, each room having its own outside entrance. There is a small above ground swimming pool and a small building that housed the breakfast area. Both were just a short walk from the main building through the garden. Our room (the Athena) was good-sized, brightly decorated in a modern style. It had a comfortable double bed, two night stands, an armoire, mini-bar, small coffee table, desk, and two side chairs. Wifi was strong and fast, and the a.c. was quiet and effective. The bathroom was also good-sized, with a shower, toilet & bidet, a pedestal sink, and a small cabinet for storage.  The room did have a couple of relatively minor maintenance issues \u2013 the light bulb in one of the night stand lamps was broken, and the light over the bathroom sink wasn\u2019t working. The night stand lamp was fixed quickly after we reported it, but the bathroom lighting problem probably required an electrician.  The included breakfast was barely adequate and not very good. There was just a little fresh fruit and a very limited selection of other items. If there is one aspect that could be improved at the Villa, this is it.  The resident manager was efficient, friendly, and helpful. Overall we enjoyed our stay here, and certainly recommend it, though if we returned we might look more closely at places in Agrigento that would still be convenient to the Temples yet have more to offer in the immediate vicinity.","6120":"We spent two days in Agrigento at this beautiful little Bed and Breakfast.  The room was large, clean and the air condition nice and cold. They have a small above ground swimming pool which was very nice. The garden is beautifully kept and there is good parking inside the B&B.  There are nice restaurants in the area and it is a short drive both to the Beaches at San Leon and a few kilometers to The Valley of Temples, where the B&B gets it's name.","6153":"This modest hotel is centally located and very good value. Our room, despite facing the road at ground floor level, was quiet and spacious. Everything worked (except the safe), and it was a bit difficult to stop flooding the bathroom from the shower.  Those relatively minor issues apart, bed was comfortable, kettle for tea and coffee, aircon, (we slept very well), excellent wifi, plenty of electric points (lighting a bit dim), good shower, large thick towels, plenty of warm water.  Breakfast fine, but some things ran out and wern't replaced although there was plenty of choice. Very sweet otange juice OK when diluted with water. Good toaster, but takes ages!  Evening cocktail bar a must - good value before going out for dinner, especially since penty of nibbles included.(Payment in cash even if put on the bill.) Hotel staff all very friendly , helpful and efficient. Good local eating recommendations. Taxi from hotel to railway station in light traffic was a rip off at \u20ac20. We happened upon a freelance local driver who took us to to Greek temple site at Selinunte - a whole day for \u20ac135 - excellent experience. If you want a central hotel which is modestly priced and ticks almost all the boxes this one is great: warmly recommended","6165":"We loved staying at the hotel. All amenities were taken care of, great breakfast and location was fantastic! Staff were very helpful and friendly. We are a family of four, two adults and two children - 8 years old and 5 years old.","6166":"Totally new (rooms and bathrooms like from your house). The owner (Ottavio) is a gentleman, ready to give tips and makes available the 24 hour kitchen to the guests, plus breakfast option in a nearby place (not needed so much!). Free parking on the street, but this is so in almost every B & B.","6195":"This is a wonderful BnB in Palermo! They accommodated our late arrival around midnight, and also held our bags for a later departure. The hotel was very clean and the breakfast was delicious! We had the room with the private external bathroom, and the bathroom was perfect. Clean, great shower, hair dryer, etc. Very comfortable bed. Great value for money and central location.","6212":"This B&B is a gem. It's new and the owner is working hard to please. And indeed, we felt very well taken care of! Loved the location and ability to walk in town.  Be aware that is you arrive by car, the parking is a challenge. Not insurmountable because of the great efforts of the owner to help and accommodate. The owner coordinated our arrival time and came out and drove our car to a nearby parking space on the street. He and his son and girlfriend carried our luggage in and were patient to answer may questions about the area. Parking was not an issue for the rest of the weekend, I think it helped that it was the weekend. But we are used to parking issues in Boston.  The accommodations were comfortable, simple, clean, with a nice bathroom, and large space. A cute little balcony off our rooms. We were 4 women and felt very safe. We were glad to be in the old town and close to the temples. Walking around the old town of Agrigento was interesting. They usually give a pass to the local caf\u00e9 for coffee and pastry. The first AM we were looking for a big breakfast, early, prior to our tour of the temples. Octavio accommodated our request and came with eggs, pastry, cereal, fruit, yogurt and we ate at small tables in their kitchen.  Octavio is a wonderful man who goes out of his way to please his guests. Their fridge is always stocked with free water, oranges, and yogurt. Also, a coffee maker available. Very sweet.  I highly recommend this B&B. You will be glad you chose it!","6224":"Front desk people very accommodating. Breakfast great. Location great. Priced just right. Absolutely no complaints. What more could you ask for? They say I have to write at least 200 words:) So I say keep it simple and stay here!","6226":"We stayed in one of the basic rooms on the 3rd floor for three nights. The room was simple but okay, with a few things to maintain since they were a bit outdated or a little broken. No coffee teamaking facilities in our room, but we had a small fridge, a really small tv and a nice balcony overlooking a quiet courtyard. The personnel was extremely friendly and helpful at the reception desk. The room was cleaned daily just impeccably. Very friendly staff at the restaurant. We had a good breakfast, which was included in the price. The location of the hotel is just perfect: walking distance from everything, close to sights and airport bus. 20 minutes walk from Palermo Central station. Overall, we had a very nice stay and would gladly return to this hotel.","6228":"Perfekte Lage in ruhiger Gegend der Altstadt. Neu renovierte, modern & geschmackvoll m\u00f6blierte Wohnung mit 3 Doppelzimmern mit B\u00e4dern, K\u00fcche und Fr\u00fchst\u00fccks Esszimmer im 1.Stock eines Mietshauses, Supermarkt und mehrere Restaurants in unmittelbarer N\u00e4he (trotzdem kaum L\u00e4rm), alle Hauptattraktionen Palermos und der Hafen in Laufweite. 5 min zur Via Roma & Quattro Canti. Blitzsauber! Angela - die Mama des Besitzers - machte ihrem Namen alle Ehre und erwies sich als wahrer Engel, sie kam allmorgentlich und bereitete uns ein f\u00fcrstliches Fr\u00fchst\u00fcck das keine W\u00fcnsche offen lie\u00df und niemals aufzuessen war. Toast, s\u00fc\u00dfe Teilchen, Kuchen, Prosciutto, Mortadella, Obst, Joghurt, Cerealien, Marmelade, Honig, Peanutbutter und dazu wechselnd warme K\u00f6stlichkeiten wie R\u00fchrei, Omelette, Focaccia, und weitere sizilianische kulinarische S\u00fcnden. Wir haben eine wundersch\u00f6ne Woche dort verbracht.\r Perfectly situated in a quiet area of the old town. Newly renovated, modern & tasteful furnitured apartment with 3 double rooms with bathroom, kitchen & breakfast dining room, 2nd floor of an apartment building. A supermarket & several restaurants in immediate neighborhood (tip: Al Covo dei Beati Paoli) - but causing little noise. A tourist info right at Piazza Marina, bus stop of the free oldtown bus line located one intersection east (Via Vittorio Emanuele), all of Palermo's major attractions easily reached by foot. Ca. 5 min walk to Via Roma & Quatro Canti. The apartment spic & span! Breakfast extraordinaire! Angela - the owner's mama - came every morning and dished up a magnificent breakfast featuring everything you might desire: Toast, pastries, cannoli, cake, tramezzini, prosciutto & mortadella, scamorza & cacciocavallo, fruit, yoghurt, cereals, marmelades, honey, peanutbutter, eggs and warm Sicilian delicacies. We spent a wonderful week there.","6233":"It's OK but not very good value at 100 euros a night at the end of September. Room was a good size but very old fashioned although with a modern bathroom. Two man (old) lift with steps up to it and steps down to breakfast room. Average breakfast with the weird undrinkable gloop for juice. Reception staff very good but others indifferent.","6238":"This apartament is in good area just next to Carrefour and nice park, in walking distance from via Roma and Stazione Centale. Very helpful staff, tasty breakfast, rooms with soul. In apartament you will find fully equiped kitchen. I definitely reccomend.","6243":"This hotel is ideally located so that all of Palermo's attractions can be visited on foot. The room was comfortable with the added bonus of a small balcony which we hadn't been expecting. The bathroom was small but everything worked well. Reception staff were very pleasant and helpful. The breakfast was excellent, as is typical of buffet style breakfasts around the Mediterranean. The traffic outside was noisy. We enjoyed our stay very much.","6245":"The hotel is perfectly located in Palermo city center, minutes walking from all main attractions. Clean and new rooms with good breakfast included. Parking is available in the building. The perfect base for you trip in Palermo","6257":"Excellently located, within easy walking distance of all the main attractions in central Palermo. Very good breakfast. Friendly staff. Rooms are very basic but clean, and the bathrooms are good if a little on the small side.  Try to get a room facing away from the road (Stabile) as it is noisy all the time.  We had 3 rooms all varying in size from large (executive or premium), through small (standard), to tiny (single). Tea and coffee making facilities in the double rooms but no milk.  We stayed for 4 days and it was a great break in what is a wonderful city.","6261":"The hotel is very well located, close to everything!  Breakfast is amazing and homemade, you can choose among a large variety of salty and savoury products! Croissants, cakes, eggs, bacon, sausages, ham, cheese and a lot more...  The staff is very friendly and at your disposal, always kind and professional.  I will come back","6266":"Location excellent, staff helpful, parking available, room large and spacious, lovely buffet breakfast.Really can't fault the Hotel at all and I would definitely recommend it, we were there 2 nights.","6269":"Checked out on the 23RD August. Had a fantastic 7days stay. We stayed in an executive room with balcony facing into side road. We had a great super long size bed and also a spare single bed which we used to place our clothing and cases on. The room was air conditioned and with the balcony doors open was very airy. The breakfast was good and comprised of hot scrambled egg, cooked panceeta and bizarrely hot dogs. They was fresher made bread Danish and fruit tarts.The waiting staff very pleasant and helpful. The hotel is Located just off via Roma, which leads straight to Palermo central staion. There's lots of restaurants within walking distance and the Massimo theatre is about a 5 minute walk. This is where most people gather early evening and is home again to bars and eateries. The reception staff were also very helpful Gianfranco helped us book a day trip to mount etna. All in all if visiting Palermo you could not book a more genuine, clean and traditional hotel to stay. Our room, on returning each day was immaculate, clean and fresh. All staff are a credit to the owners. Thank you for a lovely time","6273":"When ee first arrived the hotel, it eas difficuld to stop the car in front of the hotel. There is no parking soace available. You have to hurry up to carry the luggages to the hotel. After that a nice man comes and takes your car to a safe garrage for 14 Euro per day. The building is historikal building. Rooms are big and clean. Breakfast is very good. Nice lady in reception is very kindly and helpfull. This is the right choise to stay Palermo.","6275":"It was very nice experience and we had a great time. Hotel room was clean, staff were friendly and helpful .very close to most if attraction and defintly recommended .also breakfast bar was nice and pleasant","6276":"We stayed at this B&B for three nights and were given a very warm welcome on our arrival, including a cold drink and Sicilian snack. All the staff we encountered were very friendly and helpful; nothing was too much trouble. Our room was spacious, clean and with a very comfortable bed; a good breakfast was also provided. The B&B is not on the ground floor but there is a lift. The apartment is centrally located, close to both the train station and the bus station and to restaurants. If returning to Agrigento, we would choose to stay at this B&B again.","6277":"We (2 adults and 2 children) stayed in Hotel Tonic for four nights in early August and for the price we got it at, it is great value. The rooms are in good condition, the breakfast, although simple, is good and the location is very central.","6285":"Here\u2019s a hidden gem! We had a wonderful stay in a great location here. Our room was just as pictured and was very clean and located in a great area with lots of restaurants and sites to see, the breakfast was really good too. This was by far the best value for the money in years and we travel all the time!! Thanks for a great stay!","6313":"Apart from the eexcellente position, located directly on the sea, the hotel is in urgent need of a major renovation. To be honest the hotel is clean and tidy but nonetheless oldish and not so well maintained. Breakfast and dining are not up to italian and sicilian standards. Personnel is very kind, gentle and efficient, but the lack of selection at breakfast   dinner or the lack of maintainance cannot be mended with kindness.","6314":"About 5 minutes walk from main train station. Elevator, modern and clean room and bath. Got room we requested. Deposited our luggage since we arrived early. Tip: inform owner estimated arrival. Room good size comfy bed just right with balcony facing temple bath modern very clean dining area modern comfy pastries laid out so we helped ourselves during the day and night. Near bus that will go to the valley but we walked to and took the bus back. Rather long walk. Excellent reasonable restaurant just outside but also many resto around. Lovely stay very good value.","6316":"This is an easy review: great location, friendly staff, great breakfast. Parking is available on the piazza right in front of the B&B. There is a nice jazz bar at the corner. The B&B is located on the 4 floor, so you have a great view of the value dei templi.","6322":"We spent our last vacation day close to the Palermo Airport, just 20 min. away. After a busy day visiting Segesta and Castellamare del Golfo we enjoyed the calm atmosphere at the pool and even more a great swim in the warm sea (27\u00b0C) easily accessible with a staircase.  The dinner di take place on the open terrace facing the Mondello Bay by a great full moon evening. Unfortunately, even mid-September this big hotel needs to fill their rooms with Coaches, the service was struggling to keep everybody satisfied, regular guests (not many) and two full groups (quite noisy).  From the hotel to the center of Mondello beach are just 10 min. walk. We were surprised not to see many shops at the beach.","6324":"There is a great variaation of rooms. Our first one had a sickening smell of chemicals and had a view I would not pay for (see the picture).  The second one was a bit better breathingwise, but we woke up every morning at 6:15 to the breakfast kitchen mayhem above us. Like our friends in other rooms, we started to sniff and cough more and more during our stay. Our groups judgement was that there is a serious indoor air problem. Too breathtaking for us.  The location is great, especially the view from the top floor breakfast restaurant is great. If You can locate a cleaned seat and a plate to collect the food, you will like it.","6333":"The hotel was perched on a cliff overlooking the mondello waters which was extremely beautiful. The hotel is very busy. We enjoyed the hotel and location but it does need a few renovations to the decor, rooms and rugs which look a little run down. But all in all it was a good runner up to a last minute closing at the Sofitel in Palermo for renovations.","6346":"Everything about this B&B has been well thought thought out and executed. Recently refurbished to a high standard, the rooms and breakfast area were spotlessly clean. A set check in service was available meaning we could arrive at any time and the owner sent us all of the details in good time. Although the approach by car suggests you may be in a newer area of Agrigento, it is actually positioned on the edge of the old town and only a few minutes walk to the centre with a wide range of bars, restaurants and gelaterias. It is also a good location for visiting the Valley of the Temples - only a few minutes drive away. Breakfast was excellent with a good range of savoury and sweet pastries, fruit etc. The hosts were very pleasant and attentive. Our only disappointment is that we had only booked to stay one night. Thank you for a lovely stay.","6350":"This hotel looks dated but it was fine for our 2 night stay. The grounds (pool outdoor areas) are very clean and well maintained, as are the rooms, however the hallways and common areas are beat up and showing their age. The breakfast room doesn't have air conditioning which made breakfast time miserable. Staff is very kind and helpful and the views from our ocean view room were drop dead gorgeous. If you're looking for a decent place for a short stay I would recommend this, but for longer stays or 4 stars I would go elsewhere.","6352":"I few weeks ago I wrote a great review about this hotel only to feel the need to withdraw it and write a more appropriate message for anyone staying at this disgraceful hotel.. I have emailed them three time to inform them that they double charged me for an upgrade but three weeks later nothing .. So unfortunately I had to get American Express involved and they are now disputing the charges. The reason I\u2019m writing this is to let the public know that this was all a set up from the beginning. They gave us a room with no T.V. and no air conditioning so we went and told the front desk of this unfortunate situation, they quickly sent and assist to verify our concerns and he agreed so they placed us in a room adjacent to our original room and there was a brutal smell of smoke in which I turn to the assistant and asked him what is that god awful smell and he said oh it\u2019s just the wood which was complete BS, when my wife arrived into the room she said absolutely not so again we went downstairs and this time asked for an upgrade because I was frustrated they quickly gave us a selection of five rooms in which we automatically chose the first room because we don\u2019t want to be those annoying guess, went downstairs signed off \u20ac45 extra per night only to find out now that I have been double booked double charged for the entire stay.. I had a sense of a scam from the the start but didn\u2019t really care because the room the upgraded us was stunning but again beware of the scam !! Very sad because we loved every minute of this hotel until we got home and are still in dispute..","6357":"We have just returned from a week long stay at this hotel and it is fabulous. The location is perfect, just a 5 minute walk to the bars and restaurants of Mondello and a 20 minute bus ride (costing 1.40 Euros each way) to Palermo. The hotel has 3 pools that are also open to the locals but they tend to use 2 of the pools that are round the corner from the hotel. The one next to the hotel that the hotel residents use always had plenty of sun loungers and pool towels. The view from the hotel pool area over the harbour and beach is amazing. The room was on the small size but had everything we wanted (and we didn't spend that much time in the room) and we had no balcony (but we paid for the cheapest room option). Do NOT be put off by any negative reviews of this hotel.","6360":"Lovely, newly decorated, clean rooms within a fairly short walk of the main square in Historic Agrigento - which is much much nicer than the views of the town from afar might suggest! Toto was fantastic. Helpful and genuinely friendly he is a really committed advocate for the region. A nice breakfast and parking at the end of the path. A great night after the Valley of the Temples.","6362":"We had 3 days at Donna Teresa & found it extremely comfortable & enjoyed their excellent continental breakfast. Toto & Viviane were most welcoming & were very helpful. All the major attractions to Agrigento are very accessible and it is a short walk up into the town for refreshments. Would have no hesitation in recommending this 4 roomed B& B.","6364":"The facility is new, the hosts are friendly and super welcoming and the overall service was good. Besides the above, here is what else I really liked: - I arrived late at night: the host sent me instructions on how to enter the building and my room via Whatsapp. I really value 24hr check-in when I am road-tripping! - Street parking was easy, free and plentiful. - The facility is located on a large street: that's good for people who get stressed when navigating narrow streets, like there are many in Sicilian small towns. - Both the town centre and the valley of Temples are easily accessible, on foot and by car, respectively.  Tip: go at night to see the temples, if you can! Otherwise go early in the morning to avoid the bus loads of obnoxious tourists with selfie sticks!  P.S. Buona fortuna ai proprietari, Viviana e marito! In bocca al lupo a voi!","6365":"We had an perfect stay at hotel la Torre! The staf is very friendly en The views are amazing. The hotel is A little bit dated but never The less very nice and clean. We had breakfast and lunch and both were very good!","6368":"structure located in the center, treated in detail. Exceptionally clean room. Owner really available. Experience to be repeated. Thanks for everything. See you soon! I highly recommend it.................Grazie e ciao!!!!!","6372":"Booked last minute flights to Palermo and picked Hotel La Torre at random and what a good pick it was! Clean, friendly staff, great air con, fab pool with amazing private access to the sea, short walking distance to nearby restaurants... Would definitely recommend!","6373":"Four days spent in a pretty and obviously newly decorated room with sea views and able to look over Mondello. The room smelt so fresh and lovely and was gorgeously bright. Don't be put off by the rather bland exterior. All the hotel staff, reception, bar, waiters, housekeepers were friendly, helpful and courteous. Breakfasts good and plentiful although a lack of fresh fruit and more interesting meats was disappointing. Evening meals were good and well served, the verandah restaurant has great views as does the outdoor bar area. Only point - corridors could do with a bit of a bit of updating, rather gloomy. Would definately book into this hotel again.","6376":"This is a wonderful relaxing place to stay Lovely comfortable very clean room with a separate balcony to enjoy a drink in the sun. Buffet breakfast is good with unusual Sicilian pastries. There is a mini bar if you want anything and coffee and tea to make yourself. Parking is free on nearby streets. The owners are very welcoming. They had a map of the area and local book for the area which was useful. Can not recommend highly enough.  Also the shop opposite is wonderful for cakes. sandwiches, pizzas and arranchinis.","6381":"Only half an hour from airport. Good location, within easy walk to Mondello town and restaurants yet nicely away from noise and business of town. Food good on the whole, especially the anti pasta course, but expensive.","6383":"Traveled from Taramino, Sicily with our family of six. We visited the Splendid Ls Torre hotel during a heat wave in Europe and the a c was not adequate. The pool is large, but was too warm. The salt water in the pool was too salty and hurt the kids eyes. There was an old hot tub that was empty and should have been removed. We did go into the sea, and enjoyed that. Next door was a pool club that we accessed from the far end of the pool area. This was very nice. Good inexpensive food, two pools, spectacular views of the sea and the mountain behind. The hotel didn't tell us about it so I'm glad that I walked through the open back gate. The Mondello area was VERY crowded. You could barely walk around and really not worth the trouble. The breakfast included was very nice, although the dining room needed more A C. The surrounding streets are very dirty, sad because the area has a lot of potential. We did enjoy mixing with the locals walking around in the evening.","6386":"This is a nicely run, clean and friendly hotel in a great location on a peninsula on the edge of Mondello. I would strongly recommend upgrading to a full sea view room as they are much nicer and the views are spectacular. I would struggle to give this hotel 4* as facilities are not great eg poor quality of sun beds, barely any toiletries in bathroom, no bottles of water in rooms, dated bathrooms, no English tv channels. The main pool is fine but I would not recommend using the other available pools which are just outside the hotel complex - they are open to the public and it\u2019s like Butlins on a busy day ! The terrace and dinner restaurant have beautiful views across the bay. Waiters are of a far better standard than the food they have to serve but it\u2019s ok. The breakfast room is on the 4th floor - again lovely views. Breakfast is fine but would have preferred more fresh fruit. If it\u2019s your choice - selection of pastries looked great but I abstained ! Enjoyed freshly squeezed orange juice and plentiful coffee. Other good points include good free Wi-fi and reasonable priced drinks. Would recommend - good value and the best location in Mondello","6388":"Lovely clean rooms. Beautiful terrace overlooking sea. Swimming pool a very good size. Pool bar sells good food although, because food has to come from kitchen located a distance away, service not terribly quick.  Access to sea for swimming not easy and a bannister of some kind on the stone steps might help.  Food in hotel good although the main courses served to our group weren't ideal for vegetarians. Antipasti, soups and pasta dishes very good.  Staff very friendly and efficient.","6389":"This hotel is in a prominent position at the end of the Mondello bay. Mondello itself is extremely busy so Le Torre is in an ideal position. The hotel has three pools. However the two largest which look out on a wonderful bay is open to the public from the middle of June to September and is very very busy and noisy. I would suggest that the pool nearest the hotel should be designated as adults only. I would also suggest in the summer months that the opening times of the pool was extended: currently it is open from 9am to 6pm. The weather when we were there was beautiful and we would have liked to have spent longer in the late afternoon by the pool. I was one person in a group of twenty with Just You. I had paid for a sea view room which was worth it for the view. The room had obviously been newly decorated and there was an overwhelming smell of paint to the point hat I did not think I would be able to sleep that night. In the morning I handed reception a list of four things that were not working in my room: the air conditioning, hairdryer, electric blind and safe. In addition there was no TV remote control. I have to say that everything on my list was put right that day. Nevertheless I would have expected every room to be inspected prior to a new guest arriving to ensure that everything is working. Because we were a large group the evening meal was very limited ( we could not choose from the a la carte menu). The food was not good; the main course consisting of a choice of two meals, fish or meat. On two nights the fish was swordfish. There was only one vegetable offered with the main meal. There was no choice for desert. In comparison we visited the restaurant on an evening when a group meal was not provided and ordered from the a la carte menu which was extensive. The Veale Marsala was delicious. Breakfast was served in the Roof Garden. There was a large choice but it was the same every day. There was no fresh fruit, only fruit in syrup. There were whole oranges, apples and bananas however. Bread had to be put through the toaster six times before it resembled toast. There was a juicer to make your own fresh orange juice which was delicious. The rooms were basic and sparsely furnished with cheap table and chair. However they were clean and sheets and pillow cases were changed often. All staff were friendly and polite. Having visited many hotels around the world I would not class this as four star. It is more like a three star.","6393":"We were a family of 10 starting our vacation in Sicily. The view is spectacular! We had dinner there and Rosario and the wait staff gave us such a warm welcome to Sicily. The rooms, though small, were immaculate.  My only criticism and advice is to check your bill carefully. After returning home I noticed a 162 Euro charge for Arrangiamento? I have emailed twice to inquire about this charge and have not heard back.  This would not stop me from recommending the hotel, just advice to check the bill.","6411":"This hotel juts out at the end point of the Mondello neighborhood of Palermo. The hotel is well kept, and rooms generally have a great view of the bay. There is a beach and swimming, a nice bar and outside area for sitting for a drink, a large breakfast area with a splendid selection. Easy to walk to the nearby restaurants and shops. We enjoyed our stay here.","6415":"My stay at B&B Mannala was simply second to none. Pietro, the owner, went above and beyond to make my visit to Agrigento a real treat! I will definitely recommend Mannala to friends and family, and come back next time I am in town.","6416":"I was in this Hotel fo a 3 day vacation, In the past I've used the same hotel during my business trip. The sea view for the rooms and from the restaurant is really one of the best. The service is warm and professional and the reception personnel was able to solve all my needs.","6419":"We just stayed two nights at this hotel at the end of our trip to Sicily. The location and view of the Mediterranean Sea were wonderful. The hotel is located on a small peninsula at the end of the quaint fishing village of Mondello. The hotel is aging and needs a update, but our room was clean and spacious with a nice balcony to enjoy the view. There is a pool area and terrace bar overlooking the sea. Breakfast was served on the fourth floor with an equally great view of the sea. Great seafood restaurants within a ten minute walk of the hotel as well as a great beach in town.","6428":"I am so happy I chose this hotel for the 3 days prior to our tour of Sicily and Italy. I researched both this hotel and the Mondello Palace and both my husband and myself were even happier we made this choice when actually seeing the Mondello Palace hotel and its location. The Splendid Hotel La Torre accommodations were clean, comfortable, and the view from our balcony was amazing. Spend the money and take a room with an ocean view. The staff was always friendly and accommodating. The location was perfect, walking distance to the public park area, took a nice hike from there to the lighthouse. (Lighthouse not anything worth seeing, but the walk and the stop we made on a secluded beach was beautiful.) The hotel pool was gorgeous and refreshing. Again the location was perfect being at the end of the Mondello strip and within walking distance of the square with restaurants and shops. Only recommendation to the hotel would be to update the poolside bathrooms. Other than that, perfect!","6442":"This hotel was totally renovated and lovely. Unfortunately I was there in October and it was too cool to enjoy the beautiful pool. The room and bathroom were very clean. Breakfast was served daily. I would stay there again.","6448":"A nice hotel with large rooms but a very small shower. breakfast average at best. Clean, quiet but lots of mosquitos. Front desk controls the air conditioning so don\u2019t try to adjust in the room. Extra charge for pool towels.","6449":"We have just returned from a long weekend in Palermo. We had an excellent stay at La Terrazza sul Centro. The location provides the perfect base for seeing all the major sites of Palermo. Starting each day with breakfast on the beautiful terrace was unforgettable. Our bedroom was very comfortable and quiet, an advantage of being on the top floor. The owner, Barbara is charming as is Mary who serves breakfast. Would also recommend the airport transfer as a stress free means of reaching the hotel. No need for a car.","6450":"Stayed here one night as part of tour group. Average hotel on the sea - nice location. Lovely pool but it closed at 7pm so we couldn\u2019t use it. You need to wear a cap if you do swim - male or female. Dinner was quite nice breakfast was mediocre. The walls were extremely thin - could hear the entire phone conversation from the guy in the adjoining room. We had a nice balcony overlooking the sea.","6453":"A very good b& b right in the centre of Palermo near all the major tourist sites. Adequate breakfast on the lovely terrace , friendly staff and big comfortable rooms. Not suitable for those guests who couldn\u2019t climb 70 + stairs but kept us healthy! Would highly recommend this place for a short stay in Palermo","6462":"The B&B is in a beautiful old historic building (if you like the shabby chic feel of much of Sicily). breakfast is on a roof terrace which gives a real feel of the town and its surroundings. Staff are really kind and helpful, Everything is great - only small criticism is we didn't know there was no lift in the property. Would go back there again.","6463":"Accomodating hosts Emiliano and Barbara have fitted out their top floor place with comfortable guest rooms. Ours had a great view of a little piazza and two churches. Breakfast is delicious, with fresh cappucino available, and Barbara's home-cooked cakes. Only caveat: there is no elevator, but Emiliano lugged our luggage upstairs!","6473":"This is a beautiful establishment in the heart of the historic centre, two minutes walk from the Quattro Canti. It is located in an old Palazzo, and this is evident from the charming hallway, staircase, and elegantly decorated, high-ceilinged room I was allocated. The room had a small balcony from which I could admire the nearby Norman church, just past the friendly hustle and bustle of the coffee bar at the end of the street.  There is a fantastic roof terrace, always accessible, and this is where the breakfast is served. Breakfast was perfect for me - very good coffee, a selection of cereals and delicious homemade cakes and treats.  The service from the owners was exceptional, and I was made to feel very welcome from the start\u2013 I experienced a couple of issues on my trip that were nothing to do with the hotel, however, Barbara and Emiliano really went the extra mile to help me find a solution, which I hugely appreciated.  I really cannot recommend both Palermo and this hotel highly enough, and I hope to visit again one day.","6477":"Don\u2019t go for the hotel, go for the sights. Warning: like some Italian hotels there is a pool towel charge and mandatory shower cap in pool for all. Just another ploy to rip the guests off. Beds are hard as usual like most European hotels, Not at all like North American hotels!","6480":"This is the perfect place if you are travelling on your own. The location is perfect and the hosts friendly and informative. Breakfast is served with love and care. Rooms are clean and well designed. There is a safe and a small bar in the rooms. The terrace is amazing. The views from the top will help you understand the city.","6481":"Perfectly located for exploring Palermo. Nice rooms and a perfect bed. In the first night I was the only guest and got upgraded, for free, to a large room. Also, they made a large buffet breakfast for me only. Very nice and relaxing to sit in the faint november sunshine on the nice terrace. Got a lot of helpful tips. Only minuses I can think of is that there are a number of stairs to climb to get to the entrance (migh be a problem for some people) and that the door knobs were a bit difficult to grip and turn (might be an issue for someone with arthritis in hands).","6482":"This hotel is in a good location by the sea, but the building itself is very ordinary. Huge main .rooms with no redeeming features. The rooms were clean but the walls and floors were so thin we could hear everything people in other rooms were saying and doing. It really wasn't a good experience at all. Perhaps summed up as a typical coach trip hotel with hoards trying to get to the breakfast tables together.","6485":"Sea view room sounded good but on the first floor all you saw where the tops of trees. Nice enough room but paper thin walls meant we listened to next door's TV. Breakfast buffet poor. I finally got a decent coffee but it took an age.","6492":"Spent one night here on Jolly Tour. Room walls very thin - hear voices in adjoining rooms loud and clear. Shower in tub. Good wifi when up. Good breakfast. Comfortable bed. HVAC not in season (starts April 1). Open windows and got bit by mossies or midges.","6497":"We enjoyed this hotel which was comfortable with a pleasant breakfast and dinner in a huge dining room: good surroundings. Good room comfortable beds and good facilities. We were only there for a night in passing so did not get to enjoy the full facilities.","6498":"Great location, lots of bars and restaurants close by. For a cheap eat try Mounir which is only 5 mins away for a pizza \u20ac6-10. The B&b has an amazing breakfast with a breathtaking view. Great selection of fresh fruit, pastries, meats and cheeses set up outside where you can sit and relax and enjoy the beautiful view of the city. We had the \u2018Iris\u2019 room which was on the corner so had two balconies. The room itself was spacious and was cleaned daily and we were given new towels. The hosts were welcoming and offered us a variety of hot drinks to go with our breakfast. They also informed us of an air show by the port, the last one was held in Palermo 8 years ago so we were lucky to find out about it! We\u2019d definitely recommend; fantastic hosts, great breakfast and perfect location. We would definitely come back to Palermo it is beautiful! Just to note- there\u2019s about 60+ steps to take to reach La Terrazza so be prepared if you have a heavy suitcases like us!","6499":"Average sized rooms, nicely decorated but showing some signs of wear and tear. Food service was good. Location was good but really nothing much around. My biggest beef with this facility was the extremely poor wifi service. When I asked the front desk if they can do something to about the poor service, the staff member sort of shrugged off the problem and said that they can\u2019t do anything about it because the hotel was booked and they can\u2019t handle the demand. Well, what hotel doesn\u2019t plan and budget to have \u201cno vacancy\u201d. Therefore, they are not equipped to handle their customer demand. To further the disappointment, I got up a 4:00am and found the wifi still was poor. Don\u2019t tell me everyone got up at that time to use the wifi. Again, the less than comforting answer by the front desk staff did not help the situation","6500":"Stayed at the hotel for a 1 night. It was off-season so everything around the hotel was closed. The harbor and walk way were nice. Breakfast buffet was very good, the selection is the standard buffet food. The main problem with the hotel is you can not control the temperature of your room. You have a thermastate but it does nothing. The room was very cold.","6507":"A delightful 3-night stay at La Terrazza sul Centro in Palermo. Though the room was not spacious it was more than made up for by the wonderful rooftop terrace with brilliant old-town views, where breakfast was served. Barbera and Emiliano were the most friendly and helpful hosts we could have wished for, giving us restaurant ideas and laundromat directions and more, in good English. We loved the huge entranceway door off the cobbled laneway, and the beautiful old pink marble staircase showing the patina of centuries of wear.","6508":"Comfortable hotel nice room and bathroom after a rather hectic to the Valley of the Temples, with a nice bar and pleasant dining room with a veryfa good breakfast, found a pair of sneakers under the bed when we were leaving which had me wondering if the cleaning was a bit slapdash.","6513":"Excellent location, wonderful hosts who were so friendly, helpful and accommodating. We had a much needed relaxing break in a beautiful part of the world. Emiliano and Barbera had wonderful suggestions for us to experience what Palmero has to offer - although we might pass on the spleen sandwiches next time :-) we loved Palmero and will definitely go back. When we do return, we will also definitely be hoping to stay here. Thank you so much and best of luck with the extension work Jo and Brien xx","6515":"I stayed at this B & B for six nights and couldn\u2019t have chosen a better option. Everything was perfect! The location is at the Four Corners which is the exact center of the old, historic part of town. The owners, Barbara and Emiliano were the perfect hosts - friendly and very helpful. My room was extremely large as was the bathroom. Even had my own small outdoor sitting area. The B & B is located on the third floor without an elevator, but the advantage is that it is on the top floor with a lovely terrace with very nice views. It was a great terrace to have breakfast or a glass of wine after touring the city.  I thoroughly enjoyed my stay and would highly recommend this as the perfect place to stay in Palermo.","6517":"We stayed at this B&B for 4 days, and we had a great time. We got in late the first night, and they made sure we could check-in easily regardless of what time we arrived. It is incredibly central- several monuments are right down the street, several others within a ten minute walk, and one of the main pedestrian areas with shops and restaurants is right around the corner. There is also a free local bus that picks up right down the street and drives around the historical center of town. We took a bus from the airport that dropped us off less than 10 minutes from the hotel, so that was very convenient as well.  Barbara and Emiliano run the B&B, and they are so helpful. Anytime we wanted advice on where to eat, what bus to take, what monuments to see, etc., they were more than happy to sit us down and draw it out on a map. We got breakfast every day upstairs, which you can eat on the terrace (with a gorgeous view that I included a picture of) or inside with a view through a window. And we had a room with a view! The B&B is on the third floor with no elevator, so keep that in mind if you have problems climbing the stairs. We didn't have a problem with them. The bed was a little firm for our taste, but that's just a matter of preference. It may be perfect to someone else!  All in all, we had a great trip and would highly recommend this place! Thanks Emiliano and Barbara for being such great hosts!","6523":"La Terrazza is situated in the very heart of the old town in Palermo. It is ideal for walking to all the sights in the city. The owners Barbara and Emilio were extremely friendly and hospitable and nothing was too much trouble. The breakfast is taken out on the terrace with a beautiful view of the cathedral and Palermo's rooftops. There was a range of pastries, cereals and freshly made coffee. The room was spacious and clean. The bed was extremely comfortable.  If I returned to Palermo I would definitely stay there for its convenience, cleanliness and friendly owners.  La Terraza is a 6 to 10 minute walk from the train station. Even though I arrived late at night the owners emailed me the code for the front door and key. It was straightforward and no problem at all.","6529":"I booked this B&B for one night because of the many positive reviews, but I have to say I was very disappointed. First the good things about La Terrazza... The location is very good. We did everything by foot and the main attractions and comercial street are very close. I had no idea Palermo was so beautiful. Also, the breakfast terrace is very nice and the view is amazing. That being said, the rest was of our stay was a disaster. We arrived ate the B&B around 9 pm. We had previously told the owners of the time of our arrival, but they chose not to come to greet us, instead, they sent us a password to enter the building. We wouldn't mind that in normal circumstances, but the B&B surroundings are very strange at night (I'm sure they know that), and we got lost several times trying to park our car, because there was no one to help us... It was a very unpleasent thing. When we finally entered the room (there are considerable steps to the rooms, I recommend not carrying a lot of luggage), we just wanted to cry. The room smelled bad, it was very dirty, the wifi hardly worked e there was no water available, actually, there was nothing in the minibar (people that travel are always thirsty and sometimes hungry). The sheets were dirty as well and by that point we just wanted to get thru the night and leave the next day. I found out that the all positive reviews are probably because of a note they leave in the room, asking people not to give them a bad review. They don't leave any water but they leave a note. Well, I don`t recommend this place at all and I would`t stay there again.","6532":"I went to Sicily for a wedding with my partner, we were advised to stay at the Dioscuri Bay Palace Hotel. I was apprehensive when reading some of the reviews as there were a few negative ones but as there wasn't much choice for hotels in San Leone, we decided to give it a go. I was pleasantly surprised. Our stay was very relaxing, the pool was beautifully clean, amazing views from our room and we quite happily stayed in the hotel complex for whole days lounging by the pool. The hotel amenities were adequate, staff were friendly, cleaning staff were brilliant and there was a wide variety for breakfast. This is not a luxury stay but if you are looking for somewhere comfortable and peaceful then this is a good place to go. The hotel is positioned right by the sea. We had thought there was a beach right next to the hotel which there wasn't but there is one 5 minutes or so down the road. The hotel is placed right at the top of a strip of restaurants on the beachfront so it made finding somewhere to eat in the evenings easy. We wouldn't necessarily visit again as there wasn't much to do in San Leone other than the temples and we had only visited due to our friends getting married however overall we had a very pleasant and relaxing stay at the hotel and would recommend it for other couples or families. You do have to wear a swimming cap in the pool which you can buy at the pool bar for 2 euros which I was concerned about however everyone is wearing them and so it doesn't feel that odd once you are doing it!","6533":"It is located very centrally, with ample-sized rooms in a a somewhat tiny apartment. The view from the breakfast nook is beautiful. The proprietess bakes the cakes for the simple breakfast. Owners very nice to have picked us up, otherwise we would never find the place.","6535":"Great location near shops restaurants, but be careful...one wrong turn can put you in an unsavory unsafe area. Rooms were great and met our value. Barbara and Emiliano were very helpful. Can't beat the terrace view!","6540":"We found this B&B delightful. The rooms were comfortable and well thought out for the traveller. Breakfast was lovely on the terrace overlooking the city. Quiet and comfortable with the air-conditioning. And the location is superb for visiting the city. But best of all were the hosts, Barbara and Emileo. It is obvious they love running their B&B and the wishes of the guests are met with enthusiasm. If there was a downside, it could have been the 75 steps to take you to the 'pent house' of the building, but Emileo met us with a smile at the door and carried our luggage all the way up, with the comment, Coming from Australia, we thought you might have a large suitcase.' That comment was very thoughtful and showed us they cared for their guests.","6541":"Comfortable, clean and nice sized room. However we had no soap in the basin container and no shampoo - silly really. The hotel bar was pricey and literally over the road at the first stop bar prices were much cheaper. The water machine did not function properly either! One of our best things was that the room we had - we had a card and key - so when we went out in the heat - the air conditioner remained on! Bonus! Great pool overlooking the sea but one had to pay for a swimming cap! A pricey novelty! Lovely breakfast venue overlooking pool and a great selection. (staff led us on a wild goose chase to find a pharmacy - so if you need to find one - get details or use google maps - we never found one and walked for an hour!)","6547":"Went to Italy to attend a wedding and the hotel was phenomenal. The staff and facilities were great and they open the dining areas earlier for our group to get in and out and back to airport in Palermo. Our family members enjoyed it so much that some chose to stay for several days after the wedding","6550":"This hotel is to be avoided at all costs. The stench of decay or mould in all of our party's rooms must be a health hazard - issuing from the vents, unable to be controlled, and no air conditioning. No toiletries apart from an archaic Dove soap dispenser. Shower the shape and size of a coffin. Threadbare towels. Bed like concrete. Pool that is conveniently closed for the times travellers are likely to be there. Beach strewn with rubbish. Staff so atypically unfriendly for Sicily. We were told we were not guests and therefore not entitled to the unappetising display that purported to be a breakfast. There is something seriously amiss with this place - avoid. It quite literally stinks.","6553":"We stayed here one night on a Gate 1 tour the night before touring the Valley of the Temples. It was one of the worst hotels I've stayed in and the worst on the Sicily itinerary. The location is far from anything. There is nowhere to walk. They require you to pay for a towel for the pool (2 euros) and they require you to wear a swim cap in the pool. Most people don't pack a swim cap so they charge you an additional 3 or 4 euros for the swim cap. No where else in Sicily did a hotel require a swim cap. I also take exception to a hotel guest being charged for a towel for the pool. I paid neither for the towel or the cap and opted not to swim. Unfortunately the area of the Mediterranean on which the hotel is located is not amenable to swimming. There is no real beach and the coast in the back of the hotel, adjacent to the pool, is full of trash. There were no toiletries in my room upon check in and I had to go to the front desk to ask for them. The front desk staff was very unfriendly. There are other options in Agrigento and I recommend that you avail yourself of them. I have also lodged a complaint about this hotel with Gate 1 tours.","6556":"Agrigento was a pleasant surprise. However, this hotel was the worst of 6 we stayed at while touring Italy. You can tell that it used to be really nice but is past its heyday and in dire need of some TLC. The rooms were pretty large by European hotel standards, but the air conditioner was broken, and there were no fans. The thermostat read 28.5C (83F) in our room. Sweat was literally dripping down my face and back. When we complained, they said that they didn't have fans but we could open our patio doors, as the night was cool. We put our security concerns aside (as we were on the 2nd floor) and left the doors open so that we could sleep. But the next morning, my husband was covered with mosquito bites. (I slept enshrouded in a sheet. The pool looked nice, but inexplicably, there were ropes around it the entire time we were there.","6565":"The hotel was designed for large events and conferences with grand reception areas and tons of space. The pool was absolutely wonderful, with a nice view of the city. The rooms were a bit older, but comfortable.","6575":"Efficient service at reception and when asked to provide light bulb. A tea kit was available on request. A notice asks guests not to use cookers etc in their rooms. A generous bedroom. Fridge. No frills. Clean. Thin partition walls. Lovely sea view. We could see huge breakers crashing down on the harbour wall due to a storm in the Med. No chance to test the swimming pool. There was a smell of drains. We did have the balcony door open, in preference to the air con. I did get a mozzie bite but it was worth it. Eating out wasn\u2019t attractive on a stormy, windy night, so didn\u2019t bother. The sea front would come to life on a normal day. We had a different experience from some. The room prices are very reasonable for what one gets. These hotels, used for group holidays have a lot of hard wear but are practised in providing for the general need.","6582":"We stayed here for three nights with a group. Having read the reviews it was with some trepidation. Check in was efficient and we were soon in our room, sharing a corridor with the other seven members of our group. We also shared the room with a couple of mosquitos: we promptly swatted them and decided to refresh the air with the air conditioning and keep the large balcony doors closed for the duration of our stay. I refrained from fiddling with the air conditioning because they are notoriously temperamental, and so room temperature was too cool to sleep comfortably. However the hotel had provided blankets; mine had a large burn hole. The walls are thin, but noises from people you know are much more tolerable than those caused by strangers. The towels are thin too; my bath towel had a small hole. Breakfast was not bad, but ruined by synthetic orange juice in its gaudy dispenser. Why can't they provide a manual orange press and a pile of oranges on an island bursting with orange trees? The surprise was a basket of mandarin oranges - absolutely delicious. We had a problem with the electrics. For three days the fuse for our group of rooms kept jumping out resulting in having no lights and even being locked out. Our bathroom light was always on: we tried out all the switches, both inside and outside the bathroom but to no avail. Then the final surprise came when running the bath after a long hiking day - brown water.  Not surprisingly we will not be returning.","6583":"We were here only one night. As it was off-season, there was no crowd. The views of the sea were excellent. The room was quiet and comfortable.  The staff were all friendly and helpful. The provided breakfast was very good.","6585":"This hotel has a great location. That was the pro in singular. Against - when you walk into the lobby you get the sinking feeling. The hotel has lost its sparkle. The rooms are in need of an update, the shower is tiny, the drains in the bathroom smell, the dining room is drab and at breakfast some not very pleasant attendant tells you, where you are allowed to sit. There is no coffee service but a machine, there is no fresh orange juice on the island of oranges and you just feel they are going through the motions. Only stayed for one night at part of a trip around the island. Would not want to stay longer.  If you have allergies the breakfast buffet is a gluten feast, but there are ice cold pieces of fruit or yogurts.","6593":"The bedroom and bathroom were hard floored and not well maintained. Room noisy in the night-time due to noises elsewhere in the building.The bar staff were offhand, the breakfast poor and not well staffed either. It is a conference and tour groups hotel I think and all their energies go that way. No real service or standards","6594":"We stayed here for 3 nights and it was wonderful. The rooms (and bathrooms) were large, spacious and clean. The beds were comfortable. There is a mini fridge for water. The breakfasts in the morning are fantastic - pastries, fruit, ham cheese, cannolis, tea coffee and fresh squeezed orange juice (delicious!). The location is central to restaurants, both local and touristy, as well as a lot of shopping. The 2 theaters are right next door. The best part of the place is the host, Giuseppe. He goes out of his way to welcome you and make you feel at home. He is a very kind human being. We came in very late and left very early and he was able to accommodate us and arrange for transportation in the wee hours of the morning. We will definitely stay here again and you should too.","6598":"A little hard to find but once we did we could not have asked for a better place to be - from the start, Giuseppe welcomed us and showed us around - we had a wonderful room with lots of space - the whole place was very clean and tidy - the staff wonderful and the breakfasts were the best ever. The B&B was very well situated to different areas of Palermo and Giuseppe's recommendations were the very bedst. Thank You Giuseppe!","6600":"We spent one week (Oct 2019) in Palermo and stayed in Palazzo Pantaleo: a very good choice!! The location of the hotel (B&B) is very central and especially the service in the hotel was great. Giuseppe and his team served very good breakfast, kept the room clean and was helpful when needed.","6601":"Wonderful B&B. Elegant and modest at the same time. Nice continental breakfast on the terrace. Location is superb - centrally located, but set back from busy streets. All the main attractions are within walking distance, and there are many fine restaurants nearby. The owner-host, Giuseppe, is kind and helpful. He is always available when needed, and he speaks fluent English. He responds to emails in a very timely manner. Highly recommend!","6603":"Great location in a safe area (Roggero Settimo shopping street), A short walk to all historic sites (Theatro Massimo, Cathedral, markets, pedestrian street, ...). Unique advantage to those coming by car - free parking available in the building inner courtyard (rather packed but there is an assistant managing it). Big rooms, very good breakfast. The owner Giuseppe is very pleasant, helpful and accomodating.","6604":"Well situated in the center of town. Run impeccably by Giuseppe. Rooms are spacious, well appointed and relatively quiet for the center of the city. Breakfast is substantial and yummy. Our only regret was having to depart after one night.","6606":"This little hotel is a gem. The proprietor, Giuseppe, was delightful and extremely helpful. He organized a trip to Monreale. The breakfast was delicious, coffee, fresh squeezed juice, croissants, cakes, fruit, cannoli, cheese and meat, and cereal. Our room was large with a sitting area. And the location was on the best street in the city.","6608":"We arrived after 9:00pm to Palermo airport and took a taxi (very easy - cost 45euro) to the B&B. PP is located off the main street in a gated courtyard - very easy to find once you figure it out. Giuseppe was waiting for us to arrive and helped escort us up the lift to the 3rd floor. Our room was right in the front - high ceilings, bright and very clean. Some noise from the street but only because we chose to keep the window open. Breakfast was just perfect - lots of fresh fruit, pastries and coffee...perfect for getting us started for the day. Giuseppe goes out of his way to help if asked and gave great restaurant recommendations. (LOVED Bisso Bistro!) The location is perfect - just a short, very safe walk to the pedestrian only centre. My only complaint is that we spent just two nights...could really have spent three. Would definitely return and stay again.","6612":"We truly trusted TA and Rick Steves forum reviews and were not disappointed. Excellent location, it\u2019s well organized, every necessary convenience, and great parking. Best of all is Giuseppe the most congenial host ever. There is nothing he won\u2019t do to maximize your Palermo experience.","6614":"We spent two nights here and could really have done with an extra night in Palermo. The Palazzo is just off one of the main streets but the owner\u2019s instructions made it easy to find. It is literally only a few steps from the airport bus stop. Our room was large and comfortable and we were made to feel at home by Guiseppe, the proprietor. Breakfast is served in a lovely light filled terrace. The Palazzo is very central and we walked everywhere, including the Cathedral, Norman Palace and the Archeological Museum. There are plenty of restaurants nearby for dinner and Guiseppe will give suggestions for dinner and answer any other question you have. Highly recommended.","6618":"Stayed two nights in this absolutely beautiful B&B. It has free parking in the courtyard outside although when we arrived the main street was blocked off & pedestrianised! But Guiseppe just gave us a pass to come straight through and park. There is a sign on the main street into the courtyard but then once in the courtyard it isn\u2019t exactly obvious (it\u2019s in the open doorway surrounded by foliage.) It\u2019s location is ideal for exploring Palermo on foot, just round the corner from Piazza Politeama and about 5 minutes walk from Teatro Massimo. The B&B is on the top floor of an old palazzo and has retained some of the grandeur with high ceilings, spacious rooms and beautiful decor. Plus there is a lift up which is ideal with heavy luggage. Breakfast was a continental buffet served on the covered air-conditioned terrace and had plenty to offer. We would definitely recommended Palazzo Pantaleo for anyone looking for a central B&B in Palermo.","6620":"Spent 7 nights here and enjoyed ourselves based in a clean organised hotel run by an exceptional and considerate owner in Giuseppe who single handed runs the show ably assisted by cleaning support staff and sorting a reasonable breakfast selection  Centrally located and provides easy options to use public transport, walk to many of the wonderful tourist venues especially the Cathedrals and Royal Palace  A great ciy full of life and bustle; closure of main roads at the weekend enable families to walk free of traffic and fumes!  Go and enjoy!!","6621":"There was no room for our dates, but there was in their next door building penthouse. The rooms are small, but Cost a little less, include the same lovely breakfast at the main pallazzo. There is a nice big terrace on the same level as the penthouse with great views of the city. Room is very clean, AC works great, free water in fridge. Giuseppe, quite a character, was a wonderful host and the staff were great too. Would definitely stay here or at the main part whenever in Palermo!","6622":"Thank you so much Camere a Sud, this is what our custumers wrote us about your experience: \u201cFabulous location and it was nice change to be in town so that we could walk around and be apart of the action. Our hosts were so kind and considerate it was a pleasure to stay here Thank you again and...keep going like this :) wanderjack.it","6625":"Spent 3 nights here in June. Very convenient location just off the main high street not far from the bus and train stations. Wide choice of restaurants in the immediate vicinity. Room was delightful with a comfortable bed and fine art on the walls. Bathroom was well equipped and a nice hot shower. Excellent wi-fi. Spotless throughout. Breakfast was very good with a wide variety of fare. Elvira was multilingual and was an expert on the local area. The \u2018breakfast lady\u2019 was lovely and pleasant. Rates very reasonable.","6630":"In my mind this place is the best place to stay in Palermo. If you choose it you will be at walking distance both of all the interesting sites of the old town(avoiding the crowd) and in the middle of a shopping area with a lot of fashionable stores. The rooms are spacious and the bedding very comfortable.During the warm days of early July we appreciated the cold drinks at our disposal.Breakfast was tasty and healthy with a lot of fresh fruit. The terrace was such a wonderful surprise. The site has a parking in the back yard. Last but not least we appreciated a lot the owner of this amazing place,Giuseppe whose availability, helpful tips and discreet presence kindly helped us all along our Palermitan escape.","6631":"Centrally located in the elegant city of Agrigento. Elvira was very accommodating with time of arrival and allowed us to leave our bags while sightseeing. The room was artistically decorated and offered a home-like ambiance. Although the shower was small, the bathroom was very clean.  Breakfast the next morning (an additional fee) was well worth it and offered Sicilian specialty foods.","6633":"This B&B is a reasonably priced renovated quiet building off the main drag of Settimo Ruggiero near the Mossimo theater and is at least as old as Giuseppe, the owner, who is a spry 77 year old. He was born in this building. Giuseppe is responsive to emails, has a good understanding of the English language, can lend any adaptor you need, and not to worry, he can pretty much come up with a plan to make your stay in Sicily memorable. His recommendations for restaurants were spot on and he will put together a breakfast for you if you have an early morning flight. Breakfast included an array of fruits, try the melons, peaches and apricots, torts, cookies, croissants, breads with butter and jams, yogurts, cereals, cheese and prosciutto, freshly squeezed orange juice (saw the staff doing this), tea, milk and coffee. There is parking that comes with this B&B but it is a little difficult to find. We had to call Giuseppe to find it but it was nice not to worry about where to park. The hotel rooms are on the third floor and you will need to take a small elevator to get there. There is a small lobby areas, a garden type room to dine in and Giusppe\u2019s office. In our room, #1, shower pressure and air conditioning is excellent and the rooms are big by European standards. My 2 adult children had their own 2 room apartment with a shared bath and all bathrooms contain bath soap products and shower gel. There is a mini-fridge with a tiny freezer in each room. Our room had a room with a toilet, bidet and sink, The second bath contains a shower and sink, a nice touch for early mornings when you are trying to get out. There is a wardrobe with hangers, a chest of drawers, a small balcony, a desk and chairs.There is a TV with nothing but Italian channels. It is a 10 minute walk from the port and the markets. We would book here again.","6635":"We stayed at a B&B called Palazzo Pantaleo in the centre of Palermo at the start of our tour of Sicily. It is well-located for visiting the main centre attractions.  We caught the bus from the airport and it was only a couple of minutes walk to the B&B. It is set within a little piazza making it relatively quiet but it was a bit of a challenge getting into the place as the only lift is tiny (retro-fitted into an older building) but adequate.  The room was generous and spotlessly clean with an en suite bathroom.  Breakfast was provided in a pleasant bright dining area and was basic continental fare.  Generous without being fancy.  Guiseppe the owner and host was around most of the time and was pleasant and helpful as were his staff.  Plenty of shops, cafes and restaurants basically at the door.  Also a supermarket within 3 minutes walk.  No car necessary here and we picked up our hire car as we left.","6636":"Cute little family run, clean B&B. Great location and helpful hosts. Good value for money with a lovely breakfast. Have to park (payable in some zones) about a 5 minute walk away as b&b located in a limited access zone. Owner can facilitate access by car for dropping off picking up luggage if required but we found it less hassle to just walk with our cases - it wasn\u2019t a problem for us. Would def go back.","6637":"Palazzo Pantaleo is located in the middle of Palermo at a peaceful courtyard where you can park your car without extra costs. From there is an easy access to all Palermo\u2019s main sights by foot. The room and the bathroom was very spacious and clean. The furniture was well suited to the atmosphere of the Palazzo. The breakfast was marvelous, there were e.g. fress pressed orange juice and strawberries available every morning. The host Giuseppe and his staff were very frendly and nice. All in all we enjoyed our stay very much.","6639":"Two days before we arrived in Agrigento we received an email through Expedia to call the hotel as soon as possible. We called to find out the hotel had made a mistake, was overbooked, and one of our two rooms would be 100m down the road in an equivalent location. Having to separate from family was far from ideal seeing as we are on a family holiday and I booked 5 months beforehand. Our \u2018equivalent\u2019 accommodation is 60 ranks lower on the Trip Advisor ranking and all we have received by way of apology from the hotel owner is complaints about Expedia. If Expedia isn\u2019t the platform for a small hotel - don\u2019t use them - but don\u2019t leave us on the end of such a shocking experience.","6640":"I don't normally write reviews but I want to thank Giuseppe and his staff for such an enjoyable stay while I was in Palermo! Traveling alone from Los Angeles, Giuseppe made feel so welcome and inviting. He suggested what things to visit and which buses to take. He also helped me with my Italian which I am studying at the moment :)  The B&B is spotless and my little room was very spacious. The breakfast was a large spread of pastries, cold cuts, cereals, fruit, etc. I told them that their coffee was one of the best I ever had. The B&B is in a perfect location. It is within walking distance to so many landmarks and shopping areas. I had a very early flight the day of my departure and Giuseppe had arranged a taxi the day before.  The next time I am in this beautiful city, I will only stay at Palazzo Pantaleo!!  Chris","6642":"This is a wonderful place to stay while in Palermo. I am only sorry that my husband and I had only two nights here. Giuseppe is a truly special host, very caring about his guests and attentive. We had to leave early in the morning and he made sure breakfast was there for us before we left. The rooms are extremely spacious and elegant. Clean and comfortable with everything you need. We also found the location to be excellent- off a busy shopping street, very quiet and yet easy walking distance of the old town. We would not hesitate to stay here again when in Palermo.","6646":"Very nice, clean rooms with an exceptional typical Italian breakfast. Outstanding location at the edge of the historic Old Town of Palermo. On a busy street but very quiet. Guiseppe is a fantastic host. This is not a luxury hotel, but truly a great value!","6647":"Elvira has created a subtly colourful environment matched by her own lively youthful sparkle. A wonderful welcome in this uniquely beautiful historic town. We enjoyed our balcony overlooking the cheerful main street  Breakfast was a real pleasure.","6658":"Senior Guiseppi is a gentleman & runs a spic & span B & B. The main Plazzao was full so he gave us a room in the opposing section, but in the penthouse. He was rather apologetic as he said the rooms were small but is was not so bad; was well appointed & colourful & it had a Sliding door to the most spectacular terrace which over looked the Teatro Politama. My wife & i were in heaven- how can you have better accommodation than this. Plenty of bottled water, tea, coffee in the corridor. A wonderful breakfast in the main building. The price is a bit high for the size of the room but I would come back & stay a month. The only problem was that my wife has latex allergy & we suspect the mattress bothered her & she could not sleep, so we left the next day. Shame; one of the best rooms ever! He kindly arranged a taxi to the Airport- who drove like a Diablo possessed by Satan's Mother in Law!!! And we paid Euro 50 for the pleasure. Took the bus back when we realiszed that the flight was the next day. G did recommend an excellent restaurant- Spinnato. Hope to return one day soon.","6660":"We very much enjoyed our stay at the Pallazzo Pantaleo. This B&B is well located within walking distance to the major sights in old Palermo. The B&B is located in a courtyard off one of the main streets of Palermo, but it was very quiet and very secure. The B&B is located on the top floor and has an elevator. The B&B was very clean, and our room was very large and very quiet. Breakfast was served in a sunny breakfast room and was plentiful. We arrived late at night and Guiseppe arranged for a driver to pick us up at the airport, and we appreciated his making those arrangements for us. Despite the late hour, Guiseppe was waiting for us when we arrived at the B&B and he is a very gracious gentleman. We would absolutely stay here again.","6661":"Our room was spacious and clean with a modern bathroom, good A C, decent breakfast, good price, they did our laundry and good location. A ways from the train station, but pretty centrally located to the sights. It had outdated furniture and the mattress was too soft and needed replacing. It was also not as peaceful as we would have liked. You could hear conversations from other rooms thru the walls and vents. And as there is no carpet or rugs, everything echoed. Footsteps and clattering from the breakfast room and doors slamming. When we arrived, it took about 15 minutes for the owner to open the gate to let us into the courtyard, which was frustrating. Good thing we had a cell phone to call him.","6664":"We have just had two nights at this B and B. I agree with the recent reviews in every way. Giuseppe was a great host and was always there to help. We got the bus from the airport and a very short walk to the rooms. Location is perfect in a building set back from the busy Main Street, so very quiet, but only a short walk to the old section of Palermo. We had booked the larger suite, which had a separate lounge area. Bathroom is large and everything was very neat and clean. Would recommend this place.","6666":"My husband and I stayed here last month and it was fabulous. This was a recommendation from a friend who had stayed here and I too would have no hesitation in recommending it to anyone. Guissepe is a character and extremely friendly with a great sense of humour. The room and bathroom were spacious with all that you need for a very comfortable stay. The breakfast, and especially the coffee, was great and plentiful. All the staff were very personable and helpful. It was very secure with a locked gate at night and special lift access. When you walk out onto the street you are in the middle of everywhere you want to be and access to anywhere in Palermo is easy. I cannot speak highly enough of this B&B - make it your place of choice!","6668":"We stayed 3 nights at this B&B. The owner Giuseppe was always available throughout our stay and was most helpful. We had a room in the annex, away from the main building. Our room was clean and comfortable, good size bathroom. We had access to the most outstanding large beautiful terrace. Great location, price is right and decent breakfast. Highly recommend!","6672":"My wife and I just stayed four nights in Guissepe's B&B. I'm going to sound like repetition of the other reviewers who loved his place. He couldn't have been a nicer host. The room was large, clean and kept clean during our stay. The breakfasts were excellent, with many choices. We took the airport bus into the city and his directions were perfect. His place is a short walk from the bus stop just as he said, maybe 30 meters. The location is also perfect for walking to all the must see tourist sites. You won't find a nicer host or better location.","6674":"First, I have to say Thank You to Giuseppe. He was a wonderful host. Very funny and very accommodating. A little hard to find (in an alley) but well worth the stay. Our room was very comfortable, good bed, ALWAYS plenty of bottled water, and the breakfast was out of this world. When we checked in, Giuseppe made us feel right at home. He joked with us the whole time and made us feel like we were family. The B&B is right in the middle of Palermo. Close to everything. We spent 4 night with him. If you ever go to Sicily, do yourself a favor and stay with Giuseppe. You will not be sorry. Thank you again Giuseppe. Joseph and Veronika!","6675":"Stayed 4 nites. Great location just off main street in old town, walkable to all. Guissepe very helpful and nice breakfast. Old well cared for palazzo, great rooms. AC and Wi-Fi were great. Highly recommend.","6677":"The main building was full for our dates so we stayed in the dependence. This consists of 3 rooms on the top floor of a building just across the courtyard, with a lift and stairs just for the last floor. The rooms are a little smaller but nicely furnished with neat bathrooms. There is a large shaded roof terrace for the sole use of these 3 rooms, big enough for each to have a separate area and table and views over Palermo. One of these has its own access to the terrace and the other two have access via a corridor which also has a fridge and kettle for guest use. There is a disadvantage to having a little trip to get to breakfast but otherwise the access to the terrace was a distinct bonus for us. The only discomfort was the night of a power-cut and no air-con!","6679":"This is a lovely spot. In the middle of everything - even beautiful high end shopping and good restaurants - and yet quiet and seculed tucked just back of the Main Street overlooking a courtyard and behind a secured gate. Big comfortable room. Giuseppe will make sure your needs are met - from car services to restaurants and everything in between. All-in-all a great place to be in Palermo.","6681":"Big room, very clean, quality bathroom, and quiet and effective air con - a winning combination. Breakfast was simple but spot on, with cereal, a lot of fresh fruit, and superb pastries. Giuseppe was welcoming and available but not intrusive, with a wonderful dry sense of humour. It was back off the Main Street, so nice and quiet, and close to the bus stop from the airport and to get to the beach. A bit of a walk to the old town but all fine. Worked really well for us.","6686":"You will be welcomed to the B&B by friendly and helpful Giuseppe. The rooms are very large and comfortable with plenty of room to make yourself at home. The breakfast is plentiful and delicious. Great location close to all the sights. Our party of 4 all enjoyed our stay. Bonus- Guiseppe speaks wonderful English.","6691":"We used our Garmin to find it, and the steps leading up to a small square where the B & B shared space with a taverna. The house belonged to our veruy helpful hostess's Grandmothr and has been restored to a very modern and comfortable state. Breakfast was not bad but not inspiring, otherwise a very nice stay.","6692":"This is wham bang in the centre of things. The old guy that runs the place is a bit of a joker, but in a good way, and the service is excellent. I promised to write this review, and I stand by my word. Even has parking. Loved it:-)","6694":"This is a hotel located on (I think) 3rd and 4th floor of a nondescript building. You do not want to miss the interiors of the rooms, which are truly amazing (see pictures). The location is in the very center of Palermo. The host is a one of a kind. So decent, friendly and helpful above all expectations. We loved our stay, and will be back here whenever in Palermo...","6696":"This B&B offers an unbeatable confluence of location, quality, hospitality, and price. In years past, we stayed at several hotels in Palermo, including the Palme and the Joli, but we would not think of returning to them after having been Giuseppe's guest. Located on Via Ruggiero Settimo, one of the principal avenues of the city center (which has become even more a center of Palermo's night--as well as day--life than was the case many years ago), Palazzo Pantaleo is within only steps of the picturesque Politeama Theater and the Via della Liberta', in one direction, and only a few blocks, in the other direction, from the imposing Teatro Massimo. Most of the principal monuments of the city are within about only 20 minutes by foot from Pantaleo (one can also pick up the hop-on hop-off bus near the Politeama that will do a decent job of introducing newcomers to the city and helping them to access some monuments they perhaps might not otherwise visit). The rooms are spacious, artfully decorated, and spotlessly clean, and although it's located on one of the busier streets, one never hears the sounds of the city at night, thanks to the fact that the rooms are located around an inner courtyard only a few meters from Via Ruggiero Settimo. The breakfast was varied and enjoyable, stocked with an enticing array of fresh fruit as well as pastries and bread, and it was served on a very pleasant enclosed porch. Giuseppe, the owner, is a marvelously generous, patient, helpful, and courtly host, and the rest of the staff at the Pantaleo are also very polite and helpful. We felt very welcomed by everyone and delighted to have found, by chance, such a jewel hidden in the very thick of this fascinating city. Finally, among the many favors he did for us, Giuseppe arranged for a taxi to pick us up at 5:00 am on the morning of our departure from Sicily--it arrived punctually, the driver was exceedingly polite, and Giuseppe thus spared us the minor headache of figuring out how to make such arrangements. We highly recommend this place and do so with reservation only because we don't want it to get so popular that we won't be able to get a room in the future!","6697":"Great B & B in the historical center of Agrigento. Very nice neighborhood. Great host, nice and helpful. The decoration is excellent, it is clean, there is a nice terrace on the roof. It is a B & B full of charm and very affordable.","6698":"This hotel is in an an alley off the Main Street in downtown Palermo. We were met by Giuseppe who quickly showed us to our room. We were really surprised by the size of the room for a b&b- quite large well appointed with modern bathroom.. Breakfast was delicious each morning and Giuseppe even did a load of washing for us at no charge... Tips...don\u2019t go out for dinner before 8pm - nothing is open..","6700":"We stayed in seven hotels on our recent trip to Sicily and considering comfort, location, quality, management, breakfast and all things that make a hotel great, Palazzo Pantaleo measured up to be the best! It's truly a gem in a city that took my breath away. Palermo is a city of scholars, artists, foodies, sea, sun, culture, shopping, palaces and cathedrals. Our trip would have been wonderful wherever we stayed in Palermo, however, making the choice to stay at Palazzo Pantaleo made it just that much extra special. The Innkeeper, Giuseppe is absolutely wonderful, helpful, knowledgeable and a true class act. The staff, lead by Jenny, was just magnificent and the real backbone of this hotel. We loved it and won't think twice about staying anywhere else the next time we visit wonderful Palermo!!","6716":"During our trip around Sicily this accomodation has the most comfortable bed. Free parking just 5mins by walk. Spacious room (2 persons). Location very good - city centre. 25 minutes to Eracloa Minoa, 15 minutes to Scala dei Turchi, 6 minutes to Vallei dei Templi.","6723":"We spent four nights at this well located small hotel. Close to Piazza Politeama which is ideal for the frequent airport bus. Very clean and comfortable large room. Quiet considering the location. Guiseppe was very helpful and hospitable with good advice about what to do and see in Palermo. Would definitely recommend Palazzo Pantaleo to anyone visiting this city. David & Hana Scammell","6726":"We spent 4 nights at this charming B&B and it was the perfect place to make as a base for exploring Palermo and for a day trip to Monreale. It is close to Teatro Massimo and an easy walk to many of the key sites and great restaurants, gelato shops and pasticcerias in Palermo. The owner, Giuseppe, was very kind, generous and helpful. Our room was clean, quiet and very spacious and there were many things to choose from at breakfast.","6728":"We stayed three nights in this wonderful place. The room and the bathroom were nice and clean. The place is perfectly located near Teatro Massimo and many other interesting places and at the same time quiet. The breakfast is fine with fresh orange juice and good coffee. Mr Guiseppe was very nice and helpful and gave us valuable local advice where to eat etc. We just can confirm all the positive reviews and we would definitively stay here again if we come back to Palermo.","6730":"What a fantastic place! Giuseppe has nailed the B&B concept - comfortable, friendly, spacious, clean, characterful rooms and a brilliant breakfast. Plus the location is great for exploring Palermo on foot. And there's even parking outside if you've got a car. A real oasis.","6741":"This was a great find. Excellent location in the center of the city. Super service, the host is friendly and helpful. Make sure they know when you are coming as it\u2019s hard to get inside without the door code and at night. But they will accommodate you. The breakfast was across the courtyard in another building but not hard find. The room was modest but the terrace was OUTSTANDING. So pretty and huge! Such a good value for the price. Will for sure stay again!!","6743":"We had a very warm welcome from Guiseppe who went to great lengths to help us to settle in. This B and B is very conveniently located in the centre of Palermo and all the major attractions, shops and restaurants are easily accessible. The secured parking area is a real bonus and the room was spacious, tastefully decorated and tranquil. There was a good choice for breakfast - fruit, orange juice, yoghurt, cereals and a wide choice of pastries. We would definitely stay here again.","6745":"This BB is wonderful. The location perfect, the rooms large, clean, quiet, etc. Breakfast is plenty, with many choices. An Giuseppe, the owner, a great human being, fantastic sense of humor that makes this place deserve six and not five starts. We strongly recommend this BB.  Carla and Saul","6746":"We had a great stay with Giuseppe in what I would term the center of Palermo, and they have their own secure parking. Liked its simplicity and friendly good service. Our Penthouse room was clean and tidy. When We visit Palermo again that's where we will stay. Breakfast was simple and fresh.... fruit, croissant and great strong coffee.","6747":"Nice size rooms in a good location near shops, restaurants and historic sites. Giuseppe was very helpful and accomodating. He made restaurant reservations for us at good restaurants that were nearby. He also arranged for drivers to take us to from airport and to various site-seeing places. The b&b is in a private courtyard that is secured by a gate at night. There is an elevator that goes up to the b&b. The breakfasts are very good, Nice selection of fresh fruits and pastries and fresh squeezed orange juice.","6748":"We stayed 3 nights. Location was great; we walked to Teatro Massimo, Palermo Cathedral, the Royal Palace and Cappella Palatina, passed through the Four Corners and visited several churches. Lots of restaurants and stores nearby along with ATM. Security gate to parking lot closes after 8PM and a private elevator to the B&B; there was a safe in our room. Great bathrooms. As close as it was to a busy street the room was quiet. Giuseppe was such a gentleman and extremely helpful with our travel arrangements. Arranged a private driver for us to go to Segesta, Erice and Trapani salt field with the windmills. We enjoyed our stay very much. Thank you Giuseppe and TaTa (our driver)!","6750":"Giuseppe runs an excellent B and B with good staff and a friendly and somewhat droll approach to life and its tribulations. He loves to fix taxi visits to Monreale and other destinations, advises on restaurants and key places to visit. A dab hand at lift maintenance and no doubt other aspects of life that don't behave well. Excellent breakfasts. We will certainly recommend this lovely place to our friends.","6752":"We are just back from 10 days in Palermo, all spent with Giuseppe in his wonderful palazzo. The room was great, the breakfasts extensive and always been topped up even for late risers, and the location is ideal, just off Politeama square. The rooms are very secure, with a dedicated lift and other security aspects too and we would recommend it wholeheartedly.","6762":"Marco was a perfect host! Very informative and helpful. Buffet breakfast was lovely- good selection of pastries, cheese and meats. Room was very clean and the place as a whole, was in a perfect location. Would highly recommend.","6777":"The room was nice and clean albeit a bit small. The shower was extremely small. The air conditioner worked well. We were on the second floor with no elevator. Breakfast was on a beautiful balcony on the third floor. Very reasonably priced.","6789":"We were 3 couples using 3 rooms. We were all highly satisfied. Rooms were clean. Breakfast was provided with sweet service. Cappuccino very good! Marco provided great tips on restaurants (affordable and delicious ones), and tourist information. He aims to please. The shower in my room was a little difficult to manage, and I would have appreciated tissues, besides toilet paper, but I soon discovered they are hard to get in B&Bs, hotels, and even an Airbnb - all over our travels in Sicily and Calabria. Finding this B&B was a challenge, as it\u2019s on a pedestrian street and the door blends into the facade. There is s small sign - look for it! Elevator is tiny; we often used the stairs, a few flights up. Good exercise! This was a nice place with reasonable prices. Great location, too. Recommend!","6797":"Room in general was big and nice view for the sea and country side. Its in the old center of Agrigento, you can reach the main station, shopping area, restaurants, HopON-HopOff buses, etc. Breakfast is amazing on the terrace and has many options. The lady serving you is so so nice and helpful. You have a hanger for the clothes as well (after beach is useful). The man (owner) waiting for me on the first day was not so helpful and seems totally careless. Explained me nothing, just gave the key and left, even if he told that will give me information. The furniture is a bit old, but acceptable. Shower was not so clean. The room on the 1.st floor is a bit noisy as everyone closing the main entrance really heavily. In the morning it can disturbe the guest sleeping.","6812":"Opera is located inside a preserved beautiful, old building in the heart of Palermo in a very nice area with good restaurants and cafes. Breakfast, although had not huge variety of choices, was very decent and sufficient. The rooms were simple, clean and cosy. We didn't want anything luxurious anyway. Marco, the owner, is the highlight! Classic Italiano, very friendly, always polite and willing to help you. The only negative for us was that the walls were not soundproof, we could hear everything around us, especially in the morning we could hear Marco and the other clients from the reception and this was very annoying.","6813":"As a lot of others on here have said, it is not an easy B&B to find if you are driving. Giuseppe helped guide us to the place and was outside greeting us when we drove up. The accommodations were great and Giuseppe gave us several suggestions for restaurants, shopping and recommended we not miss the Scala dei Turchi after visiting the Valley of the Temples. The room was clean and we had a great view of the Valley. The Terrace, where breakfast is served, is great. Really appreciated all of the suggestions Giuseppe made - Agrigento would not have been as wonderful without this!!","6818":"We staid here for four night at this B&B for a long weekend break. The B&B is situated in a pedestrianized street a ten minute walk from the historic centre; nearby caf\u00e9 Florio serves excellent coffee and aperitivi.The rooms are well-furnished, clean and modern, and have all the necessary facilities (airconditioning, wifi, tv, fridge). The manager, Marco, goes out of his way to help his guests and make them feel welcome. We had initially made a mistake with our booking, but he very kindly put us in a bigger room. Palermo is a real gem; looking forward to coming back some day!","6819":"My wife and I stayed here in early June, we loved the area of the B&B - so close to everything you want to see in Palermo. It is also close to the Segesta bus agency if you wish to take day trips and base yourself in Palermo. Breakfast was great - lots of variety, my favourite was the rosticceria & sweets from the pasticceria. The room was spacious, clean and very quiet at night. Marco was so helpful and happy to have a chat and give recommendations. We hope to return one day.","6845":"Stayed for one week. B&B Opera is in an ideal position, on a pedestrianised street, from which to explore Palermo. It is within easy walking distance of main attractions and bus stops. Breakfast is very nice (particularly the speck ham) and plentiful. Marco, the owner, is very attentive and friendly. He is very helpful in making recommendations for sightseeing and local eating. We will return to Palermo and definitely to Marco & B&B Opera. Great place to stay all round.","6883":"This was a wonderful B&B in the historic centre of Agrigento. It is a very beautiful traditional building, but very spacious B&B. The host, Adriana, is a wonderfully friendly, helpful and very cheerful person. The rooms are large and spotless (Room 1 is magnificent with a big double bed and two singles one of them behind a parting wall. Sofa, chairs, TV, wardrobe, drawers. Great shower room. The terrace though is a a real gem. It is large, with spectacular views of old Agrigento and the sea. Perfect for breakfast, which is varied including everything you would want - fresh fruits, yoghurts, meats, cheeses, various types of fresh crusty and soft rolls, filled croissants, cakes, biscuits, fruit juices, mineral water, various teas and of course excellent coffee. There is a code for free WIFi in the room. Contrary to other reviews, it is actually not that difficult to find from the main square of Agrigento and, while it is true by car GPS will take you to Via Atenea, at the BEGINNING of Via Fodera - but at the WRONG end, as Via Fodera is ONE WAY(Senso Unico), Adriana explains what entry road takes you there OR if you park in Via Atenea then phone her, she will COME THERE HERSELF and lead you! What more could you ask. They also have a FREE PRIVATE PARKING area about 30 metres from the front door! I think people need to realise that B&B's are almost NEVER staffed 24 7 so you do need to alert them to your approximate time of arrival to actually get in so they can arrange to be there. I found nothing 'average' about this B&B, especially for the money, facilities and internal character.","6913":"We were delighted with our visit to Il Giardino, and enjoyed excellent quality of the care from the staff. We stayed in January, and immediately felt at home in the communal sitting area with its cosy wood fire. This is where the family run hotel excels, with the owners caring about the decor, ambience and customer service  I look forward to visiting again  The hotel was originally the stable block for the Palazzo Conte Federico, a wonderful building located in the street behind, and which offers a fascinating glimpse into the history of Palermo","6915":"Apologies for the delay in reviewing il Giordano. I was in hospital for a week after our return for a serious operation. Staying at this place was so wonderful it helped to take my mind off the operation. The house is in a small street within walking distance of everything good to see, do or eat in the city. When you enter, you receive a warm welcome and realise what a peaceful beautiful haven you have discovered. Aurora was excellent at helping with directions or recommending places to go, especially the Palazzo right behind the property. The breakfasts were marvellous quality, examples of local baked goods and fruit. We have no hesitation in giving a maximum score to the house and would happily recommend staying there.","6924":"We loved this beautiful B and B. The location is terrific - within walking distance of the major sights and many restaurants. It is decorated with lovely pieces of art, sculpture...very fun! We would highly recommend this place!","6926":"Lovely friendly owners. Beautiful breakfast with lots of choices. Would certainly recommend.Plenty of restaurants within walking distance.:blush::wink: Close to cultural sites as well as shopping, cafes and bars.","6931":"We were stunned by the place, decorated with great pieces of art, also the kindness of the staff, the room was simply beautiful and the quality and variety of the breakfast were of great taste, not to mention the hot tub. I would say it has been our highlight of Palermo, we would love to come back again. Thank you so much for everything!","6932":"I traveled to Palermo with my family this past October for a trip around Sicily. Il Giardino di Ballaro was a beautiful B&B experience! It's located slightly off the main road but completely within a 5 minutes walk from restaurants bars touristy sites. The area also felt very safe, and even walking home on more than a few glasses of wine I felt fine as a female walking through the streets. Since it is a B&B there isn't a front desk attendant there at night but the managers were always available by text if we ever needed anything.  I really appreciated how quiet the rooms were at night, plus they had A C in every room which was a godsend in the hot, humid weather Sicily has to offer.  Breakfast was our favorite part! Every morning was an array of local sweets accompanied by fresh coffee and eggs (if you wanted...and of course you wanted) The staff was courteous and kind as we practiced our Italian with them. However, our favorite food-revelation by far was the pistachio spread that we smeared on our morning bread. Yum!  The hotel is tastefully decorated and pays homage to its former life as a bakery which I appreciated. The lobby always had the best music playing in the morning - a lovely intersection of calming jazz and house beats. If I had spoken better Italian I would have gotten their playlist off of them.  Overall I'd stay with them in Palermo again. Such a nice welcoming family, it was a wonderful introduction to Sicily!","6933":"We stayed here for 4 nights in September. It was an excellent choice. Location in the heart of the historic area is perfect. The welcome was excellent. The service was very good and the breakfast was also excellent. The room was comfortable and the a c kept it cool. Being in a very old building the window balcony was small and so the room was darker than a modern hotel but a small price to pay. We ate at the B&B\u2019s recommended restaurants \u2013 all just a short walk from the B&B. The area felt safe though one was aware of the run down nature of parts of Palermo.","6935":"We stayed three nights at Il Giardino di Ballaro and enjoyed it. The hotel is built on the site of a 5th century stable (!) and later a bakery, and some walls date to that period. Now, the hotel is clean and modern and quite. The breakfast room offers inside seating or a lovely outdoor terrace, which we enjoyed each day. The staff is friendly and helpful. The hotel is a short walk to the Via Maqueda and the four corners -- which is a pedestrian mall of restaurants, shops and bars. Quite the nighttime scene for people watching! Don't miss touring the Palace just behind the hotel, a 12th century palace still occupied by the family.","6938":"Staying in Il Giardino di Ballaro was like visiting family and friends :hearts:Aurora and Enrica were so very sweet, hospitable and helpful that we really felt like we are with family! Breakfast was always great-make sure you don\u2019t skip it! The place is unique, very beautiful and very well kept, not to mention super close to every historical landmark you want to visit. Would highly recommend it!","6948":"We enjoyed a beautiful stay recently at this fabulous B&B in the heart of the city. All the staff were very welcoming, helpful and friendly, and we appreciated the extra effort they went to accommodating our family of five. Thank you so much for a truly memorable stay.","6953":"Perfect location in the middle of the city center. Clean, spacious and comfortable rooms with good taste. The complete interior is very stylish. Staff is very friendly and helpful. We never felt unsave in the neighbourhood, it's full of charm. Breakfast is excellent with good coffee. Only one minor remark: it's an advantage that you can sit in the garden but we think that the garden could have more potential by adding some water (enough space for a small swimming pool) or green on the stone walls. Now, it looks just too simple and does not has the stylish look of the rest of the building. We will come back to this place!","6956":"Charming B&B at the convenient location with a interesting collection of art and ceramics and a garden. Great concierge and super friendly staff, they let us leave our luggage after check out and helped with parking directions. Nice room, clean and comfortable. Great coffee and breakfast!","6958":"What a charming and exceptional find this B&B is in central Palermo! The hotel is located close to the Duomo and is perfectly situated for walking the city of Palermo. The hotel is spotlessly clean and beautifully appointed. The hosts are incredibly helpful, assisting with airport cab rides, recommendations for restaurants and places to go in the city. Our rooms were perfect! The beds were comfortable, the showers hot and spacious - everything about Il Giardino made our stay in Palermo wonderful. Breakfast was abundant and they make cappuccino! I highly recommend Il Giardino di Ballaro if you plan to visit Palermo. The service and accommodations are excellent.","6959":"The staff ensured our stay was thoroughly enjoyable. Despite their inability to get our room TV to function with English speaking channels and the room refrigerator lacked functional performance; we liked its location.","6962":"My husband and two college age children stayed here for several nights in May. The rooms are unique and comfortable. The breakfasts are delicious and the location is convenient.  The garden in the middle of the hotel is really unusual -- so much so that when my daughter and I were returning to the hotel one afternoon, a little boy who was looking for his friend stopped and said, There's a garden in there, you know! I can see why he thought it was special.  The staff are very helpful, too. We very much enjoyed our stay!","6965":"We liked this B&B very much. The lobby and room is elegant and stylish. The breakfast was delicious and had lots of choices. The neighborhood was very cool and real with lots of authentic charm-especially in the market- and everything we wanted to see was within walking distance.","6967":"We had a wonderful stay at Il Giardino. We had a very nice suite with two rooms, two bathrooms and a comfortable bed. We also had access to the pretty outside garden courtyard. The breakfast was delicious with pastries, fruits and made to order eggs. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful with advice on where to go for seeing the sights and for a great restaurant for dinner, which was the best meal of our trip. The B&B was in close walking distance to the historic district. We had to cancel the second night of our stay after needing to reroute our flight home and they were very gracious and did not charge us a penalty. We would highly recommend Il Giardino di Ballaro.","6970":"My name is Karin Mallory. I bring very small groups of guests to Italy 4 - 5 times a year and am always on the look-out for the best hotel. I'd never been to Palermo before but was drawn to its gritty authenticity. There is no more authentic neighborhood than the Ballaro neighborhood. Located a stones throw from the Ballaro Food Market ... staying here at Il Giardino di Ballaro, we were right in the thick of it. Not for everyone .... but I absolutely loved it! Palermo is the most ethnically diverse city I have ever visited. Absolutely pulsating with energy. If you like Naples, Italy, you will really like Palermo. Fantastic architecture. Breath taking mosaics and churches. THE BEST street markets with THE BEST STREET FOOD. Men playing cards and hanging around. Lots of men. They whistle, but they were harmless. The hotel itself was a breathtaking oasis of sophisticated style. Everything about it was absolutely comfortable. And stunning. Indoor and outdoor areas to gather on really comfortable furniture. Beautiful books to look at. Really lovely art on the walls. Plants. A rooftop deck with available hot tub. Absolutely fantastic breakfasts. Kink, kind, kind staff who were friendly, warm, and eager to help with absolutely everything. I had been in contact long beforehand to see if they could recommend a driver to take us on a full day exploration to the other side of the island to see Greek Ruins, an incredible white cliff beach then a hike and dinner in a quiet mountaintop village. They found me the most incredible private driver (Gaetalo Palermo Taxi Driver) who I highly recommend. They also found me a private tour guide to give us a walking tour in Palermo who was also incredible. They arranged for pick up from the ferry when we arrived. Next time I come back I am going to have the lovely woman who made our breakfast each morning (I am sorry, I forgot your name!) teach us a cooking class in their beautiful kitchen! She offered and I look forward to.it. From first contact until the moment we left, we had an incredible stay. I'll stay whenever I bring guests to Palermo. --Karin Mallory Karin Mallory Presents: Italia","6975":"I stayed in Il Giardino di Ballaro in April 2019. I very much enjoyed my time there. Located just up from the Ballaro Food Market which looks quite daunting at first, but is a lively and friendly place, the B&B is also just around the corner from the Palace and the Cathedral, so it was extremely easy to walk everywhere.  We received a lovely welcome from Annalise and her team [Erica etc]. Our bedroom, The Madonna was very nice, simple but with individual decoration.  Breakfast is fantastic and different local dishes are served everyday.  I highly recommend this place and would stay again. Palmero is an amazing city full of treasures, and the people are very lovely and welcoming.","6994":"I can't say enough about this beautiful place. It's super clean, cozy, huge bedrooms and best of all....the owners are absolutely the gem of it all! They are super accommodating, very, very friendly and make sure you feel like you are family. The only issue I had was that we didn't stay longer. We will be back and stay here for sure. Don't hesitate to stay here, because the price is definitely worth it.","6995":"We spent a week at Il Giardino di Ballaro, having been recommended by a friend. It was a fantastic choice. The location is just a short walk from the centre of the old town and very close to the Ballaro market, Palazzo Dei Normanni, Palatine Chapel and the cathedral. Our room, named Maiolica, was spacious and came with the luxury of two en-suite bathrooms. There is so much to see in Palermo and the excellent breakfasts set us up well for the day ahead. As others have said, the hotel is a very peaceful and relaxing place to return to after a hard day\u2019s sightseeing. The staff were super friendly and helpful, recommending restaurants and advising on travel itineraries for our excursions out of town. They even sent us the recipes for their lovely cakes, which we look forward to recreating at home. Highly recommended.","6998":"Very charming boutique B&B, in the chaotic old town of Palermo. Wonderful decorated common area. Delicious breakfast. Staff very friendly, helpful. They gave us good recommendation for restaurants,hotels for our trip though Sicily. I would highly recommend!","7001":"My wife and I stayed here for two nights (Saturday and Sunday) and absolutely loved it. The hotel is a lovely oasis as soon as you step through the door but only a couple of minutes from the Palazzo Dei Normani and the Cathedral. Our room was lovely. A good size, comfortable and air conditioned and filled lots of interesting furnishings. The staff were fantastic. Extremely friendly and helpful. Recommending and booking restaurants, arranging taxis. The stuff my very basic Italian struggles with! Breakfast was also great. The only minor downside was loud music on both nights from outside the hotel but that\u2019s just the price for being in the heart of such a vibrant city. In short we couldn\u2019t recommend it highly enough.","7004":"We are still congratulating ourselves for finding this little gem in the midst of Palermo. Staff are professional, friendly, proactive and very attentive. The rooms are clean and comfortable and a good's night sleep was followed by a super breakfast with loads of choice. Highly recommended.","7006":"We were here for three days and the location was really good. The accommodation was spacious and clean and Stefano was really helpful, quickly replying to any messages we sent him. Breakfast was fine the downstairs room. There were some good bars and restaurants close by in the two squares. We would stay here again. About 15-20 minutes walk to the main sights.\r \r It was quite a walk from the car parking to the B&B along cobbled streets (6minutes with suitcases) and when we arrived our room was on the 2nd floor. Lots of stairs. Not a problem for us but maybe for some people. Car parking was \u20ac15 a day and a little awkward to find through a gateway on a residential street. Even in early June we didn\u2019t have daytime access to a roof terrace or lounge or concierge (see property description) Maybe this was too early in the season and not busy enough.","7011":"This B&B gets everything right - comfortable rooms, excellent breakfasts, refreshing peace and quiet in the middle of the bustle and excitement of Palermo. What really sets it apart is the warmth of the welcome from the hosts, their concern to help their guests in every possible way, and the impeccable service given by all the staff. We recommend the experience to everyone.","7019":"This build was built 800 years ago by the family who are living there now. It was barn, bakery and who knows that saw in the past. If you stay here you will feel this atmosphere. Wonderful! The staff is professional, rooms are very very nice. If I am going to Palermo again and if I have chance I will stay here again. Congratulations for the family and hotel staff!","7028":"My wife and I stayed at this B&B for 2 nights in early June. Charming B&B on a charming street very close all the important points of interest. We enjoyed walking in the area. The bus from the airport stops on Via Roma and then a short walk to the B&B. Stefano is a wonderful host. The room was very clean and the breakfast one of the best we had in Sicily. Highly recommend. All of the B&B's we stayed at were at this price point.","7034":"Al piazza Marina B&B is located in the historic city center. Living in this B&B you feel allready part of the history as the building is constructed in he 16th century! The owner, Stefano, is very friendly as the rest of the personel. Tip: In 3 min. walk (in via Alloro) there is a bus stop for the free, city center small bus.","7045":"We\u2019re just coming to the end of a short stay (2 nights) and it\u2019s been brilliant. Amidst the rough and tumble of the area (which we\u2019ve loved) this was a peaceful oasis. The lobby area is a lovely cool calm and modern blend of historic and modern. The gardens at the back are lovely for breakfast. We had the garden room at the back which was quiet and ideal for a family of 4 (two kids aged 12 and 9). Good breakfast. And beat of all the staff have been amazing with nothing too much trouble. Great value, fab location. Definitely recommend.","7050":"Il Giardino di Ballaro` is a quiet oasis of calm and comfort tucked away on a small street near the Ballaro` market and within a short walk of many of the important historic sights in Palermo. The area around the hotel is alive with activity but once you enter the hotel, it\u2019s peaceful and quiet. The lobby was once part of a stable then a bakery and has lots of architectural character. The rooms are attractively furnished and very comfortable and the bathrooms are modern and attractive. Breakfast was delicious and can be taken in either of two lovely courtyards. The staff were lovely, kind and helpful. The owner\u2019s daughter was especially nice and provided recommendations with restaurants. I suggest that you let the hotel help with transportation. They have drivers with very comfortable cars. If returning to the hotel late at night, definitely take a taxi. The market can be a little rowdy after dark! I highly recommend staying at Il Giardino di Ballaro`!","7051":"On the way back of Vale dei Tempi Agrigento we slept at this cute hotel. Staff was very nice, the owners very simpatic, delicious pizza margherita and wonderful breakfast with prosciutto crudo, high quality of cheese, bread, canoli and other sweets. Very good latte macchiato and espresso too. Air conditioner worked pretty well, shower was big, very good, bed confortable. Free parking in front of the hotel. Everything we expected for a good hotel :ok_hand:","7053":"3 of stayed here in 2 rooms for 2 nights. The drive to find the place was a bit harrowing - potholes and narrow and winding, but it was all worth it. The staff were absolutely outstanding! This is surely the most friendly accommodation in all of Italy, with smiling, welcoming, helpful staff. Our rooms were good and both had reasonable sized terraces. The pool was lovely and sparkling clean, as were our rooms. The views were great - all the way out to the sea. We ate dinner in the restaurant both nights and breakfast both mornings and each time we were very happy with the quality of the food. (Although the first night we had some communication issues and as a result each of us ended up with 3 courses, all of which were massive and which we couldn't possibly eat, even though it was lovely. The next night we were more careful with our orders). And it was all for a very fair price. This B&B (small hotel really) is one of the best places I've ever stayed for value and comfort and friendliness. It gets top marks! Be aware that you need a car to get here and that it's quite remote.","7056":"So I think I made the sign of the cross over a hundred times driving here. You go through tiny narrow streets with cross streets and peoples houses and oncoming cars. The view at this place is great and the staff nice and friendly. Room was clean and comfortable. Lift went to the third floor but had to drag luggage down some stairs (lift stops in between floors and moves at a snails pace). The bathroom has liquid soap and a hair dryer (bring your own shower cap). Breakfast was a variety of fruit, cold meat, cheese, pastry, cannoli, cereal and yoghurt to name a few. Pool looks great at night! Free parking available outside the gate on the street. Wifi and air conditioner worked well and there is a mini bar! Overall nice place!","7059":"The main sights are within walking distance. The vibrant Ballaro market starts at the bottom of the road, yet a couple of hundred metres up the road at il Giardino it is surprisingly quiet. We were warmly welcomed with fruit juice and cakes on arrival. All of the staff were friendly and helpful. They gave us a list of local restaurants and were happy to make reservations for us. Make sure that you try out Pizzottando and Villa San Giovanni deli Eremiti. Breakfasts were excellent and included something special each day, either cake or ice-cream - it's the first time I've had ice-cream for breakfast but I thoroughly recommend it! Good sized bedroom and bathroom. Our room looked out onto a small narrow side street rather than via Porta di Castro which meant that it was a bit quieter, although not as bright. There is also plenty of space downstairs to relax, either inside - which might be useful if you got a wet day - or in the outdoor courtyard.","7063":"I chose this place based on the reviews here, I was not disappointed. From the outside it does not look great but once inside it is excellent. They arranged a discounted taxi transfer from the airport and on arrival gave us coffee and some traditional Sicilian cakes. Staff were excellent and incredibly helpful and friendly. Be aware though that there is no lift, and you may have to carry a suitcase up around 20 stairs. Breakfast was typical continental style, and served in or outside, there is also a lovely roof terrace to relax on. I thought being close to the historical centre it would be moist at night but it was fine. Although we had heard it could be rough at night, we always felt safe coming back from eating out. Like any big city there are probably places to avoid but this wasn\u2019t one of them. A great place to stay.","7070":"We travelled to Sicily with 33 people and stayed at B&B Montemare. The location is remote and set in the mountains, and the view is EXQUISITE. We rented vans & cars, which were necessary to travel to and from the B&B. The B&B rooms were spotless and very pretty, the restaurant served delicious food (we ate breakfast and dinner there several times), and the staff treated us like family. Enza and Miguel were particularly kind and accommodating, and we won't soon forget them. In a word, OUTSTANDING.","7072":"The property exceeded my expectations - their breakfast room is simply amazing with music in the background, very beautiful details (Ramona the owner is an artist herself with very good taste in decorating and making you feel cozy and comfortable). The entire hotel smells so so good - they use a perfume it's amazing how much care they take of the place. Delicious breakfast - with everything that your heart desires (prosciutto, mozzarella, cheese, fresh tomatoes, fresh bread, fresh pineapple & orange juice, fresh-cut fruits, yogurt, muesli, almonds, lots of sweets - mini cannoli so so lovely, brioche, cake, biscuits, pistachio cream etc). Very clean and comfortable rooms, nice decorated. Hotel just around the corner from the main street - also 24 7 carrefour near and 101 bus station - the bus that has en route the central station, also airport bus near.","7082":"A very comfortable B&B. The decor is gorgeous and the excellent staff. Located is a lovely area and an easy work into the old area. Breakfast was excellent. Supermarket around the corner. Will stay again.","7084":"first of all the location is fantastic: far a bit from the historical part( but easily walkable) but in a really nice area the rooms are pretty the team taking care of this is fantastic: taking care of details++ they have a list of local restaurants which they tried and liked breakfast is nice, delicate , good quality an price quite reasonable for what is is a real hotel boutique B&B!","7091":"Really gorgeous B&B with classy decor, very comfortable beds,lovely linen, well appointed bathrooms and spotlessly clean. The owner (who spoke English) was so charming and helpful and served a delicious breakfast of fresh fruit, cereals, nuts and grains, pastries, cakes etc a really wonderful selection. We were only in Palermo for one night. We liked the location too which was near Teatro Garibaldi and a nice area to walk day or night. Would have liked some more time to browse the local clothes shops! The airport bus stop is only a five minute walk; we made the mistake of taking the train from the airport which left us further away. If I was going to Palermo again I would definitly book in here.","7101":"Where to start it says 4star obviously Italy has a different rating very very noisy outside woken up a couple of times at silly hours fridge was more like a heater said it would be fixed following day but wasn't and the shower was probably the smallest I've ever used nice Square handles on the inside which dig in quite nicely","7104":"Our room looked exactly the same as on the pictures, the breakfast was good, although it was a shame, that in Italy a hotel makes that kind of watery coffe (swill), which didn't looked like real coffe nor tasted like that. The sheets were clean but we needed the thermo blankets which were definintely not clean (they smelled). The bathroom was large, but the shower cabin was so small, that my fianc\u00e9 could't fit in. Otherwise the staff was kind and helpful they gave us another room with a spacios shower cabin. It would be nice if there would be a kettle in the room to make a tea or coffe.\r BUT if you choose this hotel, take it into account that on Friday and Saturday there's party time around the building which makes impossible to sleep from 10PM till 2:30AM and the streets which lead to the hotel are messy and smell from p*ss and sh*t and next to the hotel there begins the slum part of the city. The hotel writes that they have soundproof windows and walls but take my word: next to a pub and and a roaring street music the windows and the walls mean zero.\r So from Sunday to Friday I recommend the hotel (despite the location) because its a good deal, but if you want to relax, don't come here on the weekend.","7106":"Room was nice. Bathroom clean and modern. Staff were very very helpful and friendly. But... we were here friday and saturday. These days are horroristic in this area. In front of the hotel from 4 cars come a different loud music. In 4th floor the Windows are nearly to break. The windows are not sound proof. And finally the policeman the end of 112 line doesnt speak English. And the hotel staff said that the police cannot do nothing because of the law.\r So this place is a bad joke!!!\r \r I DON\u2019T RECOMMEND FROM FRIDAY TILL SUNDAY IF YOU WANT TO SLEEP AT NIGHT AFTER A LONG DAY!!!","7110":"Very nice stay in this b&b. A beautifull room with a view. Nice and clean. All what you need, with a very helpfull manager The restaurant was also very good. Nice & honest sicilian food at a good price with good and friendly service. Thanks to Enza, the manager and the staff A recommended b&b. We will come back when we are in the neighborghood or recommend it to our friends","7116":"The B&B is beautiful, with large and comfortable rooms, and centrally located, within walking distance of the main touristic attractions of Palermo. Breakfast was also wonderful! I certainly recommend!","7122":"B&B is located on the second floor with about 8 ensuite, individually styled bedrooms. It has a nice light and airy feel Pretty easy to find. Safe area. NB get specific directions for off street parking. Also if you are arriving late make arrangements with the owner as we found 2 guests out on the street with no way of getting in except for us turning up - I think this was around 9pm. We had the theatre room which was lovely. Breakfast was good. Great shopping nearby. The old town is a bit of a walk 20 mins plus - some people will like this, others not.","7123":"This is a tired dirty hotel in a tired dirty part of town. I was booked in as part of a tour or I would have backed out the door pronto. I echo the disparaging comments from other reviewers. It is noisy and unclean. The elevator doesn\u2019t work. The staff are friendly and wish to be helpful but seemingly lack the resources to fix, clean or attend to the basics of hostelry.","7126":"Great place to stay with breathtaking views toward to west coast and Agrigento. Michele and his brother, Piero, were outstanding hosts; both accommodating and friendly above and beyond. The small village below, Giardina Gallotti, does not have much in the way of amenities but has a beautiful pizzeria, Trattoria Da Mimmo, with great value dining and as an alternative to the onsite restaurant at the Montemare B&B. A good place to stay if you want to visit the valley of the temples (Valle dei Templi) and avoid the dustbin that is Agrigento (and I say this because the place is littered with piles of festering rubbish strewn everywhere)","7129":"The B&B is a fantastic refurbished. Old style apartment building, in central Palermo. The rooms is spacious with very nice bathroom, and with a espresso machine. The breakfast is amazing . Nice ice cream pistachio to start the day :)","7151":"I want to thank the staff for quality service. The hotel is very beautiful and cozy. Nice location of the hotel and pleasant atmosphere. I'd like to visit again. I recommend like hotel for good vacation","7153":"One night in Palermo. Room on 6th floor [of 8].\r Friendly staff, rooms clean and up to standard.\r But noisy!! Only stayed for one night, so not sure how it is on other nights. But on Saturday night, the neighbourhood is one big party. And you are part of it till 5 am!!\r When out on the street on Sunday morning, streets are dirty and look a garbage belt which give an overall unsafe and unpleasant feeling.\r \r If possible, ask for a room at the back side.","7161":"We paid about \u00a365 a night for this hotel and it was perfect at the price. The location is convenient. The rooms are exactly what you\u2019d expect at that price and the breakfast was totally fine. It\u2019s a bit noisy outside but ... you\u2019re in Italy. That\u2019s how they roll. They like to chat into the night. If you want quiet and no people having fun - go elsewhere. Probably not a Sicilian city!","7167":"The hotel is located in a loud neighborhood and not as central as we wished. The reception people were friendly. The car was parked by a hotel employee in a save area (we paid around 13\u20ac for 1 night). The room and the bath were small but clean. The breakfast buffet was complete. I would recommend to have check the distances from the spots you plan to visit.","7178":"This hotel is well situated for seeing Palermo. The rooms are comfortable, quiet and well serviced. Beds are comfortable and linens are in good condition. Breakfast choices are varied with fresh fruit options daily. Staff seem friendly and helpful.","7182":"The staff are amazingly nice and accommodating. The room was cleaned each day and the shower was hot. And it was in a great location. It even was near a bus stop for free buses that travel around the city. Just lovely. I would have given it more but you can\u2019t control your own ac heat","7189":"The staff is unprofessional, granny and rude. The rooms are way too expensive for what they offer. Not even a glass of water comes with the room. The breakfast is cheap and rushed. The shower is cold and small. I don\u2019t understand how they get any good reviews... they must be fake. I was very happy to leave the day after, waste of money and time.","7199":"We spent two nights. It was a very clean hotel with a very pleasant staff. The room is good size although best to ask for a room not facing the narrow street you enter through. Shower was odd in that it varies from hot to cold and back again along with varying the amount of flow from high to low. We told the staff but nothing changed. Perhaps it was just a peculiarly of room 208. Very reasonably priced, and we left Sunday morning and the hotel was fully booked for that night and through Christmas and New Year\u2019s.","7210":"The hotel is very good . Great service and clean . The room is wide and the breakfast has everything, which is rare in Italy . There is no parking dedicated but you may find a place around as we found too . The spot is good as it\u2019s close to the port and at the beginning of the main commercial street . So convenient for a walk. There was nothing negative to mention . So I suggest it for a city break . Also the price was very good for the winter period we visited","7211":"The hotel is situated on a narrow street and has a lot of street noise during the day due to some building work opposite. This isn't a problem at night, a comfortable sleep in a comfortable bed. We stayed 4 nights and ate in the restaurant on the top floor nightly. Paolo was an excellent host and his mother is a fantastic cook, cannot recommend the food enough, so fresh and tasty. Breakfast has just enough variety and everything was fresh. The room was very clean, the staff polite and helpful.","7214":"This is an extremely convenient and friendly hotel located close to many attractions and good restaurants. The rooms are very clean, quite roomy and very comfortable and the hotel staff are very friendly and helpful. The beds were very comfortable and staff brought us extra pillows only a few minutes after we asked. Wifi was good.  The breakfast was excellent with a good variety of food and with some new pastries and fruit every day so you won\u2019t get bored with it if you have a long stay. The breakfast is served on the rooftop with a nice view and comfortable decor. We found having a wine at this rooftop area a nice way to end a busy day of exploring the area.  If you have a car, free parking is only a block away. We will definitely stay again when we visit beautiful Sicily again.","7218":"Wonderful place to stay close to historic district with amazing breakfast cakes all made in house by the chef Lovely rooms and easy to walk around the city. Very helpful staff. 10 minute walk from the train station.","7219":"The family running this B&B could not be more helpful. Our room was on the small side but was very comfortable, with a lovely shower room and a balcony with the most amazing views across the hills to the sea. Free wifi. Easy parking right outside the B&B, good breakfasts and a restaurant serving very good value food. There is a beautiful outdoor pool too, which also has wonderful views. We found this B&B not only convenient for the Valley of the Temples but for the coast too. Everything was spotlessly clean and the staff were brilliant. Only down side was that we experienced a bit of noise from the people in the next room to us, when they were on their balcony. That didn't stop us enjoying this brilliant place though. We really enjoyed discovering the surrounding countryside and the beautiful coastline. The B&B was a very reasonable price too. We would definitely go back.","7222":"The staff here were excellent. Nothing seemed to be too much trouble. We had a large room with plenty of space and room for clothes, but the bathroom needed updating. The mastic around the bath looked pretty old and didn't convey a great message, Good location in the old part of town so it was an easy walk everywhere. The external noise throughout the night was loud, but to be honest, its probably much the same in any of the hotels in Palermo. Overall it was very pleasant but it didn't give the 'wow factor.","7223":"Overall we really enjoyed our stay at Porta Felice. Someone had previously mentioned our room number for experiencing noise from the restaurant above and road outside - however we did not find this at all and got a great, quiet night's sleep while being in busy Palermo! We found the location brilliant - being by the seafront wasn't the main draw as we thought it might be, as there's not much along here. However the hotel is located in an up-and-coming area in the old town which we really liked - it's very quiet in the area immediately around the hotel but just 5 minutes walk finds you at some lively, buzzy areas with great restaurants and bars (try Ballarak Magione - a really cool brewery bar!) and just a 15 minute walk from the centre. We found it fine to walk back at night.  We tried the hotel's spa for the 'wellness trail' which is essentially an hour of using the spa facilities (jacuzzi, sauna, steam room) which was nice to do in the evening before we went out for dinner. Our room was big and comfortable with Sky TV - we feel the only things that let this hotel down for us was our bathroom, which either needs renovating or a very good deep clean as there was quite a lot of black mould around the bath (the rest of the room was lovely and clean so this let it down) and also the aircon facility - basically you have to ask for this to be switched on every single day and it's switched off sometime mid-morning. I understand it's a waste for it to be on if people aren't in the room but surely there could be a better system than always having to ask - I think the keycards show if someone is in the room or not so perhaps continue to switch off the ac mid-morning but if the room is occupied, allow guests to have the ability to switch the ac on themselves - just a suggestion!  The breakfast was great. As a small hotel with only around 30 rooms I believe, it wasn't a huge selection but everything there was delicious - especially the freshly baked cakes sweet selection each morning.  A couple of tweaks would, in my opinion, upgrade this hotel from being great to being excellent. I'd definitely stay again regardless.","7227":"Booked a room way back in June for a four night stay that September. Actually travelling on train to Palermo late September when they cancelled! Over booked! - and we were not the only people refused their booked accommodation. NO assistance offered or given. Therefore cannot in any way recommend. Indeed suggest that you avoid this hotel at all costs!! We really were lucky and managed to find Airbnb apartment. There were few if any hotel beds available in Palermo that night. No idea what happened to others who were refused. NO apology. NO assistance. Our travel agent tells us they have now 'black listed' this hotel Do the same!! See that they has happen to others before. Very poor.","7229":"We had two visits to the Porta felice and on our first visit ,we were on the first floor facing the road the hotel entrance is on It\u2019s really noisy in early evenings and first thing in the morning when deliveries are made I requested a rear room for our 2nd visit and were give a room with a disabled toilet when we aren\u2019t disabled The noise problem can be solved with double glazed windows . The reception staff are rather grumpy and not very helpful, breakfast staff are very friendly and helpful. As you can see our second room was not well maintained","7232":"The hotel was in an ideal location for attractions and restaurants.The room was spacious and clean with a very comfortable bed and pillows. The staff were friendly and helpful.Antonino in the bar was great. The food in the restaurant was reasonably priced and good quality as was breakfast although limited selection.","7239":"Having read some of the reviews I went with some trepidation, but gotta say the hotel was more than fine, breakfast plentiful, staff fabulous and only too pleased to assist with any enquiries, the area it's situated in is on the doorstep of the centre of the city and everywhere is in walking distance,it's very lively outside the hotel especially weekends when all the local young people gather, chatting and listening to loud music but to me that added authenticity to the trip,never felt intimidated as some have said and really enjoyed it, so to sum up, forget what you've heard it's fabulous, and that's from two 60year old lol","7241":"Thank you so much for such an amazing stay. Our room was lovely and a welcome sight after 30 hours of travel. Breakfast each morning was great, we especially loved the home-baked treats that were available each morning. The ricotta cheesecake, pistachio tart and cannoli were just divine! As for dinner, we cannot thank you all enough for making our nights so memorable. Antonio, Chris and Paulo were brilliant hosts, always up for a chat and their recommendations of places to visit helped make our holiday even more special. It was as thought we were visiting friends each night and we'll forever remember what an amazing stay we had. So thank you! We absolutely loved the location, which is an easy 5 minute walk to the restaurants, caf\u00e9s, shopping and all the historic charm that is Palermo. So thank you for such an amazing holiday and we can't wait to return in the very near future.","7246":"The setting is in an old part of Palermo and it is very noisy especially at night ... lots of loud music, barking dogs. The streets are littered in trash so it does not make the hotel very appealing. Our room had no square walls so furniture placement was difficult ... if you had to get up in the night - you had to be very careful that you did not bump into the bed .. other furniture etc. Breakfast was okay but we had three dinners that were not great. They had to bring the food in from either another hotel or a caterer and it was not hot. The staff were hard working and willing to please but the hotel does not look like the photo that is shown .... the lobby is right on the street and there are no pools.","7248":"Hotel Porta Felice is a good base for a weekend in Palermo, reasonably priced and in a good location.  Our issues were minor but annoying, reception can over-ride the air conditioning in the room and would switch it off after breakfast. The toiletries in the room were never replenished and you didn't get a hand towel. Some staff were better than others and breakfast was disappointing.  If we returned to Palermo (which is unlikely) then I wouldn't automatically stay here again, we would look at alternatives, although depending on your budget and expectations it would suffice. Try and get a room at the back of the hotel, there are renovation works going on across the road and with refuse collections and deliveries, it can be noisy early in the morning.  This is a 3 star hotel with a spa, which we didn't use.","7252":"It is definitely not a 4 star hotel. The area is noisy, the streets are littered with garbage and broken beer bottles. The meals are brought in from a sister hotel so are not hot. The staff do an excellent job, they are friendly and work hard to solve any problems. I would not stay here in the future.","7257":"I have stayed many times at Hotel Porta Felice, manageress Daniela along with the staff are always welcoming and helpful. Rooms are lovely , very comfortable with all facilities , overflowing buffet breakfast, Just love staying there.","7259":"We stayed here for 5 nights and had to move rooms. Room 306 is under the restaurant on the top floor which will keep you awake until late at night and wake you up early as you can hear chairs moving, plates clattering and all the goings on in the kitchen. So we were moved to room 106 which had no air conditioning - you can\u2019t control it - we had to ask for it to be turned on at reception! We realised why it wasn\u2019t turned on - the awful smell. There is obviously something dead up in the vent which they need to sort out. Then the plug in the shower is stuck so you are standing in a pool of water - we had to get them to fix this. You can\u2019t use the spa unless you pay so the whole idea of staying in a spa hotel is totally misleading as all other hotels let guests use the facilities, unless they want a treatment.  Wi-Fi Doesn\u2019t work so had to pay for data on my phone the entire stay. At reception they seemed to respond that there is a technician on the way but after reading other reviews this is nonsense - they have had this issue for some time and haven\u2019t bothered to resolve it.  Breakfast Breakfast selection is okay but with the balcony doors open flies are over all the food and die in the fruit selection.  Noise Both rooms at the front of the hotel had noise from the street throughout the night - cars, bottle pick ups which kept us awake.  Overall we didn\u2019t have a good experience here. The basics of a good nights sleep, breakfast and being able to shower in comfort is not met and at the price is totally unacceptable. This is not a 4 star hotel and I would urge you not to be drawn in by the allure of a \u2018spa hotel\u2019. Complacent and totally need to address all these issues. I WISH we had read the reviews before we booked.","7265":"Excellent staff. Great room (106) a lot bigger than I expected. Air con excellent after a day out, stayed 4 days. Breakfast excellent, English options as well. Nice terrace at breakfast. Set on a quite road ,mostly, building work opposite from early so was noisy and refuse collections early so noisy at times but, that\u2019s life, I like to wake up early to enjoy a longer day, moaners on this forum ... your life at home must be perfect... no noise at anytime ? Mom. Thanks Felice and Spa ... loved my stay ... will highly recommend . Michael and family from Liverpool","7269":"In short: A good location helps make this hotel a relative oasis in the turmoil that is Palermo. Although not new, the accommodation was well maintained and very pleasant (in a very Euro sort of way). Measured in the key categories* the Porta Felice scores a very respectable 4.5 average.  The long story: The Hotel Porta Felice is located within relatively easy walking distance of the city centre, but far enough away to give it a degree of separation from the hustle and bustle of the city. It's also one street back from the extremely busy main arterial (SS113) that runs along the waterfront and the hotel benefits from the acoustic defilade that this block of buildings provides. You still get some vehicular noise, but it's going to be about as good as you'll get in the city that is seriously overwhelmed by its traffic. Just be aware of the parking scenario if you are bringing along your own car  Our room was very large, very comfortable and very well maintained and serviced; it was a delight. The air conditioning was effective and this was important in a city that can be extremely hot and humid. Sleep quality was good.  Breakfast is served on the top floor, with an option of either inside (in the blessed A C) or outside on the sunny balcony. Although the view is away from the coast and over the city it is still interesting and engaging. The breakfast options and quality were first class; absolutely no issues.  The staff was very helpful and pleasant, and they were keen to assist when requested. All good.  The acid test (that is, would I return): yes, definitely.  *Key Categories Accommodation = comfort, ambiance, sleep quality, facilities: 4.5 Breakfast Dining = quality, choice, appropriateness: 4.5 Staff = helpfulness, efficiency, politeness: 4.5 Meeting Expectations = how close to meeting the expectations they set: 4.5 Value-for-Money = taking everything into consideration and measuring this against the cost: 4.5","7272":"Stayed here for two nights, had room on first floor, facing the road on a Monday & Tuesday night. The hotel was very clean and staff were very helpful however, the hotel smelled damp which wasn't very pleasant. The breakfast on the top floor was lovely and there was an extensive breakfast supply and selection. There was a lovely view from the top. The hotel is set in a very handy place beside the port and close to a lot of the tourist attractions in the city. We also found a tiny beach close by to sit on when it was too hot to walk in the city which was lovely. The glass bottle recycling was collected on the road at 1am Monday night and the noise was terrible for over half an hour with smashing glass and truck versing noise & flashing lights. I complained about the noise and I said I hope it would be different the next night but it wasn't as the other bins were collected on the next night at the same time with the same level of noise. Overall there was quite significant noise in the area with bin collections and building working starting early across the road. Finally I was a bit disappointed that there was an additional charge to enter the spa when we were resident, so we didn't use it, also it appeared to be empty!","7278":"The hotel is a little off the center, but we actually liked that as the neighborhood looked more like what people in Palermo live. The hotel staff was helpful. We had an issue with breakfast not provided, but I believe this was a problem of the booking site rather than the hotel. The room was OK - a bit dated, but taken care about and clean. The problem is that the walls and windows are a very badly sound insulated so you hear everything from what happens next door or in the noisy square beyond. We had windows in opposite direction, so it was bearable but think of this when you book. All in all the experience was not bad.","7280":"It's been a while since I posted a review but this place really earned it. Great rooms (clean, comfortable and modern), great location (with parking) but the hosts are why I'm posting. Best people! This is a must place - trust me.","7299":"Nice hotel in walking distance to all main attractions. Good breakfast on rooftop. I can recommend hotel for Tourist stay. There are very nice restaurants close by. Palermo is definitly worth a visit.","7303":"Porta Felice Hotel is situated in the old town of Palermo - a five minute walk from the main thoroughfare area. Staff speak excellent English and are helpful and polite. The room was very spacious - a suite - divided into a sitting area with a settee and a desk and TV with wardrobes. Also it had a spacious sleeping area with lots of storage space . The bathroom was very big and equipped with a hairdryer and toiletries. Suggestions for improvements in the room would be to have more lighting as it was only lit by side lights making it quite dim. There was no coffee  tea making facilities in the room. The breakfast buffet selection was excellent with a good choice of things to eat and a view to the hills . Evening meals were delicious too. The spa facility is very tranquil and relaxing.","7320":"Yes, this is a very nice hotel. The room is very comfortable. We booked a four night deal through Luxury Escapes. Breakfast was okay, pretty much what you get in any good hotel in Italy. Our deal included dinners and I was not overly impressed with the quality of food on offer for them. The choices seemed to be the cheapest food available here. The seafood here is abundant and fresh but I felt the dishes we were served were not the optimal way to prepare the local seafood. The front office staff could be better informed about tourism. We asked about the hop on hop off bus and they told us we needed to get onboard at Politeama a good 40 minute walk from the hotel while we could have picked it up at Palazzo Steri, about 4 minutes walk from the hotel. All in all a bit disappointing.","7332":"Centrally located and easy to walk to attractions and restaurants. Rooms pleasant n loved the shampoo etc. Also has a Spa but did not use it. Breakfast had the tastiest made in house baked goods. The pistachio tart! Also provided a healthy variety of foods at breakfast. Staff very attentive. Dinner was overpriced but very good. Would definitely stay there again.","7344":"this was our favorite hotel on our trip. wood floors, no stinky carpet. a nice but simple restaurant offered good food at reasonable prices (owner was paolo- cool guy). great views from their balcony. they had a spa in the hotel, location was good, front desk helpful.","7353":"We stay there 4 nights with all the family. Rooms are very clean and quite large. For winter time, there is might a lack of light since the building configuration doesn\u2019t allow large windows. Location is quite convenient and for those who don\u2019t like walking there is a City free shuttle bus at 100 m from the hotel departing every 20 minutes. Breakfast is Good","7363":"This hotel is near the historic Felice gate. Great access to do many important sites in Palermo. We walked to all of the places and restaurants in our itinerary. Add a beautiful breakfast and I found this hotel exceeded my expectations.","7376":"We stayed at Hotel Porta Felice on a package purchased from Luxury Escapes Australia. Luxury Escapes sources hotels, resorts, cruises etc world wide and put together a great package. We trust them with all their selection and saves us a lot of time researching. Our stay at Porta Felice was wonderful. There are no coffee or tea making facilities in the room nor do they provide you with an iron. The staff are friendly, professional and helpful. The rooms are large and very clean. The spa was very enjoyable. Our package included 7 days accommodation with daily breakfast and three course dinner. Also included was a spa treatment.  The highlight for us was most definitely the evening dinner on the terrace rooftop. The Menu was exceptional and we looked forward every night to our selection. This restaurant most definitely gets 5 stars. It is run by Paolo and you will find his mum in the kitchen and his dad reading the paper every evening. The waiting staff are very professional and helpful. It was truly a great gastronomic experience every night. The prices are very affordable. Menu items start at 5 Euros for all desserts with main meals from 10 to 16 Euros. You can\u2019t get better than that! This restaurant is definitely a must whether you are staying at the hotel or visiting Palermo. In fact most customers were not guest at the hotel so that to me says it all.  Attached are picture of Paolo (in the middle) with the efficient waiter and of course the Chef. The other picture shows Paolo\u2019s mum and dad sitting at a table.","7394":"Excelent choice . Next to Massimo theatre and walking distance to main sites .The windows are sound proof and we don't hear the outside noise . New , modern, comfortable . Spacious room with Nespresso machine and Sky TV. Very tasty breakfast served in the dining room overlooking the Opera House. Airport pick-up available( for a fee ) . Thank you , Giacomo and Stefania ! It would be a pleasure to stay at Palco again.","7398":"We a group of 16 Irish ( Ennis wine club ) stayed for 2 nights in October. Location could not be better , right in the pedestrianed centre of Palermo so no taxis required to see the major sites. Accomodation on 2nd floor with lift access. All rooms amazing and all with different design features. Very modern design. Professional multilingual staff . Breakfast room overlooks the Opera house and the breakfast choice is fabulous, superior to the usual Italian breakfasts. Great coffee choices. As this is a small boutique hotel in the perfect location book it now or you will be disappointed when you come back later to book and rooms are not available,. Thank you Giacomo and Stefania ( owners), another Stefania ( manager ) for making our visit so memorable. If you are visiting or performing at Teatro Massimo look no further.","7402":"We stayed for 4 nights in the Opera room which has the most amazing view of the Opera house. The apartments are spotless & we enjoyed our stay here. Stephania was so helpful & booked some great restaurants for us. We would definitely return.","7407":"Palco Rooms and Suites is located in the heart of central Palermo, on an upper floor of a Palazzo overlooking the Teatro Massimo. It is a superb location for exploring Palermo. The owners Giacomo and Stefania run a slick establishment. All of the staff are warm and friendly, ensure you are taken care of, and help with advice if needed. The breakfast is excellent with good variety every morning. The place is decorated in a cool white theme with splashes of colour. The rooms are comfortable and impeccably maintained. Overall we highly recommend Palco. Thanks again for making us feel welcome and for helping to ensure we had a great time in Palermo.","7409":"The location is perfect, beautiful views of Massimo Theatre from breakfast room simply breath-taking. Agree with all other reviewers that this is a 5* gem, everything is chic and modern whilst still complimenting the beauty of the old building. One of the best places we have ever stayed in and we are considerably well travelled. The staff were terrific and couldn't have been more helpful, upgrade to a suite was the icing on the cake.","7413":"Parking is property inside garage.and room is big, clean, location is just 5 minutes from sightseeing places, hospitality with this cost. I was checked in late, but nothing problem. Very enjoyable place to stay.","7414":"Only a 5 minute drive to the Valley of the Temples or 10 minutes into Agrigento centro, this is a really nice B&B. Spacious, clean, delicious breakfast and wonderful hosts. Our only regret is that we didn't get to spend more time there as we were on a quick visit to this area. We had a wonderful breakfast out on the terrace and felt right at home!","7415":"This is a beautiful renovated hostel which is located in an antique building and very easy to access. The rooms are spacious, definitely clean and cozy. The location of the hostel is very near to the city centre, pier and other attractions - just walking distance away. Particularly, we love thier breakfast which is lovely with plenty of choices. Unforgetably, their staff particularly Stefania is very helpful and nice. No matter what we need - arrangement of early breakfast and the delivery of luggages, they would provide the top-rated service to us. We love this hostel and shall stay again when we visit Palermo, Sicily next time.","7417":"We have been here for 4 days and it was an excellent place. Starting with the privilege of a great view (it\u2019s situated across Teatro Massimo), the location offers also the possibility to stay in the middle of old city center (restaurants, shops, night life, etc). We had Romeo and Juliet apartment, exactly like in the presentation pictures. Absolutely 5 stars for cleaning and tidying (they arranged my clothes every day!). Staff is extremely friendly (Stefan and Stefania), very willing to help you (when leaving, due to exchange rate, they didn\u2019t charge breakfast anymore). Also, Hermes hygienic products, great quality; breakfast incredibly tasty, various fruits every morning and fresh pasticeria. Although I\u2019ve seen some reviews about the staires, believe me, it\u2019s exagerate to say you don\u2019t have place to go up or down the staires (maybe if you don\u2019t get any minus in location, you have to find something), I went down the staires with 2 luggeges in my left and right hand any didn\u2019t have any problem. All in all, I recomend this place, 5 stars from me!","7421":"Don\u2019t let the \u201cthree star\u201d assessment throw you. This small, chic, and vibrantly eclectic place is a five star gem, hands down. We stayed in the Romeo & Juliet Suite. Beautiful views of the famous Opera House and by simply heading downstairs, instant access to the shops, bars and restaurants of both old and new Palermo. Will definitely stay here again if our plans take us back to Palermo. The friendly service, the delicious breakfasts and the clear attentiveness and pride of both Staff and ownership was evident.","7427":"I just read what others said about the hotel and concur! The front desk staff (Stefania and Stefania!) were very sweet and helpful. Even tracked down a dentist for an emergency appointment for us. They also helped to carry luggage since there were some stairs to navigate after the elevator. We were in a brand new room and so everything was in perfect shape and very modern. Very large room, very well cleaned and really liked the style. The hotel is in a perfect location - so close the Massimo Theatre. If you go to the left, you can get to the four corners via a pedestrian only street and if you go to the right, you can get to a wonderful ice cream place! We did not have a car there and were able to get around quite easily by walking, since the location was so central. Just make sure you take the address with you since the hotel can be hard to find since there is only a small sign on the outside. When you enter, it may seem like you are not at the right location - but you are. And you will be really happy with your choice.","7432":"I stayed 2 nights in Palco this July, 2019. I usually stay in big chain hotels and I was very well surprised with the good and easy way of service that I received. Everything very personal, attentive and good. Amazing breakfast and very well cleaned rooms!","7436":"Charming and helpful welcome and assistance from management, the two Stefanias. Help with valet parking and advice with maps given on sightseeing and restaurants. Good communications prior to arrival. Gorgeous stylish decor and very comfortable room with the best bed in Sicily. Fantastic location, with balconies opening out onto the Opera House and amazing daytime and nighttime views. Lovely breakfast in light, colourful dining room. Immaculately clean. Double set of balcony doors made it quiet at night in spite of hubbub below at street level. Air conditioning was quiet too. We loved Palco Rooms and Suites and will recommend it to friends.","7440":"The Palco Rooms was everything we hoped for. The location was fabulous especially as a base to visit other locations. The bed was extremely comfortable which is a big plus. The room was spacious and clean. The owners were very pleasant and very helpful. I would highly recommend staying here and needless to say I am fussy!","7446":"This beautifully decorated B&B has the perfect location in Palermo, literally next to the Teatro Massimo. This gives ready access to all points especially into the old city. Room are beautifully decorated include personal Nespresso machine. Breakfast is started with freshly squeezed orange juice and a delightful selection of foods and freshly made coffee or tea. Stephania and Giacomo have created a lovely place to stay and the personal service is simply outstanding.","7451":"\u00b7 Very modern and clean b&b located in a quiet zone of Agrigento close to the center and Valley of the Temples.The rooms are very comfortable,clean and quiet.The exterior area of the b&b is nice and protected by a fence where you may park your car safely.Breakfast was delicious and well prepared by the fabulous Stefania that takes care of any detail for an idyllic accommodation. \u00b7 Although,it is a bit difficult to find the property,as it is on a busy road on your left side ,of the main road,Stefania sends you the right GPS details that you have to follow.The location is proper for those having a car ( not recommended for walking in the city),cause it is not safe due to the road. Definitely,I would recommend it.","7452":"We just had the great fortune to spend 11 days in Palermo with friends. Giacomo and his wonderful family made our stay easy and exciting. The hotel is in a perfect location and we were treated like honored guests. Breakfast had something for everyone. Giacomo was our guide to all the beautiful locations we wanted to see. We can\u2019t say enough good things about our experience. They made us feel at home in this very interesting and safe city. Highly recommended.","7454":"We stayed for a night and I have to admit that I didn\u2019t expect a B&B of this quality in this city . Plenty of parking space in front , just outside the mess of Agrigento . The valley of the temples is 6 km and 10 mins drive . The room was big and very modern . Nice bed and nice toilet . The big weapon though is the owner . Cristina speaks perfectly English ( rare in Italy ) and prepares the breakfast herself . Fantastic cakes and very personal touch and approach . She made a very friendly and pleasant environment. Really worthy to stay","7457":"A first trip to Sicily, June 2018, and why not start with ample days in the capitol, Palermo. We picked the very central Palco Rooms, with hosts Giacomo Vena, and Stefania. The location is really good, and central for all the walkable city features. The room was very smart, and cool, in both senses, in June, and comfortable. Breakfast was also well planned, fresh, local and generous. A family feel. Worth a try. We will be back.  If you can stay, try the very nearby Teatro Massimo Vittorio Emmanuel, and the simpler Teatro Politeama Garibaldi. Main tip? Take time to get to know Palermo.","7460":"Excellent, hostess Stefania beautiful inside and out . Modern Beautiful rooms , patio breezy break fast outstanding!!! Ask Stefania for dining places in old town . Easy drive to Temples , and Turkish Stairs , a must watch for sunsets!!!","7469":"We were a group of 9 friends who stayed in Palco Rooms&Suites for 4 nights. The accommodation was excellent; the staff were super friendly and helpful; and the ambience of the whole place was artful and quite unique with very interesting artworks. I would definitely stay in Palco next time I'm in Palermo.","7472":"This place is just sheer and utter bliss. I spent four days here and cannot praise Stefania and Giacamo enough. One could say there just are no superlatives superlative enough to describe Palco Rooms. The situation, the beautiful room, the amazing breakfast, the personal treatment,nothing was too much trouble. One was made to feel like a VIP, Capital V, capital I capital P. I am back home now and still in seventh heaven when I think of this couple and their hotel. All the Certificates for Excellence are deserved ten times over. Palco Rooms cannot be praised highly enough. This place is a bit chunk of heaven in Palermo.","7475":"This place has the perfect location, all the sights walkable. As you would expect, Palermo is no different to many Italian cities where the driving is crazy but we phoned ahead and a lovely lady met us and drove our car into the garage. Room was exactly as on website and very clean. Thank you.","7477":"My partner and I stayed at Palco Rooms in July 2018. This is a truly an excellent hotel and Stefania the host was very friendly and efficient. The rooms are very modern, clean and well appointed. The location of the hotel is quite central, next to the opera house. I can highly recommend the hotel - thank you Stefania :-)","7478":"My husband and I stayed four nights at Sorahnia Design House and enjoyed every minute here. As previous reviewers said, the house is modern and created with great taste. The breakfast was simple \u2013 scrambled eggs with salt and pepper, bread, butter, coffee, cappuccino, cheese, homemade jam, different Italian cakes every morning, and fruits! It was perfect for me, maybe not for my husband who would prefer more choice in terms of ham, for instance. Anyway, the quality was excellent! The room was cleaned really well every day.  Although the main road is nearby, the place is quiet and peaceful. Agrigento\u2019s city centre is less than 10 minutes by car, which makes it a perfect accommodation for exploring the area.  Stefania is a wonderful host. We got lost while looking for to find the house at our arriving and she helped us to find the place over the phone. Thank you for your great hospitality. If we have a chance, we would come back!","7479":"We loved, loved, LOVED this place. So clean, cool d\u00e9cor and really central. A perfect location for exploring Palermo. Stefania was FANTASTIC! She was so helpful, explained everything about the room and surrounding location to us and even popped in later with an umbrella for us because it was raining. Breakfast next day was really tasty, again everything spotlessly clean. Before we left Stefania booked us an appointment and minded our bags for us. Fantastic start to our holiday. I would HIGHLY recommend this place!","7481":"You can't beat the location, right around the corner from Teatro Massimo and tons of outdoor restaurants, in the heart of the historic district. Our room was fashionably decorated -- oh so white everywhere. The service and hospitality was quite good as well. We highly recommend this place. The view out our window was obscured due to construction, which continues thru this fall. But they did tell us beforehand, and since we were mainly in the room to sleep anyway it didn't really matter anyway.","7484":"This design bed and breakfast is simply perfect. Located near the centre of Agrigento, this family home has five rooms, with their ensuite bathrooms and extremely comfortable beds. I highly recommend this place not only for the rooms but also for the wonderful owner who will make your stay a dream stay. Her home cooked breakfast cakes and her cappuccinos are perfect.","7485":"We stayed here for four days and were delighted with the overall experience. Stefanico could not have been more welcoming and recommended and booked a fish restaurant nearby which turned out to be excellent. The location in downtown Palermo is hard to beat. The main shopping street and many of the sites are literally on your doorstep. The magnificent Theatre Massimo is across the road and a night time drink in its garden bar is highly recommended. Look no further if you want to combine an excellent and safe location with a friendly and professional service.","7490":"If you are looking for a great hotel b and b in a great location, look no further. Across from the opera house, the hotel is perfectly situated between old and new Palermo. And right on the Blvd which is blocked off for pedestrians. Great restaurants in quaint alleys are right there. The room has insulated windows, so despite being on this active street, it is completely quiet inside, clean with great modern bath. The owners are fabulous and so helpful in planning our visit. They arranged a great driver, Antonio, to take us to valley of the temples, and our transfers back and forth to the airport. They were very very responsive to all our questions and requests. I highly recommend them. A great place to start our vacation. While there is an elevator, there is about ten steps up to lobby.","7498":"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Palco Rooms & Suites. The location is ideal - easy walking distance to all the sites. The decor is modern with a touch of whimsy. The rooms and the common areas sparkling clean. The breakfast was plentiful and slightly different each morning. Giacomo and Stefania were so welcoming and always there to offer helpful advice and tips. I highly recommend.","7503":"We eventually found the blank warehouse-like door with a bell for Palco. We rang it a couple of times and, eventually, this scruffy guy appeared to let us into a dark empty hall with a tiny elevator on the far side. The scruffy guy disappeared. The friendly Palco greeter arrived in the elevator, but it only fit two of us and one bag. We got off on 2 and entered another scruffy foyer with no sign of hotel yet. After hauling our bags up a flight of stairs we finally got to the desk. Our room was large and comfortable but the entire building was arapped in translucent advertising tarps so our view of the opera house from our balcony was not to be had. Staff always friendly, breakfast fine, but when we stopped at the desk on our second night to get directions to the restaurant they allegedly booked for us, no one was around so we left to find a place on our own. Buyer beware.","7525":"We enjoyed a fabulous long weekend at the end of November at the Palco Rooms&Suites. I booked two rooms (one for two, and one for three) and they ended up being a three room suite - two bedrooms with a living area with sleeper sofa in between - perfect for us and our three adult children! Great location in the center of Palermo - convenient to everything. As a result, it is a bit loud in some of the rooms (street noise), but doesn't take away from all of the positives of this property. One of the highlights was our stop at the Opera House, as it is right across the street. We decided to do the tour and were fortunate to see the rehearsal for a show opening just a few hours later! Giacomo went above and beyond by arranging a last minute wine tour for us about 1 1 2 hours away - with him as the driver and guide! We also enjoyed some of his favorite restaurant recommendations. Great service, great location, great stay!","7526":"Pleasantly surprised, enthusiastic. Rooms in excellent condition, modern. clean, worth a visit, despite the location. Everything is accessible by car. The owner is excellent, breakfast is healthy, a great choice, wonderful desserts. in short super, grazie anche per telefonata","7535":"After a long drive to Sorahnia we were so thrilled with our accommodations. New,beautiful and so clean! The owner Stefania is lovely and the breakfast she makes is outstanding. Wish we had more then one night to stay as it was such a relaxing B&B!","7537":"The place opened less then a year ago, outside of Agrigento, you need a car to get there. The rooms are very clean and with modern design. We stayed 2 nights there and Stefania is a wonderful host, she is preparing a delicious breakfast every morning, is smiling all the time, and you can see that she really enjoy being a host. Also is speaking very good english and is a good cook. A bit difficult to exit this location, because of the sloping bend in the road where the driveway is located. Also, to get there you should put on your GPS the street Salvatore Schifo, which is very close. Agrigento is a city with a lot of apartment buildings, so staying at this place is a good choice to be far from the crowded areas. Thank you Stefania for being such a wonderful host, and thank you for the wine you offered me for my birthday !","7538":"But for the British Airways strike, we wouldn't have needed to book a night at Carella. I'm glad we did as it was a lot nicer than the Hotel Posta in which we spent the subsequent 4 nights.  Very near to the main post office and a short walk from Teatro Massimo, location is good for all the main Palermo sites. The entrance is discreet and the climb up 2 flights of stairs with suitcases is a very small annoyance but the welcome was friendly and the vibe cosy, unpretentious and a bit quirky; all the things we want from such an establishment. Our room only had one window opening out onto the rear of the building and so was a little gloomy but we didn't spend much there during the day so that mattered not a jot. There were sufficient power sockets for modern tech and the mini bar fridge was serviceable for our needs. The shower cabin was a little small but water pressure was just about ok.  Next morning, we had breakfast in a bright room into which the sun poured and we tucked into a breakfast replete with tantalising, homemade-style options, including some great cannoli. Italian hotel breakfasts can be dull and limited in range but we felt spoilt for choice.  All staff members we came into contact with were friendly and helpful and we were very sorry that we only had one night in Carella. Maybe next time!","7542":"The room and cleanliness can be improved, the colors are a bit dark. This is my opinion, but it is the same as in the photos, so everything is fine. Breakfast is very complete but not very healthy. The location is perfect and the staff gives very good recommendations. Note. I did not like to pay a bottle of watter. Nowdays, everywhere offers you a couple of bottles for free.","7546":"Pros Had the 'mare' room which was well sized. Good shower and bathroom linen. Great air conditioning which was essential given the heat in July. Friendly staff. Well priced. Handy location. Reasonable breakfast.  Only possible con is that it is on first floor with no lift - fine for us but others may be more more limited by this.","7563":"Very small room, poor lighting, and no storage for clothes. Nice shower, comfortable beds and good location. Poor service in reception although people pleasant when available. Be aware if making standard reservation, they expect you to pay cash.","7576":"This is an amazing place to stay. Riccardo and his family made us feel so welcome from the moment we arrived. They contacted us about our arrival time and were waiting to assist us with parking and our luggage. We were given refreshments on arrival and then shown our room. The rooms are lovely and very clean with a beautiful view of the beach. The beach is only a short walk and there are many restaurants close by. They leant us an umbrella and towels for the beach also. It is very close to the Valley of the Temples and Riccardo gave us exact instructions for our GPS and it made the visit so much easier. He also suggested other attractions to visit in the area. Breakfast was great with many home made options available which tasted amazing. The coffee was also very good. This stay was a home away from home and we were made to feel so welcome from the moment we checked in to the moment we left. I would definitely recommend this property and would stay here again. Thankyou so much Riccardo and your family!!!!","7581":"Very nice place. They are very helpful and arrange transportation for you to and from the airport for a decent price. Breakfast is very good. I have several food allergies and they had foods I could eat . We felt very welcome here. They do get good tips also for getting around. We\u2019d visit here again. Thank you for the warm Sicilian welcome!","7596":"Located in San Leone just 8 min drive to Valley of the Temples. Clean and comfortable room is newly and tastefully decorated, every small detail was thought through; compact but very functional bathroom; quiet location, balcony with a sea view. The refrigerator (every room is assigned a labeled shelf) and a kettle are available in the shared kitchen. Wonderful selection of breakfast items for any taste, and delicious pastries (the pistachio croissant was amazing). The hosts are most pleasant, the entire family contributes to the enjoyable stay of guests; both sons take turns and help with communication in English. Wonderful experience.","7599":"Host: Family-owned B&B. Alberto and his sisters were so nice. We checked in at 1am in the middle of the night and yet Alberto was there to greet us kindly.  Rooms: perfect. Spacious. Clean. Separate private bathroom with shower. Comfortable bed. Enough room for suitcases. Don\u2019t expect any views from the windows though.  Breakfast: perfect. Enough choices. Cute dining room.  Location: perfect. You can walk to all over Palermo for sightseeing.  There wasn\u2019t any flaw in our stay. Just a great B&B to stay at. One thing that I might mention is that the cleaning lady came banging on the door at 10.15am asking if we wanted more amenities. I think she could wait to do that until the afternoon. We could have easily been still sleeping had we not woken up to catch breakfast. So there could be a \u201cdo not disturb\u201d sign, which wasn\u2019t available.","7603":"We stayed here for 7 nights in June. It was the perfect base to explore Palermo, walking distance to all the sites and restaurants just around the corner. Frederika gave us tips about cultural events in the city and also provided a scrumptious breakfast of fresh warm pastries, fruit, cheese and salamis. And excellent coffee! The rooms are spacious, all the mod cons and very clean.Try and get a room with a balcony. Decor is quirky and very lovely.The airport bus is a short walk away, and the staff can also organise a car to take you to the airport. Highly recommended.","7605":"Some of the best things happen when you least expect it. This happened in November when I was traveling with my wife and another couple who were originally from Italy. This was my third trip to Sicily. My second was on a bicycle in 2015 so I had a good list of B&B's saved to choose from. In Agrigento I planned to stay in a small town at the same place I stayed twice before just outside of Agrigento. Unfortunately they were closed because it is slow season. They recommended another B&B in the neighboring town of San Leone. We called the owner but she was away for a few days so she recommended her friends across the street. That is how we ended up at Le Notti di Morfeo with the wonderful owners Michele and Sabrina. First there was no problem parking the car outside on the street. They and there son insisted on carrying our four suitcases up to the second floor. You then arrive into the most beautiful B&B with three spacious rooms and a nice sized breakfast room, all remodeled to perfection in every detail. They recommended an incredible fish restaurant right on the beach about a 10 minute walk, where at the end of November we were still able to eat on the open air patio enjoying the sun and sea. Their breakfast was spectacular with lots of Sicilian specialties. Their location is about 50 meters to the beach and there is also a peekaboo view to the ocean from the balconies of the two rooms that we stayed in. We stayed for two days and the location was super convenient to enjoy the city and monuments of Agrigento and other surrounding towns.While having breakfast on our second day prior to checking out we asked where we could get some of the Sicilian cookies that they served for breakfast. No sooner had we asked, Michele snuck away and by the time we had our bags packed he arrived back from the local bakery with a parting gift of the best cookies we have ever had. I would return just for those cookies. If you want a real Sicilian experience treat yourself to Michele and Sabrina's gracious hospitality.","7620":"I stayed here recently and loved it! Full jacuzzi in the room. It was really nice!!! It was very close to the center. It\u2019s also incredibly affordable! Definitely worth staying here. The breakfast was okay, but did the job.","7648":"My wife and I stayed in B&B Carella for a 3 day trip in Palermo. The location is very central, lovely room, nice price and the staff were very helpful and nice. We would definitely recommend to others.","7653":"Host Fredericka was very helpful with suggestions and speaks good English, the room was fine, and the breakfast could be supplemented a bit, like eggs, for American tastes Be sure to visit nearby Montreale.","7667":"We left another four star hotel to come to this hotel, because the reviews were so good here. The minute we walked in the door we understood why. The service in this hotel is friendly and impeccable at the same time. The hotel is beautiful and totally thought out. It\u2019s like you\u2019re staying in a very comfortable and cozy boutique art gallery on the sea. You have to see it to totally understand the experience. The rooms are extremely comfortable and luxurious. The breakfast was amazing. We highly recommend you stay here and would definitely come back whenever in Sicily.","7671":"We stayed one night at this hotel, the last of a two-week Sicilian vacation, to be near the airport ( 30 min drive) for departure the following morning. What a great boutique hotel. Its location is fabulous, right across the street from the ocean and rocky beach. The decor is wonderful and modern, filled with great art. As a couple who usually enjoy old-world luxury style accommodations, this was different for us but highly enjoyable. The room, with a balcony, was very nicely appointed. A great freestanding tub and an amazing shower were greatly appreciated. The infinity pool was clean and refreshing. The staff were superb. So friendly and helpful for us. We appreciated the free parking that is provided with the hotel. The location allowed us to walk to town for a great dinner. All in all a wonderful place to spend our last night in Sicily. Highly recommended.","7675":"We arrived in Agrigento during a downpour (practically the only rain during our two weeks in Sicily) and as luck would have it, the GPS conked out as we drove toward La Casa di El. Once we finally found it, the stress of arrival disappeared as Alfonso greeted us, and another couple from France, with graciousness, humor and charm. He meticulously familiarized us with our location, providing maps and restaurant suggestions. We decided to stay in a mini-suite on the 11th floor and are glad we did: it was comfy and private. We parked in the nearby public garage for two days and it was convenient and reasonable. Getting back to Alfonso: he is the perfect host, as further evidenced by the delicious breakfast he prepared each morning. Grazie mille Alfonso.","7676":"My husband and I stayed here for three nights and didn\u2019t want to leave! The staff is extremely attentive and polite. We loved the clean pool and sun chairs for lounging. The rooftop has such a beautiful view! Good breakfast and even will make you light lunch options which are fresh and delicious. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Mondello Beach. We literally tried to extend our stay and would have if they weren\u2019t already booked up!","7680":"This really is a fantastic hotel. Our room was superb - impeccably clean, spacious and with the most comfortable bed I\u2019ve experienced in a hotel. The pool is stunning , the communal areas are stylish and beautifully decorated with art work and the grounds are kept immaculately clean and tidy. The rooftop area offers amazing views over Mondello bay. All staff, without exception, were friendly and extremely helpful. The hotel is a couple of minutes from the seafront square where there are numerous bars and restaurants. This really is a faultless hotel! Thoroughly recommended.","7682":"It is very nice B&B at great location, mere few minutes walk from the very city center. The room was large with a balcony overlooking the old city and nicely decorated with a lot of thought and style. The owner was very nice and helpful and he prepared us the breakfast every day, which was the best we had on our tour of Sicily. It is on quite good location if you are coming by car, as it is situated on the very edge of pedestrian-only zone. There is free residential parking in front of the B&B and guarded public garage just 2 minutes walk away.","7683":"We spent 4 nights at this amazing hotel and every moment was memorable. The staff are exceptional and couldn't do enough for us. All spoke English and were like old friends - however not intrusive. Marina, Monica, Veronica and Fabnzio - made our stay perfect. The hotel itself is absolutely gorgeous, the bathroom large, well decorated with impeccable taste. Guests are entrusted with staying amongst wonderful pieces of art. Breakfast was great, snack food fabulous. It was our intention to do day trips to Pescara but we didn't want to leave to hotel, so we didn't. We have done a great deal of travelling and this is one of the best hotels we have stayed.","7685":"The hotel does look like the pics, but in my opinion is over priced and the area has seen better days. Most of the staff are lovely buy one of them made my last day a misery. I'd basically booked the wrong day online at booking.com, I turned up at the hotel where they told I'd booked July instead of June but not to worry they had a spare room. However the staff member of checked me out told me I had to pay twice...the non cancellation date as well as the day I'd actually stayed. She said she wouldnt be able to call booking.com as it was a Saturday. I called they were open...ad then I spent the next 4 hours trying to get booking.com to liaise with the hotel. I eventually sorted it as one of the staff came to my rescue, but for \u00a3300 a night this was some of the worse customer service Ive experienced.","7686":"We had an en-suite room on the 11th floor with balcony and unforgettable view by day and by night on the Valley of the Temples, the sea and harbour. The room was a masterpiece of design items and even had a piano ready to play an italian serenade .... Breakfast again in a luxury room decorated with fine items. The breakfast is made by Alfonso to your wishes sweet or classic and the marmelades of his mother are just another delight. Superb. Alfonso, we hope to be back one day...","7689":"Excellent location on site parking, bus stop outside. Beautiful pool area with gorgeous view. Large bathrooms. Lots of places to eat close by. Staff were amazing friendly nothing too much trouble can\u2019t fault it. We will return. Superb location for long weekend in the sun for singles or couples,","7691":"Spent 3 nights here, and loved it. Booked for 2 nights but had to stay an extra night because I sprained my ankle badly. This means we spent the first 2 nights on the 11th floor (as originally booked) and the extra night on the 1st floor. Our host Alphonso was amazing. He found a doctor to treat me, arranged for us to stay the extra night, all with incredible graciousness and care. We were 2 couples traveling together and the accommodation suited us well. One of the spacious 11th floor suites had a spectacular view of the water and Valley of the Temples, gorgeous view from the balcony, and a piano!! Views from the 2nd suite included the old town and sea. On the first floor you also have a great ocean and Valley view, as the building is on the hill in the centre of the old town (central to all amenities). And the first floor has a small, atmospheric terrace where we ate and relaxed. We can't thank Alphonso enough for all of his assistance and recommendations for food and shops.","7694":"Clean, newly renovated, state of the art appointments. Parking on site. Made to order breakfast is delicious. Staff is gracious and kind. Convenient to all sites in town. A must in Mondello. Wonderful place to stay, I will return in the future.","7715":"This is a lovely small hotel, beautifully furnished and clean, rooms have views over the Valley of the Temples to the coast, the bed is comfy and the shower is good. Alfonso is a welcoming, helpful and informative host and the breakfast is superb.","7743":"Need somewhere to stay in Agrigento, Sicily? This B& B is the perfect choice. The owner, Alphonse was a wonderful host. This apartment is right in the town of Agrigento, and is most comfortable. And the breakfast was sumptuous - fit for a king! A most enjoyable stay.","7751":"Two couples arrived after a full days' sightseeing in Enna. The rooms are comfortable and airy. The breakfasts were delicious and plentiful. Alfonso was the perfect host. The rooms were clean. Parking is not quite so easy, nor is finding the B&B with the one way system, however it is very convenient to local restaurants","7765":"The location of the B&B is not fat from the interesting parts of the city, and in a quiet neighbourhood. The lady responsible is very kind, and helpful. The rooms are clean as the bathroom. The breakfast is super nice and complete!","7793":"Very nice staff\r Clean and comfortable rooms\r excellent and healthy breakfast with fresh fruits whole bread\r The best situation for visiting palermo on foot\r There is s public carpark 400 meters away for 9\u20ac a day","7820":"After an extremly testing day of travelling from Saracrusse to Palermo we arrived at this small Bed & breakfast\r \r The room was extremly clean. Whilst it didn\u2019t have an en suite it did have its own bathroom across the hall that we had a key to. The bathroom had a hairdryer and there was a fridge in the room with a large freezing cold bottle of water included\r \r We slept really well, the bed was comfortable.\r \r The next day we awoke to a wonderful Sicilian breakfast. Fresh pasties, cheeses, cold meats, cereals and even an older gentleman ( not sure who he was). Came in with cannolis and filled them in front of us with cream cheese. A lovely touch l thought.\r \r I only wish I had more time to explore Palermo as the night we arrived. Francesca showed us some very interesting places to visit but we were late getting in and up early the next day to fly home\r \r The staff were extremely friendly I would definitely recommend this place","7823":"All that I can say is that this is a fantastic place to stay when visiting Palermo. It is family run and they were the most helpful and kind people I have ever encountered. The Alba Camere is centrally located and the service is excellent. I would not hesitate to recommend it to any prospective travelers to Palermo.","7872":"Our stay was out of season, so the hotel decided to use this opportunity to build more hotel rooms for the summer season. However, this meant we were woken up at 7am with workers hammering next to our heads through the wall. I appreciate that hotels are allowed to expand but we should have been warned of this during check in. I made a polite comment to a staff member about my tired state and she simply joked and agreed she was in the same state; if she is aware of the necessity of sleep then perhaps she should have arranged for the workers to start their jobs later. Even 8am would have been more acceptable.\r \r Friendly and informative staff with a good, free breakfast. However this does not increase my rating as a sleepy tourist can become quite agitated.","7878":"It's important to outline that the room above comes with a private bathroom, but it's located across the entrance and is too narrow and small! The next point is that if you're spending 45\u20ac, including a good breakfast!\r All was fine, located right around the corner of Teatro Massimo, one of the largest Opera houses in Europe!\r We had a good time strolling to the main point of interest, on foot!\r Beware about the parking though. We weren't too lucky with that, so I suggest to pay \u20ac9,00 and use the private parking!","7922":"Nicely furnished room.The staff ws very helpful, showing me how to get around town and find sites. It is only about a 10 minute walk to the historic city center and less than ten minutes walk to the train station","7923":"What an incredible disappointment this hotel is; I checked in last night and wish I could check out this morning (unfortunately I pre-paid for 5 nights).  I swear the bed is only a box spring...I might have been more comfortable sleeping on the floor. It was THAT hard. The room is huge, and could have used a bit more furniture and soft touches, like pillows.  For a property that claims to be 4.5 stars, I would expect glass coffee mugs. Alas, you're given plastic cups and spoons to make your coffee tea.  The breakfast is sparse. Lots of cheese, bread, desserts and some yogurt. Although it's included, if you're hungry and don't eat cheese because you're recovering from a terrible cold...go elsewhere.  The hotel is centrally located so that is its one saving grace; you can walk everywhere.  I've already asked the front desk to help remedy the situation. I'll update this post should the situation get resolved.","7925":"If you are driving, don't follow any GPS directions since they leave you at places you cannot drive. Entrance is odd for a big hotel since it's on what is really an alley. But the hotel itself is top-notch in all respect for rooms, staff, food, meeting places.","7933":"This beautiful hotel is in a safe location walking distance to everything. We had room 339 with a king bed and huge terrace. Nearby is the best street food place in town where we got takeout and ate outside on our private terrace. The rooms are each different. We loved ours.","7935":"this hotel has a great location for walking anywhere in old city palermo , restaurants and the waterfront...... but our room had no window.... had a disgusting smell, and i thing we slept on the boxspring with no mattress!! no no ! i'm sure there are much nicer hotels to stay with awesome locations too.... also the food and the waiters are miserable","7938":"The first thing that we noticed was its position in the Old Town of Palermo located as it was between the Royal Palace and the harbour. As we were on a tour of historical and archaeological sites it was perfectly located. It seems from diagrams upstairs in the hotel that it had once been a Palace and or a convent, or both. Consequently it was large with rooms around the large courtyard which could be closed to exclude the elements.  Initially, we found the breakfast buffet to be large but to be quite basic for a hotel of its apparent class: fruit juice drink,not fruit juice and limited hot items, until we found that we could get freshly squeezed Orange juice and individually cooked items, which made a great difference.  Fortunatel for us, sufficient numbers of the staff spoke English, as our Italian was awful.","7940":"This hotel is in a converted bank which includes a grand lobby open atrium. The location is fantastic. It is a 3 minute walk to Piazza di Marina, 6 minutes to Quattro Canto. You can walk throughout the old city from the hotel. Our room (339) had a lovely balcony. Breakfast is good and the staff is very attentive. Roberta and Leonardo at the front desk we\u2019re unbelievable - gracious and helpful. They recommended two nearby restaurants including Quid. They also arranged a car to get to the airport which was very reasonable. This is the place to stay.","7943":"We stayed here as it was the starting point for our Sicily tour. The hotel is in a great location and has a lovely courtyard area for relaxing in. Breakfast was included and there was a great range of food. Would definitely recommend this hotel.","7945":"We stayed here for 4 nights part of the Targa Florio trip. Staff were courteous and polite . Was also my birthday and they upgraded me to the junior suite which I would recommend staying in. Beautiful room with private terrace with stunning views. Lady at the reception who sent documents for me was very polite and professional and made the experience complete! Would def stay here again with my family!","7951":"Beautiful hotel and well placed for a walk around Palermo, within walking distance of the train station and the Main Street. Efficiently run hotel - when we arrived they'd allocated us two ladies a double bed despite our original request for twin beds but soon changed our room. Could have been tricky as the new room was split level within lighting over the steps up to the bathroom, or handrail, but we were very aware of the dangers. Piano entertainment in the evening in the atrium was more for the player than the audience - not everyone likes random jazz - and we could hear from our bedroom. One criticism would be the restaurant - food ok, but ambience non-existent, with overhead lighting in a huge room more akin to a canteen. We ate out after the first night.","7953":"The hotel is beautiful and in a great location. The hotel was able to arrange transportation from the airport to the hotel before arrival. The front desk was not very helpful, except for two interns who really did try to help. The curling iron did not work without a converter, and I only brought an adapter (my bad). The front desk insisted it should work, but it did not, until I located a converter - which was not an easy task. No help from the front desk on where to find one. Inquired at front desk as to Mass service times - they did not know, and made no attempt to find out. No irons in rooms. Front desk was not helpful at all. That being said, you do have internet access, so I suggest you find what you need on the internet, download directions before you leave the hotel. It works and is fine. I just love a great front desk. Drinks are available in the lobby, service is relaxed. If you desire service, you must get the attention of a waiter, otherwise, they will assume you are there to relax and talk. Or you can walk a few feet to the bar and order yourself. Once served, the service is great, prices are reasonablel, waites are very friendly. Your drinks are served with an assortment of nuts. Breakfast, which is included is everything you could want. It is served in elegant surroundings. Fresh ricotta, an assortment of cheeses, breads, fresh sliced tomatoes, delicious pastries, yogurt, eggs, ham, cold cuts - there is absolutely everything you could want. Waiters are on top of everything. Explore the hotel. It is beautiful","7955":"Stayed for two nights at the end of September, 2019. The hotel was welcoming and unique. Room was comfortable, had all the amenities you could ask for. Courtyard was a welcome spot to grab a drink before heading out for the evening. Was within walking distance to a lot of the sites and some great restaurants. Breakfast was plentiful (just ask if they run out of something) and standard for Europe.","7960":"Nice hotel., however we booked two standard class rooms, one a twin and one a double for our children. We asked in our booking for them to be next to each other. When we arrived they told us that due to lack of availabilty all they could offer were rooms on opposite sides of the hotel and on different floors. The only way that we could have them next to each other was to have deluxe rooms at \u00a350 per room per night extra. We had no choice but to take this, thereby adding \u00a3400 to our bill! They offered no compensation what so ever. We felt conned.","7963":"The bedroom was large and quiet. Tea and instant coffee with kettle and paper cups. Sometimes. Towels rather thin. Downstairs central area attractive. Breakfast pretty average for a four star hotel. Essential to ask for coffee specially prepared, espresso, cappuccino etc, rather than hotel coffee. Cereals basic. Good choice of milks. Bar claustrophobic and out of character. Great location. Don\u2019t dine there as reports from customers was not good. Rating between average and good overall.","7965":"Beautiful hotel in the building of the old stock exchange. Old school charm and absolutely brilliant location. Room was spacious - massive bathroom! Hotel room was clean and comfortable. Decent choice at breakfast time and the most beautiful lobby area courtyard. If I ever return to Palermo, will definitely stay at this hotel.","7969":"Lovely building where the rooms have been adapted beautifully for a hotel. Bedrooms and bathroom were on the smaller side but adequate. Restaurant was good but a snooty waiter detracted from the experience. Location was excellent and could walk to most major attractions","7972":"This hotel is built on the middle of a Palace with the foyer in the old central courtyard with a fountain. The style is old fashioned but the rooms are spacious and comfortable. A C and wifi work well. The restaurant serves a good breakfast and dinner was well priced with lots of Sicilian specialties.  We had a problem with a booking and the staff went out of their way to help.","7974":"The Piazza Borsa is in prime position to explore Palermo. It is a large hotel with a court yard in the middle. The rooms are large and comfortable. Breakfast very good and able to order eggs any way you liked them!","7977":"The room was small but well equipped. The shower was exceedingly small. The service was very good. The breakfast was included with the room. It was somewhat disappointing. Not that many options. The location of this hotel was great. We were able to walk to many different restaurants, shops and places of interest.","7983":"This hotel is well located and the foyer cloister is very grand indeed. Rooms are a good size and comfortable. The shower we had was over the bathtub but there are no grab rails and no non slip mat provided. There were no face washers nor any hair conditioner although shampoo and bath gel are provided. There was no milk provided to make tea or coffee in the room. We could only get one English Channel on the TV....being told that BBC WORLD was unavailable due to \u2018poor signal\u2019 The restaurant is very large and breakfast was served there...but I found the space unappealing, the staff gave the impression they didn\u2019t want to be there....not in the least bit friendly. The hot selection for breakfast offered tired looking scrambled eggs (possibly powdered?) and several scraps of bacon and tiny sausages. After inquiring we found out we could ask for fried eggs....but this wasn\u2019t offered without asking. My partner asked for fried eggs flipped but they came sunny side up. The coffee he asked for was cold so undrinkable. There were several small items on the bedroom rugs that were still there after the room was serviced. No English speaking Newspapers available. We stayed here to meet up with a tour group so I will let them of my review.","7991":"This is a beautiful hotel oldie worldie but the rooms are not. The staff are a little different and quirky or maybe it was just me but not as friendly as other hotels. Our tour guide told us it was a monastery in the past.","7993":"This is an old fashioned hotel, nice but without much charm. The staff at reception was very nice trying to help us with lost luggage. I don\u2019t have any complaints, but I probably wouldn\u2019t choose it again.","7996":"This is an old-style hotel with period atmosphere, rather autere but charming. It is situated in old stock exchange with a vast atrium. Dining room has large mural. Lots of 1950s features. Rooms were very comfortable and the buffet breakfast excellent with cake and Canolli. The reception staff were exceptionally helpful and polite. It is situated in a fascinating area of central Palermo. We will return whenever in the city.","7999":"Everything about this hotel from location to check-in check-out, restaurant, and housekeeping is top notch. The central courtyard is comfortable for relaxing after a day of seeing the sights. We arrived early evening so having dinner at Osteria Ballaro Restaurant was ideal since it is located steps from the hotel with great food and ambiance.","8002":"Stayed in this hotel recently and it is based in a good location and within walking distance to all the major sights. Staff friendly and helpful. The only gripe I have is that when the used the laundry service 4 T-shirts were returned considerably smaller than what was handed in. So maybe avoid the laundry service.","8004":"This hotel is in the center of everything should be 5 star but ... The staff here was wonderful , everything was clean there is a rooftop where you can go but nobody does. It has no pool but they will let you use a neighboring hotels pool is beautiful and a definite thing you should do it will cost you \u20ac30 one-way But it\u2019s worth it because it\u2019s beautiful overlooks the water in the pool is like bathwater drinks :cocktail: also. Here comes the but. They don\u2019t serve a hot breakfast there are many cakes pastries and croissants delicious verities. And scramble the eggs that were cool and also one sausage I know it\u2019s silly maybe it\u2019s cause I\u2019m American but the previous hotel which was also beautiful they were making eggs there was bacon so I think this breakfast was a little on the late side sorry but still great hotel wonderful location hope you like cake","8006":"Elegant and comfortable hotel. Spacious room with a useful lobby space between the bedroom and bathroom. Good location close to tourist sites and the station for the train to Agrigento. Great eating in the square behind the hotel. Despite the location it's quiet at night with excellent block out curtains so you get an undisturbed sleep. A real bonus is that you can use the facilities of a sister hotel in Mondello to swim in the sea or the enormous rectangular pool or just laze on the large sun deck","8009":"I stayed at the Piazza Borsa for 5 nights in May. The location, in the historic center, is wonderful: just about at the intersection of two of Palermo's main streets, Via Roma and Via Vittorio Emanuele Corso. You can walk to most of Palermo's sites from there. My room, 409, was tastefully furnished and large as was the bathroom. Initially, the room had an AC problem; it was unbelievably cold and so it was turned off my first night. Management fixed the problem and there was no further issue. Breakfast was the only meal I had there (except for one dinner.) It was good but could have been better: the coffee that was served for the table (I was on a tour) was made from chicory and undrinkable. You had to order coffee individually to get a decent cup (there was no charge for this). The breakfast offerings were varied but there wasn't enough choice of fruit. There was a lot of starchy breads and wonderful cakes and pies, though more apt for dinner dessert than for breakfast. The hotel didn't have any decent maps of Palermo (supposedly they'd run out) so had photocopied a map which was practically useless. The printing was very small and ink was pale. I would definitely recommend the Piazza Borsa with the caveat that not everything may function as it should.","8011":"I was impressed by this hotel. Obviously, group tours stay here because there are always notices posted for group activities. Yet, it never seemed crowded or cookie cutter. The atrium is a wonderful location for meeting friends and having an aperitivo. The rooms are very comfortable and the bathrooms are large enough to have bath tubs! I did not have the opportunity to try the spa but saw that it offered good services. Breakfast, as in all Sicily, was extravagant, with great coffee. I loved the location, with so much to see within a few blocks.","8020":"This hotel was once a convent. The outside does not do it any justice. Once inside it will pleasently suprise you. Marble floors and staircases, and the lobby withat is open to the sky with a retractable ceiling five floors above. All the rooms are different and large and comfortable and clean.","8022":"We stayed 2 nights as a part of a tour of Sicily. The hotel is okay. Some improvements are in place and others needed.  For us, we had two single beds that were dressed with sheets to be a double after a requested room change. No options were provided for a double or queen bed. It worked out okay, not great. It was Just a bit quirky.  The location is great and very walkable. The breakfast was good.  Watch out! The man in stairs are very slippery!  With additional improvements this hotel can step it up.","8031":"Spacious room and spacious bathroom. Excellent amenities. Clean, comfortable and quiet. Good service. Well located in central Palermo. Hotel has been renovated from an old bank and is beautifully presented.","8035":"We stayed one night pre tour and arrived late one evening. Check in was pleasant and efficient, although they kept our passports overnight. Our room was tired looking, almost shabby, and overlooked service laneways. Beds were comfortable and it was fairly quiet. The shower was hopeless- it leaked all over the floor because the water came out around the edges and not on your body!! Towels were thin, and there wasn't even a tiny shelf to put your toiletries. The breakfast was good with fantastic coffee. Avoid room 331","8037":"I stayed at the Grand Hotel Piazza Borsa while in Palermo recently for 4 nights. The room was comfortable with a single bed, a desk area and a wide screen TV with coffee and tea service Frig+ Microwave[-] The window looked out of the back of the hotel-there was no balcony. The bathroom was also comfortable with a tub and shower but there were no precautions should someone fall while in the tub, Grab bars, decals, or a mat for the tub were nonexistent. The mattress was soft but firm but after several nights my back began to ache. One thing that was a problem was the limited number of outlets in the room for charging phones, Ipads, etc more outlets would be helpful. WiFi+ The bathroom contained shower gel, shampoo etc.in small bottles and there were ample towels. There was no air conditioning and some days it would have helped. There was also a bathrobe and slippers provided. Overall, it was a comfortable stay and the staff was helpful and attentive. I would recommend and return but the outlet situation was a problem [at least in my room]","8038":"Nice hotel slightly hidden but I guess everything in Palermo is to a certain degree. Anyhow nice location and steps from great shopping and cafes. Everything in the room is nicely presented!  Love the room except for the mattress however I\u2019m traveling so two nights here I got a good sleep. My 4th floor room had three areas: the dressing lounge areas which is where you enter however it has a table with everything you need to make tea or coffee with comfortable seating. A large bathroom and a full size bed with tv and desk. Lots of outlets in the room and the bathroom is filled with everything you need! Shower gel, shampoo, shaving kit, shower cap, hand soap, great towels, bathrobes, slippers, cosmetics mirror, heated towel rack. Listen they make sure you\u2019re covered with all you need to be comfortable away from home. I\u2019d stay here again despite the not so firm mattress.  Room Amenities * TV    * Air conditioning   * Daily housekeeping  * Private bathroom  * Bathrobes  * Free toiletries  * Hair dryer  * Slippers  * Separate bathtub and shower  * Iron ironing board (on request)  * Desk  * In-room safe  * Electric kettle  * Separate living room   * Blackout drapes curtains   * Free WiFi  * Free wired Internet  * Room service (limited hours)    * Individually furnished  * Spa  There\u2019s more however I was more interested in the location more than the amenities so checkout there website because I didn\u2019t list it all. All pictures taken by me.","8040":"I stayed here with a tour group. The rooms are inconsistent. My bed was completely broken down. I felt like I would fall out of bed. Our bathroom had no place to put anything. The room was spacious, and breakfast was good, but what good is it if you don't get any sleep?!","8041":"This private B&B is perfectly located to discover the city, the temples and the surroundings by car. Located at the very west of the main Road Via Atenea in a typical residential area, you get to know the real Agrigento. And if you walk just two minutes, you are in the beginning of the old hood with all the restaurants and bars.  The rooms are minimalistic and very clean. The host Andrea is friendly, already takes care before you arrive and provides you a small, but tasty Italian breakfast.","8042":"I had booked a mid-level hotel and this turned out to be much grander than I had imagined. Great staff, wonderful lobby, comfortable room. The breakfast is quite nice and varied.  The hotel has a look of grandeur and plushness. It is close to all the sights and to the train station. I would stay here again.","8043":"this B&B is very nice, typical building, central location close to Agrigento city centre; we had a little issue with the door but the host immediately fixed it for us and showed great empathy and prompt problem solving - very tasteful breakfast - great solution if you want to visit the Valle dei Templi","8046":"We loved this place!! We used this as our jumping off point for the Valle di Templi and La scala dei Turchi. Just a 3 minute walk outside the town square with parking available just outside on the street. Anything on via Athena you will have to drag your luggage through the busy cobblestone streets. We stayed for 2 nights and couldn't have been happier. The room was immaculate, the bed a dream after our 12 hour days. I love it here, and wish we were going to be here longer... Grazie mille Andrea all of your suggestions were perfect!! And your help with my personal request was truly outstanding!! Sei il migliore!!","8048":"This hotel was booked by our luxury tour operator, so we did not choose it ourselves. I agree with the poor reviews, especially about the front desk staff rudeness and poor quality food. There is just no excuse for this in Italy in 2019. Although the building is convenient and the lobby attractive, it is downhill once you check in. Our small group of ladies stayed 3 nights - each with single rooms. We were polite and flexible. But we deserved better interaction from the front desk when we asked a simple question in English- like how to get an outside line to call our airline on a toll free number! (Desk would not help connect us to an outside line even though there was a lobby phone nearby, and our room phones would not connect.) Hotel NEEDS a good concierge who speaks English!! Our dinner in the hotel was completely inedible. Avoid at all costs. Wish they could provide some fresh fruit at breakfast- could be found only steps away at the local market. Thankfully we found some lovely restaurants nearby, who were very gracious: Like GUSTO (wonderful) and BUATTA (lunch and dinner.) Room was adequate, at best.","8050":"The hotel is in a great location close to shopping and site seeing. Our room was very nice and clean. My complaint would be the shower it was very difficult to navigate. Breakfast was typical Italiano and a pretty good spread. The coffee is wonderful. Lovely courtyard to sit in.","8052":"Lovely hotel, once the stock exchange. Friendly and professional service, nice large clean rooms. Breakfast was mediocre but the hotel is only minutes walk to some lovely restaurants. Situated about 20 minutes from Vittorio Emmanuele which is the Main Street an within walking distance to most sights in Palermo.","8055":"This hotel experience was spectacular. The value unprecedented. The staff extremely professional and courteous. Mr. Pietro was our bartender, server and pleasantly answered any questions we had. The room we had was clean, large and honestly you couldn\u2019t ask for more. The tub is a bit high to get into so it may be a challenge for the elderly. The breakfast was fantastic. A buffet style offering an ample selection suitable for anyone\u2019s taste. As a whole the hotel really is beautiful and you couldn\u2019t ask for a better location. Thanks for a great stay!","8060":"When our flight was cancelled, our airline put us up at the Grand Hotel Piazza Borsa. When we arrived, the front desk was ready with cheerful, efficient, bilingual staff who managed to check in 150 grumpy travelers in less than 10 minutes. Our room was very clean and comfortable, with everything we might need (inc. shaving and dental kits) and a shared balcony overlooking a residential courtyard (which was very quiet at night). Breakfast was an extensive continental buffet with excellent service. The hotel is centrally located, and the building is a beautifully converted bank with a gorgeous atrium. If we had been paying guests, I would have felt I had gotten excellent value for money. Highly recommended. (My only criticism is that the bathrooms need gas traps to stop the smell from the sewer, but we\u2019ve experienced this many times in our travels.)","8082":"The one plus point is that the hotel is in a great location walkable distance from all the spots you would want to visit but that's just about it. As you enter, the lobby is an enormous atrium which is very grand but lacking in atmosphere and not somewhere you can while away a couple of hours just reading. The service is offhand. Everyone at the front desk just gave the impression of not wanting to answer any queries. There wasn't one smile amongst the lot of them . The only decent welcome we got was from the very pleasant porter who carried our bags and recommended a good restaurant. We had booked deluxe rooms - perhaps we were just unlucky and the elderly tour groups which seemed to be the main clients of the hotel - got the best rooms but our rooms were most certainly not deluxe - overlooking a small dirty courtyard where bottles were stored. The rooms were in need of a serious refurb, were dark and dingy - you really wanted to stay out all day . One final thing - avoid the breakfast, in a souless room, so unappetising we just stuck to the croissants - the one good thing was the coffee. We really wanted to like the hotel. Its location was brilliant, it had great potential but next time in Palermo we won't stay here.","8085":"This was the first stop on our honeymoon in September, and was a perfect start to our trip. The concierge arranged a pickup for us from the airport for 40 Euro, and the driver was waiting for us as soon as we exited baggage claim. The breakfast buffet is great and the hotel restaurant made one of our favorite meals of the tip. The hotel is set off from the main road so it isn't too loud, but still in the middle of all the sights to see.","8086":"The hotel is tucked away in a Piazza just of the main street with it's entrance in a very quiet side street. The inner courtyard with a collonaded walkway and patios with lovely seating areas with only the sound of the tinkling fountain to break the silence is quite magnificent. It is usable in all weathers thanks to the sliding roof that can come over should it rain. I recommend seeking out the toilet with wheelchair access as its location is quite unique (spoiler alert - it's in the old vault with huge 30cm thick steel doors). The room was very large and well appointed; the bathroom, a great mix of historical character and utility. The included breakfast was super and the addition of free champagne, most welcome for those who wished it - or to make up bucks fizzes. Not too opulent or with service too fawning to make one uncomfortable but with just the right mix of quality build and fittings with attentive service to put this in my top 3 hotels I have stayed in (out of many hundreds). I very welcome alternative to modern concrete and glass edifices.","8091":"This hotel looks very grand from the outside, and even as you enter from the side through revolving glass doors, with its beautiful atrium to the right and the efficient offices to the left. But our room (208), while nicely decorated on the whole and spacious, overlooked a dingy cul-de-sac; there wasn\u2019t enough storage space (more storage in the hall, but the clothes rail itself was up so high it was difficult to reach); the bed was hard (like most Italian beds) and since I like a soft bed I bring a 2\u201d thick foam rubber square to lie on.  The bathroom was very dated - bath nice length but so high off the floor it was difficult to get into and out of safely; also the bottom of the bath was smooth and dangerous; the grouting around the top edges of bath had been replaced at some time with incongruous 1\u201d wide dark brown grout; the shower-head sprayed water across the window surface 6\u2019 away. On the positive side, it had 2 sinks and a bidet, and was spacious enough that 2 people could work side by side in comfort.  The room, on the bright side, was very quiet, had an easily operated safe, there was free wifi, the staff were friendly and helpful, there was an excellent laundry service, efficient AC, and downstairs the beautiful large atrium to enjoy.  The dining room was quite nicely appointed and the breakfast buffet fine for a basic (cold) continental buffet. The food provided for our one and only meal there sounded wonderful but didn\u2019t live up to its promise.  Because of its excellent location and the fact that there\u2019s a dearth of good hotels in the area, it\u2019s good for 3 stars. Should be 3.5 really, but in all honesty it doesn\u2019t merit a 4.","8093":"This hotel is very conveniently located in the heart of the city in a classical building with a huge lobby with a large roofless cloister. The room was spacious but a little quirky with three steps down to the bathroom.","8095":"When we checked into the hotel it was late in the evening and on entering our room we thought we must have been allocated the wrong room because it was so large. It was on the third floor with windows facing a back courtyard. The room itself must have been 20 metres long and the bathroom was also large. The buffet breakfast was great. You just need to beware that if you hop up from the table to fetch something else from the buffet, you might find the staff have cleaned your place and removed your drinks etc. The room was very quiet and clean and the hotel centrally placed in the city.","8100":"Spent a couple of nights on a business trip. Luxurious hotel in a historical palace. The main hall is what gives this hotel a unique taste among other same level accommodations. The room was elegant and quiet, everything perfectly clean. Excellent breakfast with fresh typical pastry. The spa is an added value, I had a massage at a reasonable price. Highly recommended","8104":"We enjoyed our 3 night stay here before and during a Globus tour. The large rooms were clean, quiet, and comfortable. We particularly enjoyed the open atrium where we could meet family and friends to chat and take part in some appertivo. The breakfast buffet was extensive and delicious. However the group dinner for the tour was not Sicilian enough as they seemed to try to appeal to our American tastes.","8108":"This is indeed a GRAND hotel. The huge interior courtyard, floors and the rooms all look like a place where royalty could have come. Having said that, it is an old hotel and being spread across multiple wings, you can get lost and the room interiors can look dated, so don\u2019t expect things to be as in a new hotel. The bed was very comfortable and I had a great night\u2019s sleep. The breakfast was extensive in its selections and the front desk was very helpful. I would stay here again.","8112":"We stayed at this hotel for three nights on a recent tour of Sicily. We were in room 101 which was spacious with a sitting area, bedroom and large bathroom with a shower over the bath. The beds were comfortable and the air conditioning was efficient. There is a lift. There is a lovely covered courtyard area with a fountain on the ground floor with tables and chairs. It has a glass roof but has retractable blinds if the weather is hot. There is a restaurant in which we ate dinner on one night but the food wasn\u2019t very good although we were a group of twenty one which may have been the reason for this. There were several groups staying and breakfast was a bit of a bun fight! You had to wait for hot water to be brought for tea - they could really do with an urn. We thought the choice at breakfast was a bit sparse. There is a small bar area although drinks were also served in the courtyard area. The staff were all very pleasant. The hotel was centrally located for all the sights.","8128":"Very friendly Giullia, a good breakfast and a perfect location! A nice room, and a ver confortable bed and a very good powerfull shower. The breakfast room was nice and cosy. And a balcony for the smokers.","8131":"The most difficult accommodation to access we've ever had!! R.Wagner consists of a few bedrooms with a small reception area (open restricted hours) and some communal space on the 3rd floor of a city centre apartment building. We arrived on a dark Sunday evening about 7pm to find the sturdy main front door firmly locked (you need a code to enter but due to flawed electronic communications we never received this - make sure YOU do!). A departing resident eventually let us in by chance, and then after a period of puzzlement another told us to go up to the 3rd floor (you have the choice of a tiny lift or a dark dismal staircase!). Even then we had to bang loudly on the R.W. main door to be finally admitted!! Phew! Once inside!, our room was actually quite well fitted out and spacious, as was the bathroom - so no real problems there. We also had a small balcony overlooking the street. Breakfast in an uninspiring smallish room was poor with a limited choice and also an unusually late starting time of 8-30am. Good points are that the receptionists (once we got to them!) were very pleasant and helpful, and the property is in a good central location near to sites of interest, bus stops and the port (ferries are within a normal walking distance). However, we did think that the accommodation was considerably overpriced for the limited facilities offered and we could not in all honesty recommend it to other travellers.","8137":"Pro's - great location off a lovely square with plenty of good places to eat nearby. Francesco, the owner was very nice. Con's - a c didn't work well (Francesco even tried to lower the temp for us), 8.30am breakfast too late, coffee not v good and breakfast choice only okay. We asked for a dinner suggestion and were referred to a place that doesn't get great reviews. With so many good places nearby, this was a bit disappointing.","8142":"The place was very clean, quiet, the staff exceptional assisted with recommendations for places to see and to eat. Great location, Breakfast provided had many options. I will definitely be going back!! Thank you :blush:","8146":"Before we got to Residenza Wagner, the staff was in contact with me from the beginning, making sure everything is in order and asking if they can help me with transportation or any other questions even during our stay, especially Giulia. Our room was very comfortable and had everything we needed and the breakfast was simple and delicious. Overall, I definitely recommend Residenza Wagner and thank them for their services!","8165":"An unassuming B&B behind the red door in a nondescript apartment building turned out to be a great oasis. Centrally located but very quiet, it was the perfect base for sightseeing and shopping. The owner and his staff were welcoming and full of ideas and tips, whether it be restaurants or sights to see. Simple decor and rooms but very clean....and tons of cable channels (albeit mostly in Italian). The little terrace off the common area served as our go-to place for a pre-dinner aperitivo or a place to chill in the wee hours (we bought great, chilled wines from a nearby liquor store). Parking a few hundred meters away worked well - but let the staff drive your car in and out as it\u2019s super steep and tight. Park on the curb and walk down to the garage.  Enjoy!","8202":"Pros: Modern, clean room Large shower Eager service Close to centre Value for money  Cons: - Bed looks very fancy, but mattress glides down from the floating bed - Place seem to be managed by a teenage boy who surely did his best in his own teenage way - We were reassured several times that there would be a gluten free option for breakfast, but rolls, bread and cake with lots of gluten was presented in the morning with the teenager pointing at it saying gluten free (which could have gone terrible wrong) - Breakfast took place on the terrace where a beautiful wooden table with chairs was placed right next to a cheap, orange plastic table with chairs. Even though the wooden table was not in use, we were told to sit at the plastic table. It tilted over a couple of times, with our food flying everywhere - The description seem to mention that the room came with balcony, which it didn't","8203":"A small friendly B&B in a great location in Palermo.Francesco gave some great recommendations for restaurants. we had a lovely ensuite room with a small balcony overlooking the road. Surprisingly quiet given the central location","8208":"The Apartments are conveniently located and very close to the center of the old city. The rooms are spacious and clean , the beds are very comfortable, the environment is modern and high tech. The breakfast consisting of healthy choices is ok. The receptionist was friendly and very helpful.","8213":"Secure residence in a great location. The bus stop is near but you can walk to the main historical sites. There is a great wine bar named HIC a few blocks away, ask Silvia for the location. It should be noted that Silvia is a fantastic host. Silvia assisted with many questions and arrangements.","8216":"We travel often and have visited much of Italy. During our two weeks this time around we decided to peek into Palermo for two nights.  When we first arrived the first night we stayed at the Artemesia Palace Hotel. We enjoyed staying there but could only stay for one night because there was no availability for another night. That led us to Residenza Wagner.  We didn\u2019t really know what to make of it at first because best we could tell the place is likely a townhouse that has been converted into a bed & breakfast place. In a unique way it is rather charming in that it\u2019s different than staying at a hotel because the place has common areas that amount to a living room with a small terrace.  The room itself was quaint, clean and comfortable. It had old world charm with contemporary features like air conditioning (that worked well), a TV with American channels available and a solid WiFi connection. The king bed was really nice too.  Of particular interest was the electronic set up to get in and out of the room and bathroom across the hall. It was pretty cool. Basically, if you are in the room, you hit a button that unlocks the bathroom and when done in there and you wanna go back into your room you hit a similar button that opens your bedroom door again.  The breakfast was acceptable in that you could find something to eat and had plenty of coffee.  A final note about Palermo.  Driving in the city is nuts if you\u2019re accustomed to say New York City where traffic is controlled by law enforcement and rules. Here in Palermo it\u2019s a \u201cfree for all\u201d. Just about anything goes. My girlfriend (Maria) drove the entire time and I felt as if we were in a game of \u201cBumper Cars\u201d like when we were kids. She learned to hold her ground in the crazy game.  If that isn\u2019t enough to scare you, Google Maps doesn\u2019t work well and even if it did, the street signs don\u2019t always match up to what the Maps App is saying. Be prepared to be lost. We found Yahoo Maps worked better.  Francesco (the owner) suggested a few places for us to visit. Bar Cheri had decent Granita and I suggest you go there if you like that. We ate at Ristorante Leone and thought the food was really good there too but the service was slow.  Ciao for now.  Joe L from Huntington, NY and now Sarasota, Fl","8219":"Residenza Wagner was much better than expected, even though it looked on the outside somewhat sad and anonymous, but when inside a nice world opens and the comfort of being in a relaxed place occurs immediately when you enter inside. The room was just great and the atmosphere was nice, the bath was delicious... No doubt that when I m back in Palermo, I know where to stay!","8222":"Great location, walking distance to everything. Nice room. Friendly staff (sylvia is fantastic!). Two downsides:the bathroom, although private, is outside of the room, and requires going out to a public area to go to the bathroom. And there is no checkin between 1:00pm and 4:00pm (we had to wait a few hours to get in our room). Still highly recommend.","8227":"Great location and value for money. Best of all was Francesco, the owner. When checking in, he provided local knowledge of where to go, where to avoid and where the \u2018locals\u2019 eat. Highly recommend this place!","8229":"Very good location, very nice room.There are some minor limitations: bathroom is across the hall with an nonintuitive electrical door opening mechanism, however it is spacious and well equipped; reception is not always staffed, so arrival hour has to be announced in advanced, however, staff is eager to accommodate wishes and to help.On the whole outstanding attention to client and excellent value for money. I most certainly would come back.","8232":"The location of this hotel is excellent, five minutes walk from the tour bus that takes you round the city and within easy walking of most visitor attractions. The car park recommended (18 euros per night) is also very convenient and close. The rooms have the most comfortable beds that I slept in the whole of Sicily. The external bathrooms are a little tricky as it is possible to lock yourself out of both your bedroom and your bathroom and be marooned in the corridor! In fact they are not really a problem as you have your own bathroom, but you need to understand the system. Our bathroom was poorly designed, if very comfortable. It would be sensible to get rid of the bath and put in a shower, as the shower water floods the bath surround which you keep having to slosh back into the bath. The hosts are delightful, charming and willing to help with anything. There is a very comfortable living room for use by guests and the bedrooms are large and well appointed. The B&B is extremely good value for money. I would go back there any day.","8236":"We stayed here for 3 nights. Came from Marsala on the bus so it was a 5 minute walk downhill all the way from the bus station. Alessio (the manager) emailed us before our arrival asking our arrival time which was nice. He also gave us some directions. It is a very steep slope down to the Villa from the street - the pathway down is just beside the petrol pumps on the main road - but we were helped up when we left. Breakfast was very nice and served on the terrace outside our room. Lovely to be on the ground floor - we both smoke so easy to pop out. Yes the room was dark when the curtains were pulled but we weren't there to languish in the room when there were Greek temples to be visited. The bed was very comfortable, the air conditioning was controlled by a remote handset and worked brilliantly. The bathroom was small but adequate for our 3 night stay. The bus stop for the bus to the Valley of the Temples is about 50 metres up the road. The central train station is just behind the bus stop so about 5 minutes walk from the Villa to the train station. We caught the train back to Palermo. We would definitely recommend this as somewhere to stay in Agrigento as it is in a very convenient position for transport, restaurants and the old town.","8244":"Residential Wagner is in a convenient spot. Shops and Restaurants close . Silvia the receptionist is a major asset, cheerful, helpful and always willing to help. Residential Wagner is very clean, breakfast is average. WiFi is good.","8247":"This guesthouse location is perfect. In the heart of everything. The room and common area is very well appointed. Our double room had a small terrace and a big bathroom that had multicolored lights in the shower area! Sylvia, at reception, was available until late. She is wonderful....catering to every need. Breakfast was good, included some special treats like canolli... Love this place!","8249":"What a find, this great B&B is perfectly situated close to the centre of Palermo. Loads of cafes, bars restaurants and sites and close by. The team that work here are excellent and made us feel very welcome and spent a lot of time to advise and support our first visit to Sicily- can not speak highly enough about this place.","8258":"Excellent location. Great big room with big bathroom. Very clean. We had a in suite bathroom, but not all the room are similar. The breakfast was store bought but nice. Since we stay 1 week it was tiring to have the same every day, but that will be true at any hotel. Excellent service. We got help to organize tours, pick up for airport, printing boarding passes. We got great recommendations for restaurants and the days we left earlier for the trip we got special breakfast in the kitchen. There is a common kitchen that can be used to keep things in a refrigerator or to warm your food and eat at kitchen table. Extremely quiet. Since is not a b&b or hotel you do not have a person at reception all day long, but they are reachable by phone.","8277":"Like others, this is a review with ups and downs. Rooms are in a beautiful old building with a tranquil garden and an excellent restaurant on site. Easy walking to the Centre Storico. There is free parking on the roadside but only about ten spaces, otherwise it's paying. The host is really friendly and helpful. On the down side, the room was very small and dark so we read outside on the very comfy sofas in the garden. The bed (IKEA) was a foam mattress and not very comfortable. And it was really difficult to find, being below the level of the road. You need to stop and park immediately after the petrol station near the top end of the road (100m from the train station).","8289":"We were welcomed upon arrival and given a thorough tour. Our hosts couldn't have been more helpful with local information and recommendations. The hotel is clean and well appointed. Our room was spacious with a private bathroom. Wonderful breakfast each morning in the breakfast room. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay.","8336":"We stayed here for three days. The b&b is located in the La Kalsa area of Palermo, i.e the oldest part of town. Our room was big, clean, atmospheric and surprisingly quiet for Palermo. Our host, Filippo, was very friendly and helpful. We will definately stay here the next time we're in Palermo!","8350":"We stayed 4 nights and had a wonderful stay. Exceptional decorum ( see pictures) and Room facilities. Breakfast was a delicious and surprise and personalized- we got scrambled eggs every morning with a smile from gentle hostesses Frederica and Francesca. Fresh fruit cut with sprinkles of coconut and chocolate-chips, yogurt, croissants and almond milk etc and a surprise -Cassatas ( see 4th pic of green pastry) Frederica also guided us to areas of interest and has very good knowledge of the area We had a wonderful time Definitely come back and would recommend to anyone Thank you Frederica for communicating with us well before we arrived about how to find the B & B and using good but cheap public transportation","8355":"What a fantastic bnb! Excellent location and comfy rooms. Federica prepared a delicious breakfast each morning, with individual touches each day.  When we arrived she took the time to draw on a map to show us where things are and give us her recommendations.  What a great host, we would love to come back.  Kate and Matt","8360":"We had a perfect stay, the staff is friendly and thoughtful. The room is spacious and confortable with a pleasant balcony. The breakfast is perfect with a lot of typical Sicilian food. Each day we discovered a new speciality. We have now an address in Palermo !!","8379":"We stayed here for two nights during our visit to Palermo.\r The rooms were spacious, clean and comfortable .\r Our host Marida was very friendly and helpful ,Please follow her advise of where to eat locally.\r Each morning she provided a lovely large,fresh breakfast.\r The location is in the centre of the old town and within walking distance of all the sights.\r We could not have asked for more during our stay.\r Highly Recommended.","8380":"Owned and operated by a young couple, Stupor Mundi is on the third floor of a building on a street between the Politiama Opera and Opera Massimo. There are 4 rooms and each is decorated in a theme. Our room, with a balcony and a nice bathroom, was decorated shabby chic. The bed is comfortable. Breakfast is an event: In the Sicilian tradition of abbondanza, you will feast on bread and cheese and yogurt and fruit. Eggs? They will make them for you. Sicilian marmalade. Sweets and treats. Danilo makes sure you do not start your day hungry and he will draw you a map of where to go and what to do. We arrived seriously jet lagged. We stayed four nights. Go. You will feel safe and leave happy.","8384":"Very nice b&b in the centre,just a few steps away from UNESCO World Heritage sites of palermo. Very good location also for restaurants and trendy bars with a lively atmosphere were you can enjoy a true sicilian aperitivo!\r Marida and her husband Francesco are very kind and helpful host. They also arrange pick up at the airport.\r The room (Santuzza) was super clean, well appointed, confortable size with a large modern bathroom. Fast free Wi-Fi.\r Generous breakfast.\r I enjoyed my 2 night stay very much.","8390":"Great location, spotlessly clean, superb service, good breakfasts. Francesco and Mari have lovingly set up a little home away from home for those lucky enough to book here. Splendid old house on the superb corner of the Corso and Antonio Patenostro, a street filled with artisan shops and great bars - Coletti!. I only wish I could remember the name of the wonderful woman who made up the rooms and set up breakfast. She's lovely.\r \r Our room was the larger corner room called a suite. It was beautiful and spacious, the bed comfortable, the bathroom large.\r \r (True the neighborhood is lively at night but the noise didn't seem too bad)\r Wholeheartedly recommend.","8391":"Danilo is a great host. His family is very lovely and helpful if you, for example, want to know things about Palermo. They made us feel welcome! The breakfast was also delicious. Also the location is great. This B&B combines the comfort of a hotel with the hospitability with a true Sicilian family. We recommend this place to everybody.","8400":"warm welcome, I'm late check in but the people was so helpful with whats up infos, fotos etc. needed garage for motorcycle and ther was ready to book one for me. rooms good condition, clear and comfortable Great pleasur and will return next time in Stupor Mundi B&B","8418":"Great experience, Danilo was an excellent host, Always attentive and the breakfast was awesome. Rooms were comfortable and clean and ours had a balcony. The balcony was wonderful for some pre-dinner wine... Loved the place, great value and would stay again","8420":"Booked Bedda Marie for two reasons, a good price, and very good location in the old part of town. Just a short walk to all the main sights.\r \r Marie was very helpful even before our stay, was texting me and arranging a airport pick up and giving advice. Maire and her husband actually meet us at the airport and gave us lots of handy information on the way to their place.\r \r Our room was small, but comfortable with a little balcony. Ear plugs are provided as can be a little noisy at night if you are a light sleeper.\r \r Breakfast was good, plenty of it. The only thing I wasn\u2019t so keen on was the juice in a carton with a straw.\r \r You don\u2019t necessarily get to see your hosts again after the first day, another lady comes in to set up breakfast, but that\u2019s fine as they are on hand by phone if needed.\r \r Very happy with our stay, would recommend for the great value and location, and very friendly and helpful service.","8421":"Wonderful stay at Stupor Mundi. Danilo is a fantastic host and goes out of his way to make sure you enjoy your stay. Rooms are great. Very large and comfortable with everything you need. Breakfast was delicious with very high quality products. I would highly recommend this B&B","8458":"I spent my birthday weekend in the gorgeous Deluxe Junior suite! Communication prior and during the stay was amazing, Davide and Francesco were great hosts! This is not a hotel or B&B in a traditional sense, most things are managed remotely and hosts give you a lot of privacy! The room was excellent, free bottle of Prosecco upon arrival! My favourite thing was the bed! SUPER COMFY! The shower and hot tub were incredible, especially after a long day of exploring the city! Be mindful of the water levels and side pumps, if over-flowing, the water will spill onto the floor and set off the flood alarm system!!! Lesson learned lol. Breakfast was average but worth it for the price of the suite! The area is so close to the main train station, all attractions are within 15min walk, the area might be questionable for some but I liked the vibe - filled with working-class locals :) I even received a gift as I checked out! Overall, I highly recommend this accommodation!","8460":"We approached this accommodation with some trepidation. The reviews were so great, and the photos beautiful, but why not higher priced? I wish we had been better prepared before we arrived. This is *not* a hotel, not even an inn, not even a B&B. It is an apartment, like an AirBNB. This is a great place to stay if you are on a budget, maybe a student, and you normally don't find nice accommodations for the money. The way Davide runs the transactions (everything by cell phone) is also more geared toward young people that more sophisticated travelers who may not want to share their private information. The neighborhood appears to be a little off-putting, especially as you approach and enter the building. It's about a 20 min. walk to get the heart of town, and a cab ride to some parts you may want to visit (and you may not want to walk back at night). In retrospect, I probably would have found a more traditional and upscale hotel in a better part of town more to my comfort, but again, these are very nice (modern and clean and pretty) suites for the money. It's all about managing expectations.","8466":"This place was clean and had all the necessities. Was well located on the main street of the city center. Good restos, nice shops close to many attractions. No view, no balcony but quiet, nice owners, parking was an issue, you had to park some distance away bring your luggage on the hike to the room. Although parking was far, everything was within walking distance.","8470":"I visited Palermo for the first and I booked to stay in Stupor Mundi after it was recommended by a friend...I was not disappointed! Danilo, Carmen and Chiara make you feel instantly welcome! Danilo is the perfect host and his knowledge of Palermo and it\u2019s History and Culture is second to none. Nothing we asked was too much trouble and everything we needed was catered for. The breakfast is fantastic and a real taste of traditional Sicily! It\u2019s location is perfect as it\u2019s extremely central but tucked away enough for a peaceful nights sleep. When I return to Palermo there is only one place I will be booking to stay in! Grazie Stupor Mundi","8473":"Couldn't fault this b&b, large rooms, nice balcony, comfy bed, great location and the hosts were perfect, always happy and helpful! I will definitely be returning! Breakfast in the morning was very good also! This is my 2nd trip to Palermo and I love it here and this b&b had a big part in making a great trip!","8480":"We stayed in one of the suites, it was stunning. Absolutely huge, two bathrooms, massive bed, great shower. The decor was incredible. Davide and the team are very welcoming and incredibly helpful. A real bonus is having breakfast in your room. The area is a little ordinary but it is a short walk from the centre of Palermo and close to bus services and the train station. The air con is godsend, the windows really help with the noise (it isn't noisy but being close to the bus station and just the general love for car horns in Sicily there is noise outside but usually from about 9am and the nights are very quiet) and the shutters make sleep a definite.\r I would highly recommend this B&B.","8481":"5 years ago, when visiting Palermo, we stayed in a terrific B&B. When making plans for this trip, I learned that, unfortunately, that B&B was booked but they recommended Stupor Mundi. Imagine my surprise when I discovered that Danilo & Salentina, current owners of Stupor Mundi, formerly operated the other B&B. As I said, that was a wonderful B&B and those high standards have remained constant at Stupor Mundi. We love this location of Palermo (near the Politeama, airport bus, lovely residential area, nice restaurants and high end shopping). The B&B itself is charming and clean with both staff and other guests being quite friendly. Yes, it's on a city street and at times noisy, but it absolutely never interfered with my sleep. Danilo is a wealth of knowledge re: Sicilian culture, language and food. He was also exceptionally helpful arranging for van transportation to both a family reunion in a nearby suburb and for a day trip to Monreale. There were many emails back and forth while making these plans and he staff were always patient, prompt and courteous with my many questions. Thanks! PS - Chiara, Danilo's assistant, was a pleasure to deal with.","8482":"Switched for this bed and breakfast during my short stay in Palermo due to it\u00b4s location. There is a direct train service from the airport to Stazione Centrale and the Normanno is in walking distance. Easy to reach, also when the surroundings are not really welcoming. Ok it\u00b4s a train station area. The building is old close to a larger road. Stairs up, the room is spacious and trendy modern, also the bathroom. No noise from the road and also from the other rooms. Slept well and you find several restaurants around the Stazione. No breakfast due to an early departure, back by train what works well. Might be also good to stay longer here and the communication with Davide was really nice.","8486":"When we arrived there had been a breakdown in communication and although everything had been sorted with Andrea her colleague Davide did not know. He was in a terrible hurry and frankly not welcoming. I now know why. He had a family issue (we all have from time to time) but he didn\u2019t explain. Later he did and apologised by sending us a lovely colazione. This place is lovely. It is a wee bit out of town but the cool places are quite nearby. Definitely go to Trapannia for dinner. It is what you want from a local family place. Rooms are really clean and shower is amazing. Don\u2019t hesitate.","8491":"If you're looking for a convenient place to lay your head in Palermo, I recommend Stupor Mundi. It's very convenient for anywhere in the old City with all it's numerous attractions, in particular the not to be missed archaeological museum, which is just behind the B&B. Stupor Mundi itself is very comfortable, and the staff couldn't be more friendly and helpful.","8496":"Very stylish and modern, we found the accommodation had everything we needed. It is close to the main railway station so that makes getting around the city really easy. We did not find many good places to dine nearby but we were a short ride on a bus to some great places. The snack bar next door is a good option though for breakfast, although Davide, the host, will provide breakfast if required. I would have given this B & B five stars, as it was great value for money, but we did find accessing it on our first night a bit daunting. It was late at night, and although there is an intercom to get into the block it is then a difficult to find your actual room on the third floor. But that is just our experience, I am sure if you arrive in the day you will have a whole different experience. This place is very good and excellent value for money,","8497":"I would like to thank Chiara and her assistant for the friendly manner and warm welcome given. Chiara also went out of her way to give us a map and highlight all the places of interest and local delicacies, they prepared a delicious breakfast for us every morning and was ever so obliging. I will not hesitate to highly recommend staying in this comfortable conveniently located B&B. It was very convenient for us from the ferry terminal to walk to the B&B, and also to visit the city centre","8498":"A perfect place to stay in Palermo\r Davide the host was excellent, very friendly and made good recommendations for food and places to see\r Very clean modern and stylishly furnished and decorated\r The breakfast served in the room was superb, everything really fresh and an extensive range of options\r We had the junior suite and the spa bath was great after a busy day sightseeing, very romantic and recommended\r Good local facilities, five minutes from the train and bus station, a great local bakery and an artisanal deli, both within a hundred metres of the flat\r Great cafe on the corner for beer coffee and wine and they do excellent and great value sandwiches, again with top quality local produce, but go before it shuts at 18.00. We missed out one day by five minutes....\r Highly recommended","8553":"We stayed at this b&b 4 nights. The room was really nice, comfortable and very clean with really nice breakfast. It's very close to the city center. The staff were courteous and willing to help. The only bad thing is that in my room i didn't have a good internet connection. We totally recommend it.","8559":"Very unhelpful and unfriendly. Felt like all they want is your money and nothing else. Not prepared to be helpful or flexible. Be careful and only book this place if you really only need somewhere to sleep and not bothered about anything else","8560":"Good roomy,well appointed only downside was that the bathroom rather dusty under large sink unit and we were there for 3 nights!.Breakfast was good and the staff efficient, could sit in a quiet bar for a drink but furniture arrangement could have been grouped to enable talking rather than longways like a waiting room.","8565":"B & b Federico Secondo is in a good location when you find it. The streets are amazingly narrow, even by Italy Sicily standards. Palermo streets are filled with trash and cats roam the trash - it\u2019s very distracting and totally took away from our visit. Upon arrival at the B&B, the person who answered the bell seemed very irritated to be disturbed, even though we arrived during our designated time. The B&B smelled strongly of mold. The room we were directed to was clean and looked out onto a stuccoed blank wall. The breakfast was plentiful and you were able to help yourself to anything but coffee. Palermo was so trashy that we chose to leave two days early, so this did not turn out to be a good value for us since the property did not offer to refund any days or ask if there was a problem. It was worth it to us to leave Palermo!","8567":"The B&B was very central location for all of Palermo's delights. Breakfast made very welcome and their was a good variety of breakfast food. A large bedroom with a very comfortable bed and a large bathroom with a large walk-in shower and a powerful shower.","8569":"Spent three nights at Bed and Breakfast Federico Secondo. Most comfortable and spacious room. Well located only a few minutes away from the Cathedral. Great hospitality and yum breakfast. Lovely decor and artworks. All in all just what I wanted for this break.","8578":"The first time I stayed in Palermo, it was near the Piazza Marina, about 14 years ago. You did not get an accurate picture of the city in that neighborhood. But arriving at Federico Secundo, after easily parking nearby, was a revelation: the Duomo and nearby marvels are a few steps away. The location cannot be beat. It was a bit disconcerting that no one answered the door (we arrived about 2PM). However there was a number to call, and we got the code to enter. While those running the B+B are not overly gregarious, they are correct enough. Breakfast is okay without being memorable; the fresh filtered coffee was fine. As was the room. Factoring in the affordable price, this B+B was a pleasant surprise.","8581":"Nestled in the dirty back streets of Palermo this clean, modern B and B is the perfect base to explore.  Fantastic amenities and an ample breakfast give you the perfect start to the day. We cannot recommend highly enough!","8585":"My husband and I stayed here as we wanted to be able to stay close to the Norman Palace and Palatine Chapel. It was an easy to walk to this area and several other historical sites. The hotel is narrow and our room only had one small window that opened into a central courtyard. One evening it was warm and no breeze came through. There is parking available in a dirt lot just south of the hotel. Space is limited so cars and very close to one another. The breakfast was good the manager made us special coffee each morning.","8587":"This perfect location had all we needed for our stay in Palermo. Simple B&B, very clean, breakfast was fresh and many choices to choose from. You do not need a car IF you stay here, just good walking shoes. Great restaurants and all major historical museums within 10-15 min walk! Definitely would stay again.","8607":"We spent 6 nights here. The location is spot on for the centre of everything in Palermo. We could walk to all the attractions and only used a taxi to get to the catacombs. This family owned B&B is very clean, the breakfast selection is good and delicious coffee. Vincenzo was very helpful. We were worried about our taxi back to the airport and he kindly chased this up for us. An excellent B&B for exploring Palermo on foot.","8609":"Enjoyed our stay here, owner very helpful, provided gluten free option for breakfast which was nice. Breakfast was very good. Room nice and spacious. Location is within walking distance of everything. Would definitely recommend.","8653":"Even the word amazing is not enough to describe our stay in this B&B! The host was there every morning to welcome us with delicious things for the breakfast (she asks before about what you eat and does the shopping accordingly -- her home-made tiramisu was astonishing!!) and giving us hints, maps, etc. depending on our program of the day. For example, when we were planning to visit the valley of the temples, she advised us another day (too hot) and which parking to take. She also gave us very good hints about restaurant in the area for lunch and dinner. The B&B is very clean and in a quiet area and we had no problems to park the car next to it every day. After 5 minutes walking you're at the beach and there are some toys that you can borrow from the B&B and even umbrellas if you don't want to rent them at the beach. All in all, that was our best stay in the 2 weeks of our Sicily trip and we're planning for sure to stay again at this B&B in a future trip.","8672":"I find Sferacavallo is a good stategic place when u come to Sicily, close to airport and Palermo. And by the sea is not so crowded in summer. Landscape, sea and mountain views are very beautiful too. We were staying in this apartments for 2 weeks days with my sister and niece. In our first rooms was no AC in bedrooms. We didn't get why. It was hard to get quality sleep, very hot and the windows were not possible to open cs of noise and smells from the streets.  But most shocking for me was the rubbish problem, lack of ECO awarness and ignorance...Even through apartments itself were ok clean, during our first week no one passed by to ask if we are ok, or take away the rubbish, change the bad sheets. When we ask wt to do with rubbish answer was: go have a look for a container on a street, preferably In the evening...or if it's very small quantity, leave in in -1 level. I am not a fun of writing bed reviews and tried to stay positive till the end. But when we had to go to the sea every single day and see all this rubbish and dog poop on the streets, plastic in the sea. Common guys just wake up! Especially if u are in tourism business! To think: it's not my problem, I didn't ruin the nature. Does not work cs as long as u ignore this problem u do ruin it together with your business. WAKE UP up and take responsibility for your service, wt u do with rubbish, and wt is around your hotel. There are plenty things u can do. Put at list container for plastic and help your guest get rid of trash. Organise beach cleaning, whatever. And to do so, keep your place clean, be friendly and helpful for the guests, give a good service for the money they pay - it's NORMAL. The best advise for people better go to Sardinia where is same climate but clean or to Greece where for same money you get a proper service and amazing, honest heart hospitality. Or if u decided for Sicily, the best way is if u have friends there or make sure all the important details are clear.","8683":"Very nice place to stay, exceptional sea view, and private terrace. Sferracavallo is just 10 min from Palermo by car and Vincenzo is a very nice and welcoming host. Recommended for short and longer stays. Will definitely book again next time.","8691":"The view of the ocean is five star and front row, and is always there for you from the beautifully tiled roof deck at this location. Our apartment was perfectly clean and stocked with useful kitchen utensils for cooking. The close proximity to excellent restaurants is great for going out to diner at night, which we did next door at the Antique Ristorante. Walking home after a glass of vino is convenient. The hot water and water pressure in the shower was always consistent. I appreciated the cheerful decor which included art on the walls in our large bedroom, which also had a balcony. Highly recommended as a destination holiday!! We will return with family and friends for years to come.","8695":"Close to the airport, excellent if you arrive late at Sicily and need a place to spend the first night (or the last one). Clean and spacious rooms. Arriving late will give you an extra fee. Waking up near the coast, in the centre of this small town, is a perfect way to start your Sicily trip. Parking might be a challange.... breakfast is perfect.","8701":"A great holiday apartment with a beautiful view of the sea. My room was upgraded (at cost) to a sea view apartment when I arrived and the host was very helpful. The apartment was really well furnished and even had a washing machine. However the cooker didn't work for the first two days and it was quite loud at night due to the location. A really great find!","8725":"At the risk of quoting another Trip Advisor from 2011, this paragraph sums it up: We paid more (and cash only) for this place than most B&Bs we stayed in around the island that had a lot more to offer (charm, warm host, nice breakfast, etc). This apartment is not in a nice area and is not good value for money. This felt like a bait and switch operation altogether. Per printed itinerary Sea View Exclusive for 2 people. (Expedia Itinerary -- Sorry TripAdvisor). Upon arrival, firstly NO ONE was at the property (even though it was only 4:30 p.m. when we'd arrived) and after numerous attempts to reach owner by phone, we finally got a call back on our cell. After half-hour wait in the car (which is DIFFICULT to find a parking spot for, by the way -- parking at a premium!) shown the apartment which not only was NOT a Sea View it was merely a SMALL BEDROOM -- NOT an apartment -- with the view of an ALLEY. Sea View Apartment which THOUGHT was originally booked was MORE MONEY. All transactions by the way are in CASH ONLY....so don't arrive without visiting the Bancomat first -- suspicious? As for the apartment, it was adequate, but contained no soap for bathing, and little else in the way of the creature comforts we'd found all through our travels in equally-priced B&Bs throughout our visit of Sicily till then. Since we never saw the owner again, we were unaware of a Continental Breakfast even if offered at extra cost -- no communication after our arrival whatsoever. Continuing, although adequately clean, the shower stall was questionable on it's cleanliness (wish I'd brought my shower thongs), and after walking barefoot in the apartment for awhile, noticed my feet to be quite dirty on the bottoms. These things may not be daunting to most -- and I honestly don't consider myself prudish in any way -- but when paying MORE MONEY for what you originally booked, one would think the price would reflect the accommodation. Think again and book elsewhere!","8730":"Io e la mia ragazza siamo stati tre notti in questa sistemazione. Ci \u00e8 piaciuta in quanto \u00e8 perfetta se non si vuole stare a Palermo citt\u00e0 (Sferracavallo \u00e8 un adorabile villaggio di pescatori appena fuori Palermo), \u00e8 strategicamente un'ottima zona, piena di locali e posti per mangiare. Carina la terrazza all'ultimo piano dove si pu\u00f2 osservare un bel panorama. Ok il Wi-Fi, non c'\u00e8 il parcheggio gratuito e angolo cottura come scritto nella descrizione. Due nei: non c'erano shampoo e bagnoschiuma (e se si va in vacanza non si ha voglia di andare in giro a supermercati!), e il ritardo nella consegna della stanza (40 minuti). Per il resto tutto bene, Vincenzo ci ha dato alcune dritte su cosa vedere e fare. P.s. La colazione si fa ad un bar vicino, il che va bene. Ma sarebbe carino poterla avere all'interno del locale. Me and my girlfriend have been three nights in this accommodation. We did like it as it's perfect if you don't wanna stay in Palermo city centre (Sferracavallo is a lovely fishermen village just outside Palermo), it's logistically a perfect place to stay, with plenty of places where you can eat. Very nice the terrace at the last floor where you can enjoy a very beautiful view. Ok the free wifi, but there's no free parking or cooking facilities as described. Two minus: there was no shampoo nor shower gel (you don't wanna go to the supermarket when you are on holiday!), and the delayed check in (40 min).Apart from this everything was ok, Vincenzo gave us good tips on where to go and what to see. P.s. You will have breakfast at a bar in the nearby. It would be nice to have it inside the accommodation","8737":"Stayed here late September on the occasion of my son's wedding and we hired the whole establishment for a week..great staff-who were very helpful-thoroughly enjoyable. The Building itself is an architects dream full of artworks. Very nice rooftop terrace with pool and views of the port. Highly recommended","8744":"L'Hotellelrie is definitely an amazing place to stay. Our rooms were bright spacious and quirky, the continental breakfast was great and the location just right. Do make sure you make a note of the entry password provided as there is no reception and you will need this to enter the building. We would definitely recommend.","8747":"What a hidden gem! Part of the old historic wall,near to the old town with a sea view to watch the boats go by lies the beautiful lovingly restored 16th century boutique hotel.\r We knew that we were in for a treat when reading other people's reviews but we were blown away!\r The whole experience from start to finish was exceptional. We were met at the airport by their personal driver Adriano who definitely deserves a mention as he gave us the wealth of his knowledge on Palermo and the surrounding areas and was most charming and informative. He also does personal tours and I would highly recommend him.\r We were met at reception by the most smiley of faces, the owner, the lovely Fresia. We were taken to the most beautiful courtyard for welcome drinks and pastries, what a great 'first impression' We had an extremely early flight arrival but they had still managed to have our room ready, impressive eh!\r Our room was light and spacious and the beds were very comfortable. We looked out to sea and we were over a restaurant which we thought could be noisy but it wasn't at all and we were there at the hight of season! In fact that just added to the charm. The common rooms were delightful as was all the interior, most tastefully designed by the present owner. The breakfasts were delicious with fresh warm pastries, croissants and homemade cake as well as all the usual fare! Rita was there to help at breakfast and she makes a mean good cappicuno!\r You could choose to have breakfast inside or out in the delightful courtyard. There are only a few rooms so it's very personalised and you can easily chat with the other guests if you so wish as we did! There was also a really nice small pool and relax terrace which was never busy and most welcome after a hot day sight seeing!\r Any advise on where to go the lovely Fresia was there to help at breakfast.\r Palermo is a fabulous place and all the locals we met were so friendly! I can't recommend it enough and as for L'Hotellerie and all its staff, I would gladly give it an11 out of 10 if I could.\r I will most definitely be coming back and I won't hesitate to let all my family and friends know about this stunningly charming place! Love it, love it, love it!","8750":"Probably the best B&B we have stayed at. Very clean and beautifully decorated and great location near the old town and the harbour. We very spontaneously left one night earlier because we went to stay with some friends living in Sicily and even got a price reduction for that night. Thanks again for your understandig. We would stay here again any time.","8753":"We booked the entire L'Hotellerie for a 3 night stay for my parent's 50th Golden wedding anniversary and this place exceeded our expectations. My brother dealt with Rita and Frejia for all the details and nothing was too much trouble. everything was answered quickly and efficiently by Whatsapp from us who were living in UK, LA, San Francisco and Toronto!\r The Hotel is made up of 8 separate suites where there is at least 1 king size bed, ensuite done to very high spec - the pictures really are a true reflection of the outstanding quality and class throughout the hotel. There were 22 of us, 6 families (12 teenagers!) and all accomodated brilliantly without feeling like we were on top of each other.\r We were provided with a lovely, fresh continental breakfast every morning with local fruits, juices, meats, cheeses and salads.\r We were able to arrange transfers through the hotel and our driver, Adriano, was amazing. Very knowledgeable, always smiling and warm and kind. Unfortunately we didn't have enough time but I would highly recommend him for any local sightseeing & excursions needed around Sicily.\r for food, the restaurant directly outseide the hotel - Il Gardo, had excellent pasta and fresh fish. The gelato is also highly recommended.\r there is a beach about 10 mins walk away, however, you are better off going to the nearby Mondello beach - about 10 mins drive away.","8755":"L'Hotellerie is a wonderful small hotel with a view of the water and easy access to Palermo's Old Town. The rooms are large and spacious and there are several common areas to enjoy. The breakfast is great with a wide variety of items and the staff are friendly and helpful. Fresia is very easy to work with and checked in with us to introduce herself and see if we needed anything. The location is perfect - there is a gelato place right outside the front door as well as a fish restaurant pizzeria. The staff at the restaurants were very friendly and the food was excellent. Parking was not a problem. We always found an empty spot on the street right in front of the hotel. I highly recommend L'Hotellerie!","8768":"This Hotel has recently changed its name to L' H\u00f4tellerie Easy Suites.. It has been cancelling pre-existing confirmed older bookings which were made at a cheaper rate.. but you can still book these rooms at a vastly inflated price?... It seems like their new affiliates are demanding a premium and to hell with trusting early booking customers?","8790":"Great location, beautiful building and comfortable room. Gorgeous common areas. We have stayed at a number of top end hotels in Sicily and this was one of the best in terms of value for money. A great place for combining visiting and living the city with relaxing in a tranquil setting. Freesia gave us great tips on where to eat.","8795":"Let me make it easy\u2026 if you can stay there do it. They have it all. Lovely, tastefully decorated environment, oversized rooms and great common spaces. Their breakfast is amongst the best. Their location is as central as you can make it while avoiding the narrow streets that suffocate other places downtown Palermo. Right outside the hotel are all type of food and gelato vendors if you did not make a reservation elsewhere. Right in front of the hotel, close to the Mediterranean is also where all the Palermo events - fireworks and music celebrations - can be enjoyed within a 10 minutes walk. Most other events are all within walking distance. Their rooftop \u2013 with a pool and many chairs and sofas \u2013 is available all the time. We use it for group dinner with food that was delivered from the vendors right outside the hotel. But what separates them from others is their SERVICE. Want advice on where to find the best beaches? Looking for a great guide? Want to book a nice car with a driver for the day? Even better\u2026 want to find last minutes tickets for a Beatles-Symphony concert that was fully booked? Just ask\u2026 we did all that. In summary if you want a place to help you discover the renaissance that old Palermo is undergoing\u2026 stay at l\u2019Hotellerie.","8802":"Everything was excellent, the room was spacious, clean, comfortable. The villa is within easy walking distance of the beach and San Leone. The breakfasts were very varied and a real experience to enjoy. Adriana has a real desire to help you get the most out of your stay, with advice, books and literature all about the loal area. I cannot recommend this enough. Our main reason for coming was to see the Valley of the Temples, which this is ideally situated for, but there is so much more to see here, I wish we could have stayed longer.","8819":"My husband and I have just returned from our visit to Palermo with our two daughters (10) and (14). Having stayed integrated beautiful Mondello for a few days we decided to stay in Palermo itself to take in all of the sites of the city. We booked at the last minute and Fresia the owner could not have been more helpful giving us advice on every detail about her wonderful property.\r \r Arriving at the property which is situated on an ancient street we were given a very warm welcome and shown around the very large villa. The lounge area and breakfast room were very large and welcoming with very nice furnishings. Fresia has very nice taste. The terrace area is perfect for enjoying a few hours away from the sightseeing. You will look out at the sea with sun loungers and comfortable chairs and a small pool which was perfect for our girls! We got caught out with some light rain while we were enjoying the terrace but it wasn\u2019t a problem as we were able to use the very comfortable orangery on the terrace where we were able to take shelter and still enjoy the amazing views.\r \r We stayed in the suite with sea view. We had our own staircase off the common rooms which made the room very private. The room was very large and spacious with everything we could possibly need. A proper hairdryer, towels changed as you need, a great mini fridge. The team are also very happy to help with anything else that you may need. The bathroom was also very large and with two teenage girls we were very grateful of the space.\r \r The entire property is cleaned and taken care of impeccably. We could not fault any single detail. The card and quality followed through every detail of the property even down to the perfect weight duvet with quality cotton sheets.\r \r Breakfast was an absolute treat again showing the quality of every detail has been considered. The food was freshly prepared every day and was of excellent quality. Be sure to have the cappuccino here the lady who makes the breakfast is extremely helpful and makes THE best cappuccino you will find! Fresh juicy oranges are provided so that you can make yourself a delicious fresh orange juice, we aren\u2019t lucky enough to have oranges this good in England. Fresh bread, cheese, meats, pastries and some other home made treats were more than we could have hoped for.\r \r The location is perfect. While you are at the hotel you can enjoy the peace and quiet in the house and sea view of the rooms and terrace. When you want to go sight seeing you are a walk away from all of the main sights and great restaurants. There are plenty of great places to eat out. You even have a pizzeria under the property where you can have a pizza large enough to share for just a few Euro\u2019s or enjoy some of the great fish restaurants just a few minutes walk away.\r \r We will definitely visit again!","8826":"My friend and I had a lovely trip here at the end of September. Unfortunately there were no twin rooms but the owner let us have the bigger family book with two double beds. The room was gorgeous (although low ceilings so you have to be careful!). The pool was very small but the terrace was lovely. Breakfast was great and the hotel arranged for us to be picked up and taken back to the airport with Adriano -who was also very helpful. There is a restaurant and bar with terrace right outside the hotel which is great if you arrive late and want to grab a quick drink - or some octopus !","8831":"We decided to change our trip plans and spend a night in Palermo so ourboys could see the Opera dei Pupi (Sicilian Puppet show). We found this lovely B&B which is a beautiful Palazzo in a very convenient location. The owner was so kind, warm, welcoming and helpful! She gave us excellent recommendations for local food and shopping. The common areas are absolutely gorgeous! Beautiful artwork and furnishings! It is truly something out of Elle Decor magazine! We were lucky to get the last room open that night as they've been booked since they opened. All of the details were wonderful from the tasteful welcome basket with notebook, fabric shopping tote and local snacks to the soft, inviting bedding and the decor! It is lovely! We will absolutely stay there again when we return to Palermo. We wish we could have stayed longer! Highly, highly recommend!","8854":"A cosy apartment in the heart of Palermo. Launched one year ago by Vincenzo that is welcoming you explaining all the apartment details with passion and professionalism. Everything is OK : clean, nice furniture, safe, spacious bathroom and a powerful WiFi. Breakfast is explained by Giorgia and is just perfect with products coming from the Sicilian countryside. We also appreciated the electronic key to enter the building, apartment and room. We will be back!!","8856":"A wonderful welcome by the charming owner ( you should get in touch before arrival so she can be there when you come). Very nice cosy warm room ( in January), with excellent double windows isolation from the street nearby. The breakfast was rich with local products and all the personnel is so friendly you have the impression you have always belonged there. A must in Agrigento !","8858":"We enjoyed this place. The owner was very kind. On arrival, we lost our way close to the B and B and asked the person at the front desk of another hotel for directions. He called the Portaenea owner on our behalf, who came in his car and guided us to a parking lot close to the B and B. Happy ending, it could have been a lot more frustrating and time consuming. The place is pleasant, the room large and well furnished. The breakfast was on a lovely terrace with a view over the valley nearby including the Valley of Temples. The location is right on the main pedestrian street where there are lots of restaurants, but we did not find it too noisy. The pillow were lumpy and uncomfortable and could do with being replaced for new more comfortable modern ones.","8859":"This accommodation is part of an apartment building in a very central location.There is a lift and security to get in. The owner is very helpful with local information,he will make phone calls for you,arrange taxis,recommend restaurants.We were able to walk to meet day tours from here.The bus stop is very close by.Our room was spacious,clean and tasteful.Breakfast was Sicilian and tasty.I would recommend this cosy place.","8861":"We stayed at Kalamonjo for a week. I must say its one of out best experiences. Vincenzo the owner and Georgia is really taking care of the guests. We felt very welcomed and cared. The breakfast (which some parts is home made) is fantastic. We can warmly recomend staying in Kalamonjo when visiting Palermo and you will have the best stay you could had. Thank you Vincenzo and Georgia. Best regards Robin & Amina","8864":"Not sure i have anything bad to say about that b&b, staff were very friendly, room was very comfortable, the terrace had an amazing view, had a lil glass of prosecco while watching the sun go down on the temples.... well thats amazing.  And breakfast is served up on the terrace wonderfull view again.  Great location as just in the centre, and just a little walk away from anywhere....","8865":"You will definitely feel welcomed to the Kalamonjo B&B! The host Vincenzo is most attentive and friendly host you can expect. Vincenzo gave us good tips for restaurants and place to visit and did take his time to mark his suggestions on a good map.  Special thanks for the great breakfast. Love it! Every morning fresh fruits, organic yogurt, fresh pane integrale, juicy marmalade and fantastic spremuta = fresh orange juice.  Rooms are very clean and relatively spacious. Good shower! The location offers easy access to all main attractions. There are good restaurants in the neighborhood, yet the popular bars have an impact on the noise level during the night.  I recommend warmly for couples and for families with teens.","8866":"We spent 4 nights here and so glad we did. The B&B has a perfect location, at the beginning of the Via Athena. Sandra and Phillip are very kind and helpful people. The rooms are very comfortable and clean with romantic details. Delicious Breakfast was served on the roof terrace with the view of Temples and sea. This is a wonderful place to stay and we are so happy to recommend. Hope to see you again.","8898":"This is well placed for the centre and links to the airport bus, and the station is walkable  The building is very attractive with liberty era art throughout. And staff are friendly  However our room wasnt great, feeling like one squeezed in. It was quite small with a weirdly high ceiling. The tiny bathroom was an after thought.  Breakfast too was well below par with limited choices, and no restocking  It's not a surprise to see signs for awards from 2013 and none since. I wonder if they think its a gallery with rooms","8902":"We spent our last night in Sicilia at this small lovely hotel with very good price. It was a perfect choice: close to the main interest places in Palermo city in a good neighborhood: market and restaurant quite besides. There is a parking lot for 18 Euros (it was written 15 Euros at Expedia but the Receptionist in the morning said it was an old price), anyway it worthed a lot since you let your car safe, a driver comes to pick it up (check in) and wherever you want (Its 24 hours paid, if you cone 5 pm and even the check out is 11 am you can get your car at 5 pm). We tried to drive to some sightseeings and after 40 minutes without a place to park the car we got back to the hotel to leave our car again at this parking (without pay it again, so we got the car till 5 pm). And we could WALK to all sightseeings :ok_hand: ABOUT the hotel: Small room (Standard) with VERY good air conditioner (very important!), good bed, nice shower and a refrigerator BUT the best thing was MARIELLA at RECEPTION: The most simpatic italian person we have seen on these 8 months traveling all round Italy :smiling_face_with_three_hearts: She is a very good professional, gives all attention and directions, i saw her talking in english to a small group of chinese i think and now before we left (we left our cooler on electricity till we came to the Porto to get our Traghetto to Genova) we saw a BIG group of Korean women who barely spoke english and she had all patience (SO difficult issue for italians :joy:) and also made mimics to help on comunicazione :clap:????:clap:????:clap:????. She was alone, if not i am sure she could help these ladies with their luggage. We LOVED the breakfast, liked also this staff (all them very kind, the barista girl) and the cleaning staff. Surely we recommend this hotel !!!","8903":"We visited Agrigento in early October as part of our trip to Sicily and stayed for two days at this lovely b&b. An excellent location, close to all major sights in the city and the bus and train stations. An excellent clean and tastefully decorated room with an ensuite bathroom. Efficient service: the owner Sandra and her assistant are very helpful. Sandra answered all our questions regarding our visit and places to see and gave many useful tips to make our visit pleasant and unforgettable. In addition, the b&b has a lovely roof terrace where breakfast is served. Sandra also encouraged us to use it at any other time we wished, which is an exceptional thing as in most b&b's this is not the case. In general, a very good room and service for the price we paid. If we ever came back to Agrigento, Portatenea would be our choice for accomodation.","8904":"Great hotel close to both local and inter town buses and train station. Excellent room and great breakfast served on terrace overlooking town and temples. Hotel sited at start of upmarket street with shops and restaurants. Helpful and friendly staff and owner","8917":"For the 3rd year I spent most of July at hotel Joli. So nice to be welcomed back by the same faces in the staff team. Always excellent service, great location and facilities. The in house training room is spacious and convenient.","8919":"The hotel is old but in a good position to access the old town. You can drive to the Hotel without having to worry about the ZTL or other restrictions. They have parking in the streets, but we chose to pay EUR15.00 and parked in the Hotel car park. The rooms are a good size and we had a large balcony. The shower is small with average water pressure. The bed wasn't the most comfortable, but it had good a c. It is a quiet part of town and we did not hear any street noise. The breakfast was charming and they make fresh coffee for you at your request. All of the staff that we dealt with were very friendly and helpful. They gave us a map and suggested the must see options in the old town. There are many restaurants close by. An enjoyable stay.","8927":"Very happy with service and location. Good room and very nice hotel. I will return next time same hotel. The breakfast was quite good. Very clean and staff always helping. I enjoyed a lot the four days spent there","8928":"Excellent location, good restaurants, shops, monuments are only five min walk from this excellent value hotel. The staff is friendly, super polite and accomodating. Good breakfast, but lacks fruit. The water pressure in the bathroom was poor, but very clean. Would return.","8934":"With my Boyfriend for 5 days. Great location for business or pleasure. Sweet and delicious breakfast with some healthy options as well. Lovely and efficient cleaning staff. Great folks working breakfast room. Some front staff great. The woman was an airhead. Everyone else was great. Hotel very clean and room spacious. Thank you.","8939":"Can't rate this hotel high enough. Fantastic location. Really friendly staff and a wonderful junior suite with a ceiling we just loved to wake up looking at. Great breakfast and lovely antique furniture. Just loved it all.","8941":"We stayed for four nights in a lovely room with two balconies and great decor. The hotel is in a great situation to walk to the main points of interest. The room was very clean and towels were changed each day. We used the private parking at \u20ac15 a day for our hire car and they brought the car to the door when we needed it. The breakfast was a bit basic with a selection of cheese, meat and pastries but no fresh fruit.","8945":"A really nice hotel decorated in Italian style. Added to the cultural experience. The staff were friendly & helpful, the rooms comfortable and the hotel has a good location, relatively short walks to the sights, coast and restaurants   nightlife. The only reason I didn\u2019t give it 5 stars was because of the breakfast, generally tasted a bit stale and funky.  Palermo itself was okay, with some nice buildings dotted about, the highlight probably being the Mafia museum (learned a lot). The restaurants were superb, amazing food and wine. As a city it\u2019s just a bit run down, coast line within walking distance is like a building site, the pavements were awful everywhere (couldn\u2019t easily wheel your bag on it) and excrement all over the place.","8952":"On school trip from Denmark. stayed there for 2 days. Nice working air-conditioning. Very nice staff and very good breakfast with freshly brewed coffee. The wifi on the first floor was not soo good, but the connection on the other floors worked perfectly. Even though the hotel is located in the city there was not a lot of noise from the streets. Overall very nice hotel, although some of the windows did not close all the way.","8958":"We really enjoyed our stay in this hotel. Pros -the location- it\u2019s very near the center of the city -beautiful view -the room was ok, clean, they changed the towels daily -the breakfast was delicious -the staff is really helpful and nice  Cons-: the hairdryer needs improvement, it\u2019s very old and difficult to use. You can changed them  But a very pleasant stay. We recommend this hotel.","8960":"Comfortable hotel close to all the amenities, some nice views and walks in the local area.  Located close to Rimini and any MotoGP fans will be well located for Tavullia, Coriano and Misano.  Historic sites to visit in the area include the disused railway in the town centre car park next to the hotel.  The hotel is comfortable and clean but no restaurant, very helpful staff and great if you\u2019re on a budget.","8977":"My husband and I stayed here in Oct and enjoyed it very much. We had a superior double room which was a good sized room that said Italy to me. It\u2019s not a chain hotel, but has its own charm. Furnishing is old world. The first surprise was opening the door to our room, looking up and finding a beautiful ceiling. Comfortable room. Great location.","8981":"We enjoyed this place very much. Located in the city centre. Very cozy, with cat, breakfast terrace, every room has a balcony, special design. Nice breakfast prepared from the owner. Place where to return.","8985":"Hotel Joli is located only a few blocks away from the heart of old Palermo. The rooms are very clean and not too small. The elevator is extremely tight and although it says has a capacity for 3 persons this would only be the case for 3 very small people! We were on the 3rd floor and walked up and down the stairs instead. I counted - 92 steps! My biggest negative would be the breakfast. No fresh fruit, no fresh yogurt, but lots of pastries, meat and cheese. Even the juice was not fresh. Coffee was delicious however. Overall: Pros - clean, good coffee, comfortable room, great location. Cons: tiny elevator and sad breakfast.","9001":"the main reason for giving a 'very good' is the food in the restaurant in the evening. Very good! We had the mixed anti pasti to start with and a mussels 'soup' followed by pasta, all great. Very tasty and well prepared. The room was good, last one they had was a quad room which we took for the double price, so plenty of room to spread out. However - bed was squeaky, caterpillar on the shower floor, and a view over the rubbish filled empty plot next door, not exactly inspiring. Very devoid of any decoration as well, which made it feel very hollow inside. checking out was not good - all staff disappeared at exactly the time most of the guests wanted to pay their bills and get on their way. Attitude leaves a little to be desired, but we found that in a lot of places - brisk would be a polite way to put it - more like abrupt.","9009":"If I had to sum up this exceptional little B and B up in one word, it would be; CHARMING. Each quaint room is different from the last, the shared terrace and lounge areas are beautiful and extremely clean and every item of furniture, fixture and fitting, gove the impression that they have been personally selected for an authentic Sicilian feel. Despite the excellence of the building itself, it is perhaps the staff which are the greatest asset to this super little hideaway. They really could not be more helpful, ready to give local recommendations, including the most secure parking, fix any small issues and serve a delightful breakfast, all in impeccable English and with a genuine warmth and care for their guests. One member of staff even treated us to an impromptu piano recital during breakfast on the terrace (don\u2019t roll your eyes here, the man was genuinely talented). If you are in Palermo for a few days, or just passing through, this is the perfect spot! Certainly not one to be missed, especially at these prices! Highly recommended!","9014":"Family run place inside a nicely remodeled farm. Rooms are great, clean new and with aircon. However on a Saturday night the rooms facing the Restaurant patio are quite noisy. Food is great and reasonably priced, staff is very friendly. Parking widely available. 10 mins car drive to the temples, hence ideally located but also close to a local overpass highay. Highly recommended as base to visit the temples.","9020":"My husband and I stayed here in August 2018. The hotel has a great location! The hotel service was friendly, courteous, and very helpful. The only problem with the hotel was the room. The room was small, and the bed was uncomfortable. Our room was situated on the first floor, so we had lots of street noise. Hence this is why I gave it 3 stars.","9021":"Maurizio is a fantastic host with great communication. My friend and I only spent one night, arriving late at night and leaving early the next morning. The room was extra spacious and the bathroom is very clean. Highly recommend this place!","9022":"Back this year for another 4 weeks at Hotel Joli - the first imression is that they have retained the same staff from 12 months ago - which to me, is an excellent sign of good ownership and management. Everybody as always very friendly and most helpful. Breakfasts, as always are awesome, if no so good for the waistline - I was at Hotel Joli for training events - the facilities are excellent and spacious - with the fabulous terrace providing a great place for coffee breaks","9037":"Very cozy and romantic place...but in the middle of nowhere...it is far from the city...but in beautiful area. Rooms with balconies and nice view. In the evening you can book the table in restaurant- for 10\u20ac per person we had typical sicilian dinner with delicious homemade wine. In that place you can feel real Sicily! We recommend!","9040":"The apartement is great. It's very clean and the mixture between antique and the modern furniture Mauricio builds himself is amazing. The terrace is huge and wonderful, we loved the playful little cat Niccolo. Sometimes Mauricio plays the piano which is wonderful and Chiara is a wonderful warmhearted person who can give you recommendations for your stay. We even got a small breakfast with Croissant, capucciono and fruit. We would definitely come back again!","9045":"Nice location. Very clean. Quite. Good Price. Perfect located in the center of the town. Very very nice hosts. I felt very welcomed! Highly recommended. Every room is styled individually. Loved it. I will come back.","9048":"We had a wonderful stay in the tripleroom with my mother. Our room and the open kitchen area where we had breakfast were newly furbished, fresh and clean. The balcony this early in the spring (first week of April) was a bit cold but was a nice plus and probably excellent when it gets warmer. The bathroom is big and fresh, nice warm&thick towels and amenities. The arrival, the breakfast, the hints and tips and help with airport taxi were superb! Highly recommended place! If ever back in Palermo, we\u2019ll definitely be back at Real Fonderia B&B! Thank you Emanuela!!","9056":"Sadly, we did not actually stay at this agriturismo. We were trying to find another one where we had a reservation. We were desperate and drove up to this beautiful agriturismo to ask for directions. The front desk staff (who did not speak English) were so kind as to find our actual agriturismo online, call them for directions, and drive ahead of us to show the way to our actual reservation. As she left us, she said Welcome! in English. It was a wonderful gift to help us and she literally went far out of her way.","9061":"Sadly this Agriturismo was the worth accommodation on our round trip in Sicily. If you do not mind to sleep in a better backpacker hostel this agriturismo is ok. It is clean but nothing more. I did not see any home grown products, wine or anything else. Breakfast was more then poor standard. Dinner was good and reasonable. Stuff was nice but conversation in English, French or German was not really possible. I would not recommend this accommodation. Better take a b&b in agrigento downtown.","9080":"This is a lovely peaceful haven away from the hustle and bustle of Palermo. Despite being a few feet away from a busy street market which you must visit; once you\u2019re inside it is cool and quiet. We had a room with a spiral staircase in it leading up to a small roof terrace where we sat listening to music and enjoying the view of the hills and the Cathedral. Gigliola is a wonderful host, nothing is too much bother. This was my second visit to this B&B and I will definitely be visiting again when I\u2019m next in Palermo, which by the way is a fantastic city.","9087":"We spent four days here this month. The place was comfortable and homely. Loved it! Thanks to Gigliola for being a wonderful host. The location is great too, very central   close to Teatro Massimo and within walking distance of most central sights","9095":"Situated in a safe and central location. What makes it special though is the cleanliness and attention to detail of the manager. As a woman of colour on initially meeting her she made a comment which I found racially offensive. That said, I did not experience any further otherwise discrimminatory treatment or statements. She was attentive and professional through out. I would return and I would recommend the place to others.","9097":"Once we got the lay if the land it truly was a central location to all the major walking attractions and restaurants. We stayed two nights, B&B very clean, my only critique would be a daily change of towels and new pillows. The owner and staff very nice, helpful each morning a lovely continental breakfast.","9099":"We arrived here on 30th September for a one week holiday. The B and B is well located for access to all the main sights as it has a central location. The outside of the B and B looks nice but like any other building in the narrow streets around Palermo. But once you enter through the large doors the beauty of this B and B really starts to shine. The building is stunning! There is a elevator which is handy for both people with disabilities and also getting your luggage up to the rooms. The room we stayed in was very clean, spacious, and well presented. It had a table and chairs, an arm chair, TV and Fridge. The bathroom was good with enough room for two people but the shower was quite small and with myself being a large chap it was a little tight to move in it. The bed was nice and comfy and the pillow was good. The breakfast room is stunning, and as this once was a palace you can clearly see the character of this in here. The food was good with enough to fill the biggest of eaters. There is an outside area which is nice for relaxing after a day of exploring Palermo and its sights. There are plenty of places to eat, drink and to buy food to take away near the B and B. Gigliola is a wonderful host who will do her very best to make sure that you have a perfect time with her. She helped sort our missing luggage when KLM decided to leave it back in Rome. She is also able to arrange a private transfer from the airport for 35 euro.","9100":"I found this amazing b&b a couple of years ago and all I can say is that it keeps getting better with time! The location is perfect: practically round the corner of beautiful Teatro Massino and an array of lovely ristorantes and all kind of shops and also near most attractions. Leave the rental car in the nearby parking and even forget public transportation because everything is walking distance. The quaint street has street vendors offering all kind of goods and delicious food during the day and is extremely quiet in the evenings. The facade is unassuming but as soon as you get into Sant'Agostino you will be welcomed by Gigliola, who is the perfect host and will do everything to make you feel pampered and taken care of during your whole stay. The building was a palace built in the XV century carefully restored and tastefully decorated. The rooms are big and many of them have an adjacent room or living room, perfect for family and friends traveling together. Breakfast is unbelievably delicious and the dinning room's ceiling decorated with marvelous frescoes. There is a communal kitchen with everything you need if you want to grab a snack in between meals and a beautiful terrace, full of blooming flowers, comfortable chairs, the perfect spot to relax. And a lift so you don't have to carry the luggage up and down the stairs. What can I say about Gigliola? My friend Estela had an accident while visiting Capella Palatina and she broke her arm ... She had it immobilized at the hospital (the attention was out of this world and 100 % free, even though she had international health insurance, no cost whatsoever!) but Gigliola took care of every need and made her feel as if she was really at home. She made the difference and helped Estela with every detail, even getting a motorista so she could continue her journey. She certainly made the difference and we will be forever grateful. So no need to look further, Sant'Agostino is THE b&b in Palermo!","9150":"Really warm welcome, helpful owners. Magnificient place, I really recommend it. You get the touch of ancient Sicily, even if it is the less fancy side sometimes with poor but beutiful and happy people. You should see this city and its cats, streets, people.","9170":"Daniel at reception was very helpful, guiding us through( translating) the dinner menu, giving driving  parking advice for the valley of the temples and generally making us comfortable in the hotel. Breakfast was delicious - many choices and excellent quality. We really enjoyed our stay in this lovely hotel.","9178":"We were here just one night,15 1 2020, to see the temples. This is a very good option to stay, it is very close to the sites, and although walking distance, I suggest you drive there, there aren't really footpaths and by the time you have walked the complex, you might be glad of your car!! The hotel is very comfortable, the staff are lovely and we had a lovely room with clear views of the temples and the sea beyond. Worth it for that alone. We had dinner here, which was very good, again great staff. there are plenty of cafes and restaurants close by too, and parking onsite.I recommend this hotel very highly, we would stay here again.","9187":"We stayed in room 402. The elevators stop at the third floor. Then around the corner is a spiral staircase that leads to 402. It has an enormous terrace with an unobstructed view to the sea, and most of all, to the entire temple complex which is lit up at night. Beautiful! The room and bathroom seemed small, but all of our fellow travelers who came to take photos said our room and bathroom were larger than theirs. We cannot imagine how small the others are. If you want private outside space and a beautiful sunset over the sea and a mile of lit pathway between lit temples, this room is for you.","9196":"A pleasant place to stay in a large country side city in Scilly Good amenities and pleasant basic rooms. A nice garden setting overlooking some well preserved Greek Temples in a Valley. We went for a walking tour of these Temples which seem to go on and on but a pleasant tour;","9202":"This is a modern hotel conveniently located within walking distance of the Valley of Temples and the museum. The breakfast buffet offers Sicilian pastries, cheeses, and other items such as scrambled eggs with ham. The grounds are spacious with space to relax and enjoy a refreshment after a day touring. The room was excellent:clean and quiet. I ate both of my dinners there and was pleased with the quality and variety of choices. A word of advice: the restaurant opens at 7:30 for dinner but the staff is prepared for those waiting to get in. Plan ahead!","9204":"We had a very generously sized and comfortable room on the top floor and thus heard practically no street noise at all. The location is excellent - very close to the city centre. However, for all my fellow coeliacs out there: The hotel website and standard booking websites state that gluten free breakfasts are available, and they are. But you must make sure that you book this in advance. I thought I had, reception told me I hadn't and I couldn't provide any proof. The upshot was mainly pre-packaged cakes, which are not my favourite breakfast item, plus one bread roll. I had to ask for a second one every morning. This got a little annoying, particularly since one of Palermo's gluten-free shops is practically next door. So give them plenty of notice!","9208":"We were booked into this hotel on a group tour. The rooms are small, boxy and old fashioned and in need of refurbishment \u2013 our hairdryer was a very ancient tube type affair that had seen better days. All that being said, it was clean, comfortable and a very short car distance to the Valley of the Temples \u2013 so an excellent location (also close to a couple supermarkets \u2013 Penny Market up the road was excellent value). The gardens were also attractive and it was pleasant to sit there and look out across the valley. We found the staff to be helpful and pleasant and the meals, whilst not winning any awards, were pretty good. So, all in all in a good location for the major sights.","9210":"This 4-star hotel is a refined oasis perfectly located for an efficient visit to Agrigento's Greek Temples and Archeological Museum. We chose it for it proximity to those sites, its garden, on-site parking, elevator, and on-site restaurant. Since we drove in late, on-site dining was critical. Our attractive double had a fine bed, ample room, strong WiFi, and a great bath. Dinner (extra) and the free breakfast were excellent. The Garden was truly nice. We enjoyed it after dinner and again after breakfast. It provides a fine view of the Greek Temples and the sea beyond. Staff were efficient and professional. Great value for the money. I regret that we had to move on. It would have been nice to stay another night. We had trouble finding the hotel entrance in the dark. On-site parking was tight but a staffer was already sorting it out and found us space within minutes. Greatest strengths: room and garden.","9212":"We stayed at the Colleverde Park Hotel while on a group tour of Agrigento. The hotel is lovely and the view of the Valley of Temples lit up at night can't be beat! The hotel has beautiful gardens and open air bar. Hotel rooms were clean and spacious.  We had a group dinner here as well and the food was very good. My only and minor complaint was that the cappuccino machine was not working at breakfast.","9213":"We carefully selected this hotel for New Year 2020 holidays. We spent 7 nights in excellent condition. The room was quiet, very comfortable, large, neoclassical style, beautifully decorated( paintings, floor lamp, wall lamps, Italian marble floor), a slightly retro atmosphere very pleasant. A second smaller room was a dining room which included a well-equipped kitchenette, a table, 2 chairs, a sofa bed, a floor lamp, and paintings also. Cleaning was daily. The sheats and the towels were changed every day too, without asking. The breakfast was rich and varied. That included cannoli cakes that I knew the other 2 trips in Sicily and I liked them. As regards the hotel staff I could say: very professional and helpful. Congratulation for the hotel management, too Hotel location: very good. 5 minutes from the city (elegant)center(Teatro Massimo, Teatro Politeama, Via Ruggero Settimo) and not far from the historic center 15 minutes walking distance or 5 minutes by bus (station near the hotel)","9214":"We stayed at the Collaverde Park Hotel for one night. The hotel is in a great location just across the road from the Valley of the Temples. The garden is lovely and it\u2019s nice to sit out at night time and look at the amazing view. Unfortunately the rooms are a bit tired and need a facelift. The mattress in our room was very hard. The hotel did its job for us as we wanted a hotel near the monuments and with parking. I would recommend for that reason alone. The staff are all very nice and helpful too.","9222":"This is a great place for a group trip; the hotel is in a perfect location to enjoy Agrigento. If you want a super luxury experience this is not our place but Colleverde has a lovely garden to relax & enjoy the views. I have traveled Europe & this is a high quality tourist class hotel. The staff are super friendly & helpful. The breakfast is really great, drinks on the veranda are delightful. The cost is very reasonable. There aren\u2019t many options for hotels in Agrigento. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to stay at Valley of the Temples. Also I miss the staff they are very endearing.","9230":"Enjoyed our stay at the Residenza. Nice room and helpful staff. Really good value and an easy walk to the central sights in Palermo. Great restaurant recommended by the hotel - Osteria Lo Bianco - just around the corner . Local rather than tourist with exceptional food and wine.","9234":"We stayed for 6 nights and enjoyed our time at Residenza D'Arogona. The rooms are spacious, the hotel well located, and the staff friendly and helpful. But there are a few things you should know to maximise your enjoyment of this establishment. Some of the rooms are self contained with kitchenettes, but you have to pay e10 a night for the kitchen facility. If you choose not to do pay for the kitchen, you have no facilities in the room to make even a cup of tea. Also the internet was not strong in our room. We would happily stay there again and are happy to recommend it and endorse the positive comments of the other reviewiers.","9237":"The hotel seems not well maintained. Such a beautiful spot to be located yet the lustre has gone off the interior and the beautiful garden. Room was okay, but bedding seemed old and the duvets covers re-used. Beds were literally stone hard, impossible to get a good nights sleep. Breakfast was diverse and good. Dinner was well served but truly of less than good quality.","9238":"We stayed here as a family and were pleasantly surprised by the size of the rooms. We had booked a triple room, which in other places means 3 beds crammed into one small room but here we had 3 large rooms and a decent sized bathroom. Another surprise was the delicious breakfast included in the room price. A great selection of food, don't miss the homemade cannoli.","9243":"This is a comment only for restaurant.  We decided to have a dinner on its restaurant due to good comments. We did not enjoyed at all. It is very expensive compared to taste of meals and environment. There are near places thousand times better with same price. Moreover, when you eat inside (we didn't see any customer having dinner in terrace) you can't see any view of temples as it's said in other comments.","9244":"We booked a room for three adults and were allocated a balconied suite with a very large double bedroom and adjoining lounge kitchen are into which the third sofa-bed had been placed without reducing the available space to any significant degree. Hotel staff were efficient and helpful and continental breakfast was of good standard. The Reception is not manned at night but an outside key is provided for late returners. My only minor criticism was the shower which was a bit inconsistent between hot and cooler. Hotel location is excellent, being a few minutes from the major shops and the Teatro Massimo from which a crowded pedestrianised street, lined with bars, cafes and restaurants, leads down to the Old Town, Cathedral, Norman Palace and a vast food market. Sadly the road in which the hotel is located (like much of the rest of the city) is littered and graffiti daubed. I can\u2019t blame the hotel for this!","9245":"We spent 2 nights there. We booked a superior triple room. The room was very spacious, even considering 3 adults, comfortable beds, excellent breakfast, reliable wi-fi. The car can be parked nearby for 18 euros and valet service is included. Very helpful staff.Great location! We recommend this place","9259":"There is no down side of this hotel. Great location, walking distance to all main attractions (takes 10 min on the bus to train or bus station). Had a suit with microwave and refrigerator, a lot of space in the room, very modern room with a walk in balcony. Fast internet with enough english channels on TV. Breakfast was adequate too. I only wish that there would have been more space in the restroom. Highly recommend, particularly knowing how much I payed for it.","9264":"This hotel is so beautiful both inside and out. It is near to all the tourist sites and to downtown. It honestly seemed like paradise in their garden and restaurant overlooking the garden. The breakfast was excellent as well. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom had a jacuzzi tub. I highly recommend this hotel.","9265":"Not much to say that others haven't. Room was really big and spotless too. Plenty of hot water and the bathroom was a good size.  We didn't have any issues with times as our flight got us in just after 14:00 and we had to leave to catch our flight at 8:00.  The reception team were polite and helpful. They booked taxis for us.  I have stayed in Italy a few times in places like this and they're not hotels but more like b&bs. Bottom line if you want a hotel experience book a hotel. If you just want a clean place to lay your head this is fine.  The 'hotel' had everything I needed and I was happy with the room, the service and the price.","9266":"The position of this hotel so close to the temples was wonderful, especially as the restaurant looks across to the illuminated temples, making for a very atmospheric experience. Room spacious and light, and breakfast good.","9273":"Its a good hotel with very nice gardens. The staff is not very helpful.Its far away from the centre of Agrigento but from a short distance of Valley of Temple.In the breakfast buffet there is a little bit mess as they had a natural marmelade which was half empty and I thought it was an individual marmelade.So I brought it to my table then they told me you shouldnt bring this on your table. I didnt like that much.The service is a bit slow may be because they have staff not very young.The reception had quite helpful staff except one guy who was young.This guy told us when we arrived at I think 1.30 that the room was not ready. He offered us a caramel and I told him that I would prefer a drink. He said ok. We took these drinks for free and at the end we left our room he had charged us these drinks. I guess that he didnt understand.There was a misunderstanding may be he wanted to deceive us.","9281":"Hotel has lovely gardens and a nice view of the temples, particularly in the evening. Located about a mile from the temples, it is convenient but not that close. Rooms were clean and comfortable, breakfast was good and included in the room price. Food in the restaurant was good and the view is terrific.","9282":"We stayed here two nights and booked the Superior Double Room. It was huge, with a good sized bedroom, a large living area with table, chairs, spare bed and sofa, and a bathroom. We travelled on the overnight ferry from Naples and arrived at the hotel at 7am and were very grateful that our room was ready (we let them know we were arriving early). It was only about a fifteen minute walk from the ferry terminal and is also only two blocks away from the Free Shuttle Bus which was very handy for sight-seeing and for getting to the train station on the day we left. The included breakfast was good and the staff very friendly and helped me with my attempts at speaking Italian. Our only disappointment with the hotel was that the lifts weren't working during our stay and we were on the fourth floor. This didn't really bother us, although as we arrived early in the morning it would have been nice for them to offer us breakfast as compensation for this. Otherwise, can highly recommend this hotel.","9284":"The Residenza d'Aragona is spotlessly clean. The rooms are enormous, with couches, four seater table, and an enormous bed. Plenty of storage space.  The common seating area off reception are comfortable. There is a lift to all floors. Luggage storage is available on day of check out. WiFi is faultless. Air Con is in perfect working order. Reception and housekeeping staff are all extremely accommodating.  The property has a two set down car spaces outside the entrance for your limo   taxi pickups   drop offs and CPO team vehicles. The reception is secured 24 7 with one internal locked door on buzzer from 7am to 11pm when reception is manned. After 11pm two locked doors secure the property and access between 11pm and 7am is via keys issued to you by reception on arrival. Doors to rooms are like bank vaults and my room was noise free - no other room noises and no street noise.  The property is the perfect base for the Arab-Norman sites of Palermo and most of the sites are within walking distance for those who like a pleasant walk - the Cathedral(s), the Norman Palace also the Opera, the docks, the shopping district are all within easy walking distance. There are many bars, cafes, restaurants, tobacconists, and grocery stores within a couple of hundred metres of the location.  The taxi fare from Palermo airport to the property is between 65EUR and 85EUR depending on various factors including time of day, amount of luggage, and whether your drivers meter is on the fiddle. The ride is 20-30 minutes depending on time of day.  The taxi ride to Mondello Beach (which is beautiful) is between EUR25 and EUR35 - the reception will arrange one for you. There is also a bus to Mondello Beach - the 603 - I note there is some confusion about this on some sites. Its about a 45 minute ride.  Note to those going to Mondello Beach by taxi. The taxi ride is 20 minutes or so. Make sure you arrange with the outgoing taxi to pick you up for return or get the number of a firm of taxis. You will struggle to hail a taxi on the street in Mondello. There is a taxi rank but I never saw one there. Also if Palermo FC are playing at home then be aware that you will struggle to get back to the city using the normal route after 6pm for evening games as the stadium is on the Palermo - Mondello main route and roads close for match days.  The taxi rank in Mondello Beach is opposite the bus terminus for Mondello which has a frequent service to all areas and the city.  The taxi rank and bus terminus are on the opposite side of the road to the section of private beaches at Mondello where you pay circa 14EUR for entry for two beds and an umbrella rather than using the public beach. Card readers are issued for entry and on returning them you receive a 2EUR refund. These beaches close at 7pm. They have showers, changing rooms, toilets, bars, and snack bars with full access to the crystal clear waters of Mondello Beach for which it is famous.  For excellent coffee, freshly squeezed orange juice, snacks, pasta, and salads give Bar Da Dominik a try on the square around the corner - 5 minutes walk. Also La Duchessa is the best for huge Sicilian salads and pizzas (pics below).  Smokers note: the tobacconists close at 10pm and unless you have an Italian National ID Card then the machine will keep your money and issue a receipt after a long delay for a refund at a shop.  Cannot comment on breakfast at the property as I did not have any.  Enjoy!","9288":"5 star service in a 3 star hotel. Excellent and super helpful staff. From sightseeing to restaurant suggestions, they were excellent. Room was spacious and lovely and views of the temples. Excellent restaurant for both breakfast and dinner. Very well run hotel.","9290":"The best thing about this hotel is the gardens - a lovely place to sit and enjoy a drink (although the bar doesn't open until 5pm) with stunning views to the Valley of the Temples. The temples and the archaeological museum are within walking distance and there is a bus nearby to the beach at San Leone.  There is not much nearby in the way of restaurants but the hotel food is good. Booking recommended. The waitresses were charming and cheerful but the waiters were brusque bordering on rude. Good breakfast.  The room was clean, comfortable and quiet.","9297":"Check out time at 10.30 and breakfast only until 9:30 is a little unusual for a high end season in europe. In addition to 40 eur fee in cash on the spot for late check-in because of a plane delay.  Large family room but wallpaper peeling off.  I don\u2019t think we are going back.","9298":"This is a perfect base to visit the temples from. The rooms are comfortable, the garden beautiful and the food good. The best thing though was the staff, every one of whom made interacting with them a pleasure. A special thank-you to first Daniel and then Gerlando on reception. I would have awarded 5 stars but the one disappointing aspect was the wifi which was sometimes too weak in the rooms to send an e-mail. If that is upgraded then they will deserve 5 stars.","9301":"Stayed here for the tour of the Valley of the Temples. Small Rooms, clean, small windows, elevators good for 4 person, garden unkept. Seem like everything going against this hotel but it really is good enough and it does serves it's purpose. For those staying a night to visit the Valley of the Temples. But come dinner, it is a different thing. It was one of the better meals I had in Sicily for my 12 days stay. Service is efficient. Food is amazing. Fresh Fish of the Day. Risotto with Red Shrimp and Orange Zest. The sauce of the Pork Steak was great. Pretty good dinner.","9302":"Maybe it\u2019s a good position and a large room but overall it\u2019s tired and the website presents a far better picture than the reality. Sadly lacking in Italian charm or style this small hotel could do with a makeover.","9303":"We stayed for a couple of nights at this lovely hotel. The staff were friendly and welcoming from the minute we arrived at reception. If it wasn't for the advice of the man on booking in, we wouldn't have gone to see the temples at sunset and that was something not to be missed. Our room on the top floor was large with a large window that looked over the garden, the Valley of the Temples and coast beyond - they are quite a distance away but it's a nice outlook. The bathroom was large and had nice toiletries. We had booked a meal for our first evening and, as the weather was good, we were able to sit in the covered outdoor restaurant which was lovely. We had a drink at the garden bar beforehand which is where we first encountered the fabulous Marialina - she was so friendly and fun throughout our stay. The garden is an oasis of prickly pears, citrus trees and cacti. Our dinner was so good that we made a reservation straight afterwards for dinner the following evening rather than finding a restaurant in the town which had been our plan. There was a choice of about 6 items per course and everything that we ate was obviously seasonal and portions are generous. The choice of food at breakfast is massive from fruit, yoghurt, pastries, home-made cakes and tarts, bread, cereal as well as cold meats and cheeses and a hot selection. It was hard to know where to start! This is served in the indoor restaurant which is light and airy with plenty of spacing between the tables. The lounge area has plenty of large, comfy sofas so it was a pleasant place to relax after dinner. They do also serve a small menu at lunchtime - we had a nice toasted sandwich on our second day. You could walk to the temples from here if you wanted - downhill there but a climb back. We did consider walking into the town but were glad that we had taken the car as it's quite a long uphill climb. There is a car park for the hotel which is the first you reach when driving up into the town so no problems with where to leave your car if you have one. If arriving by train, it's a short taxi ride from the station. A really friendly and relaxing place to stay. If we return to Agrigento, we will definitely stay here again.","9306":"Clean comfortable well located hotel,we had a suite with an extra room with a sofa,dining area and lots of wardrobe space only downside bathroom a bit small but had a good shower. Good breakfast with a very nice smiley lady serving. Excellent reception staff who showed us places of interest on the city map and recommended an excellent fish restaurant and were very helpful when I was knocked down by a car on our departure day and arranged for a taxi to collect our luggage from the hotel to the hospital and then to the airport","9307":"The hotel is nice and location is great, however staff was not at all courteous. On our arrival the receptionist, by the name of David, forced us to take another room because we have a 9 years old kid, my nephew. Although, the hotel website clearly states that children up to 12 years can accompany adults. We paid for an extra room. An experience we never had before.","9308":"With a view from its garden of the Valley of the Temples, the hotel is a splendid place to stay when visiting that site. Not only is the hotel garden very special, the breakfast room and lobby are also gracious areas. The only negative was that the AC was not yet working in our room but fortunately the windows opened and the evening turned cool. Our stay at the hotel was the perfect complement to our visit to the Valley of the Temples.","9310":"Had a perfect stay here. Can walk to the Temples. But we took a taxi because of our older family members. Hotel arranged taxis. Outside patio area was nice. Amazing view of the temples from there too. Can walk easily to restaurants. Or can eat in hotel. We did both. Very nice breakfast. Only complaint was that the beds were hard. Would stay again.","9312":"This is a fantastic hotel to visit the Valley of the temples, we had pre arranged to drop off our luggage, which we did before we visited the temples and also parked the car as we were able to easily walk down to the site. This was one of the most amazing sites we have ever seen. We ate dinner at the hotel and there was a mix up with our courses although the food was pretty good, breakfast was also very nice, I wish the weather had been better so we cold have enjoyed he wonderful gardens and amazing views, Our room had everything we needd although it was a little worn around the edges, We left the car and walked up into the town the next day it was a Saturday morning and there was a little market in the square. The hotel was perfect for what we needed.","9315":"Good evening,  we spent a few days in this hotel and it was good. only the alitalia lost our suitcases service was pleasant but their help with our lost baggage not was good.  The location is perfect  Salutimo  Buono albergo","9317":"The hotel is Airport style rooms and service (minimal) and completely out of character for Sicily and especially The Valley of the Temples for whose visitors it is located. The rooms are small and amenities less than the minimum. However, the breakfast was a very nice surprise, rich tasty and with excellent service in a nice airy space.","9320":"We recently stayed 5 nights and had suite with dining area and sofa. Very spacious & clean and air conditioning was spot-on. Staff were very courteous and the lady who looked after breakfast was really friendly and cheerful. Breakfast itself was the usual of yoghurt, fruit, cheeses, meats, pastries etc. I would rate it as satisfactory.  The location is great. Only about 10 15 minutes from the drop off and pick up for the airport shuttle. The hotel is just off Va Roma which is one of the main streets in the city. Picking up that street you were within walking distance of all of the major sites and the railway station & bus station.  Would return & would recommend.","9325":"For anyone visiting Agrigento and the Valley of the Temples and able to combine this amazing World Heritage Site with a glimpse of the reality of modern life in the wonderfully preserved mediaeval and Baroque old town centre, Kerkent is ideal. The house is in a small and quiet square high up in the old quarter, the rooms are simple and well-equipped, as are the bathrooms and the breakfast room and terrace and the house itself is an old family house, still cared for by members of the family. Gisela and her brother take the greatest care of their guests and my husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our too-short stay with them. We would definitely plan to stay there again.","9332":"Sono stato a Febbraio in questo residence collocato in un palazzo storico nel centro di Palermo e posso solo raccomandarlo caldamente.  L'edificio \u00e8 molto ben ristrutturato e gli ambienti sono pulitissimi ed arredati in modo sobrio ma con gusto. Avendo prenotato una stanza singola ero preparato come a volte accade di avere qualcosa tra il ripostiglio la cabina della nave, invece la stanza era molto grande (credo fosse 25-30 m2), in effetti un vero miniappartamento, bene arredata e dotata di ogni comfort. Non capita spesso con gli hotel, ma devo dire pi\u00f9 bella che in fotografia.  La colazione a buffet \u00e8 varia e di ottima qualit\u00e0, con pasticceria artigianale e una buona scelta di dolce e salato.  Il personale \u00e8 gentilissimo, preparato e pronto ad aiutarvi per ogni esigenza.  Tutto perfetto, assolutamente consigliato,un rapporto qualit\u00e0 prezzo mai visto pur tenendo conto che era bassa stagione. Spero di tornarci.  I was on vacation in this residence located in a historic building in Palermo center and I can highly recommend it.  The building is very well renovated and the rooms are very clean and furnished in a sober but tasteful way. Having booked a single room I was prepared (as sometimes happens) to have something between a closet and a ship cabin , but actually the room was very large (I think it was 25-30 m2), in fact a real mini-apartment, well furnished and equipped of every comfort.  It does not happen often with hotels, but I must say better than in pictures.  The breakfast buffet is varied and of excellent quality, with artisanal pastry and a good choice of sweet and savory, though as it is often the case in Italy sweet is predominant.  The staff is very kind, prepared and ready to help you for every need.  Everything perfect, absolutely recommended, a value for money rarely seen while taking into account that it was low season. I hope to visit it again.","9333":"Very good hotel with following plus : - perfect location, quiet place but so close to center and to start of hop-on hop-off city bus; also a couple of very good restaurants around (not the the one just in front of hotel though) - very large room actually composed of two rooms (one very large bed room with a desk and TV and lots of space to move around + one entrance with a sofa and a desk and all wardrobes), old-fashioned lovely decoration, very clean and cosy, perfect bed - functional bathroom with all equipment - lots of towels, and changed daily - lovely lights in room, you can create your own atmosphere easily - we were in wintertime : heating works well - tasty, quality and large-choice buffet breakfast in a small but cosy restaurant room - very good WI-FI + a laptop accessible in lobby (we had taken our own laptop but forgotten the charger :-) - extremely nice, smiling, helpful personnel at reception, you feel like a real guest they really make you feel good, and comfortable, which we so much appreciated - last but not least, a very good price if you take the early-bed web non refundable rate  The very small minus, which cause us to put 4 stars and not 5 (really, it is extremely minor) - no view from room as they are on a smallish street - no 'do not disturb sign' in room, or so well hidden that we did not find it - safe too small for laptop - no shower head and hose in bathroom only a raining shower (we used shower cap all the time when we did not want to wash our hair) - bathroom is a bit tiny - not carpet at bedside  Basically, we really loved this hotel and it is obvious that we will get there when we go back to Palerme and we disseminated the address to already half a dozen friends.","9345":"We appreciated having a suite. It was very spacious with a sofa and a dining table. The bathroom was immaculately clean. The buffet breakfast was very good; the croissants especially were delicious and the lady who served us each morning was always very welcoming and eager to make us cappuccino or espresso. All of the staff were extremely helpful to us and went to a lot of trouble in helping us plan our itinerary each day including printing out bus and train timetables. The hotel is in a good central location for exploring Palermo and there are several good restaurants in walking distance of the hotel.","9347":"As a frequent traveller I've stayed at numerous properties, including 4 and 5-star ones. What I would like to say is that Residenza d'Aragona, in my point of view, is rather not a 4-star accommodation to start with. But let's start anyway: check-in was very fast as I didn't even need to fill any forms. During my stay there were two receptionists: a very helpful one and the one who has had a typical don't care that much attitude. I don't know their names but anyway... The receptionist who was checking me in looked like as if he wasn't bothered with the job at all. He only gave me the key, didn't provide with any wi-fi password. When I've asked him to highlight some places of interest on the map, his attitude was like as he was doing me a huge favour. The room door from inside looked like as someone started fixing it but didn't manage to finish his work: there were screw holes on the door edges but no screws. One of the top locks was damaged and was almost falling out from the door. I've informed the reception but was told that due to the local law locking doors at hotels from inside is not allowed in case there is a fire. The room was clean but very dark as window was overlooking the wall. There was almost no light. Bathroom was small but also clean and well-maintained. Sleeping quality was very average as there was a noise coming from an engine or whatever device it was in one of the rooms upstairs. Breakfast was pretty good but with a limited food selection. Kitchen staff was very pleasant and friendly. Some positive things about the property: the location is convenient as it is situated pretty close to many places of interest. Just to summarise the above: Residenza d'Aragona needs to train properly some of their staff members and invest more in the rooms.","9361":"A very comfortable and spacious apartment including kitchen, dining and lounge. A small lift to make for easy luggage handling. The most secure doors have ever seen in an accommodation venue anywhere in the world. Squeaky clean.","9374":"I stayed at the Casa Galati In may for 3 nights which was not planned And it turned out to be absolutely brilliant! The place , location, design, breakfast, and Mario the host were Fantastic and very helpful Will definitely return there !!!","9376":"Marco was there to welcome us on arrival. The room was spacious, with importantly for us, a means of making tea and coffee. The rooms are serviced regularly, clean towels every second day. Marco and his dad were a great hosts at breakfast, full of suggestions as to how we could spend our day. Good to have the local knowledge and the history of the building itself.  Two minute walk from the Teatro Massimo.","9384":"We took the bus, which is out the doors of the airport (only doors) turn right, about 70m, its slighty around the corner, not the 1st bus sign.. its where the bench seats are, u can buy tickets at the airport, this is not a large airport. The bus will drop u oppersite Treatro Politeama, the drivers know it... its a well known place, theres a bus stop.. and you carry on down that street till u find a narrow street on your left called Cozzo. Small lift up.. this a great B & B, neat, very clean, well presented. Location No 1... we did the red line hop on hop off bus, tickets and stop are on the B & B side of the Treatro Politeama, turn right, about 60m. Did it in the morning before the traffic makes it to slow, did the whole round, got our bearings and went again half way, got off at the train station and did the sights by foot from there walking back to the B&B via the walking only street.. the best thing is the bus map, gives a better picture of Palermo. Enjoyed Palermo so much more as we got our bearings early... heaps of eats near the B&B. To finish our host Marco was great, we should of made more use of his knowledge.","9397":"Mario and Marco are very welcoming hosts, and were kind enough to spend time chatting to a sole traveller over breakfast. The decor is nice and bright, and everywhere is beautifully clean. The location is great, being just around the corner from Teatro Massimo with bus stops nearby. Would love to stay there again.","9412":"The B&B is as charming and adorable as it's name. It has curved walls and ceiling and is clean and bright. Location also quite unbeatable as it is safe and walking distance to everywhere. Marco and Mario are attentive and generous hosts and gave us fantastic recommendations of local food places. Definitely one of our all time favorite B&Bs.","9414":"This B& B is run by a father and son. I had the great pleasure of meeting Marcos, the father who waited for my late flight and came to meet in the street as I missed the sign with the street name, my fault. He was waiting with a big smile despite my late arrival. I couldn't recommend enough this B& B. I felt like at home. The breakfast was made of a fabolous coffee, fresh homemade cakes, orange juice, yogurt, ham, cheese, bread etc. Marcos recommended me local places to go for a meal which I really loved and enjoyed it. The B& B is really well located. I am a female solo traveller and I felt safe to come back late as it was central. The place was immaculate, really really spotless. A big thank you for everything. I will come back with family or friends next time.","9422":"The B&B is located right at the shopping street, you are in for a party during the weekends if you stay here.  The owners of the B&B are all so helpful and friendly too.  It is located within walking distance to most attractions and many eateries, pubs, gelateria around the corner too.","9491":"the hotel is very well run with modern, clean, though not so big rooms (but then value is excellent for Palermo)! What was extraordinary though was how helpful the owner was in helping us find a parking! literally spent 45' with me helping me out...! thanks again","9499":"Simply the best B&B in Agrigento: Owners Giusi Gaetano were extremely kind and made us to feel confortably at home. The house is extremely well located, close to the sea and to the bars and restaurants area The rooms are very clean and comfortable, with a spacious badroom. Wifi in the room is sometimes slow Our hosts prepared the best breakfast we ever had, homemade jams, biscuits and cake served with a good cappuccino and even a handmade lemon granita The worthfull tips of Giusi and Gaetano were a visit worth: for example Caico restaurant just closeby to taste local fish and sicilian food ...excellent! We will visit them again!","9501":"Pietro has set up an excellent B&B with clean and spacious rooms, beautiful in-room bathroom, modern furniture and accessories, a performing wifi, very good breakfast with fresh local specialties.\r \r You are perfectly located between Teatro Massimo e Teatro Politeama, you can walk all the way through your visit.\r \r Finally, Pietro can help you out in organizing your visit and offer a pick up service from to airport.\r \r Bravo!","9526":"We ended up staying at B&B Cannoli by a happy accident, as our other B&B ended up closing unexpectedly. This place was amazing! In addition to being perfectly renovated and modern down to the last detail, Pietro was so helpful and accommodating. We were able to park our car in the courtyard for 15 euro per day with advanced notice, which helped so much! He welcomed us with beer and wine and was there for everything we needed the whole time. I can't say enough good things about this place! Next time we're in Palermo, we'll be back.","9528":"Staff were wonderful, helpful, pleasant. The room and bath were modern and the bed was so comfortable! The location is the prize. Open the door and you are on the main street of Palermo. Wine bar Enoteca next door and Mixology across the street.","9541":"The soundproofing was so good we were not disturbed by any noise from Via Maqueda, a popular pedestrian street adjacent to the hotel. We stayed in Norma, which was roomy enough for our family of three adults. It has excellent AC, chic d\u00e9cor, and a modern bathroom with good water pressure. We found the staff helpful and accommodating, especially Flaviana who gave us good advice recommendations for dining and sightseeing. The breakfasts here were the best we had during our two week Sicily holiday.","9549":"The title tells about everything you need To know. I stayed here totally 9 days and this morning when I'm packing My stuff, I already miss this place and this crew, who really are Heart of Dimora Bellini :heart:. At first, Super big thank you for changing My room, to better one for free :smiling_face_with_three_hearts: Grazie Mille Kiitos paljon for always so helpful, and sunny receptionworker Flaviana. At the first moment we met, I felt myself very welcome here. I always got help, no matter what was the question about. Great tips, recommentations where To go, what To eat, or translating Italian description. Big thank also belongs to Marqeta, lady behind housekeeping and breakfast serving (Sorry I'm very bad at names, but you Will recognize her warm smile from a miles away :) Breakfast is the most important meal at the Day, and it was a pleasure started with here. Breakfast was good and tasty: Different kind of meats, cheeses, fress fruits, also slided ones, boiled eggs, 3 type cerials, cheese&ham pie, bread, yogurt etc... And also some sweet To eat with special expresso, latte or caffe americano maded fress for u.  Pictures doesn't lie at all, this place is as good as it looks like on the Page. My Rooms was beautifully decorated. BED was BIG and Sooo Good To sleep, big pillows was also super nice . Bathroom was like a another room, it also look stunning. For me Dimora Bellini was a perfect touch To get known and explore Palermo city easily, and the Best start for My Sicily trip. I`m gonna give you 6 5  Aki from Finland","9551":"This was my second time at Dimora Bellini and of course I deeply recommend it. The rooms are very comfortable and with a nice vintage taste on Italian porcelains and furniture. Breakfast is fresh and well-served, with expressos and cappuccinos made by the attendants. Besides all good service, the building also was house of Vicenzo Bellini in Palermo and the decorations are worth checking, what make this B&B a \u201cmust-stay\u201d in Palermo. Finally the location is perfect and you can easily sightseeing Palermo from Dimora Bellini.","9554":"This is a lovely little hotel in a fab location in the centre of Palmero. Even though it's on a busy street the street noise did not reach our room at the top the hotel at all. The bed was large and very comfortable and the bathroom was clean and of good size.  The only downside to having the room at the top of the hotel was that the wooden roof 'clicked' all night, which I think was as it contracting and detracting in the heat sun. it can\u2019t really be helped but was quite distracting when you're trying to sleep!  Overall highly recommended :)","9586":"Location: This hotel is located near the four corners area, and within walking distance to most major attractions in Palermo. We arrived via taxi arranged by the hotel, late at night, and the driver was particularly helpful in making sure we got into our room (given there is no night reception here), and left us instructions for the next morning. If you're arriving at night on your own, make sure to make arrangements. There is a parking lot nearby.  Suite: Our suite was attractive, well laid out, well-furnished and had character features. Ours was a bit small, which is typical of a period property. The air con worked well, and there was a kettle and small fridge. It was also quiet and comfortable. There is a common area which nice furnishings, and a loft breakfast space.  Breakfast: Was quite good. There was a variety of savories and pastries. The host also provided hot items like eggs. We found the service to be very attentive and they were very helpful in directing us to good places to eat, etc.  If we return to Palermo, we would certainly stay here again!!","9595":"Dimora Bellini is on the first floor of an old building, behind a big door and up marble steps, really quirky. Inside is quite amazing and unique. We loved staying here, right on the main street just up the road from Teatro Massimo and walking distance to pretty much everything. It was great being able to nip out, shop, tour, eat, drink, nip back for a quick shower and back out again. Katia was great, really helpful and gave us lots of information.","9600":"The management must have responded swiftly to the criticisms in the 'Bait & Switch' review below as we found the breakfast offerings absolutely delightful. No Kraft cheeses or supermarket jellies. There was a tasty selection of cold meats, cheeses, fresh tomatoes and boiled eggs with lovely fresh bread. Fresh fruit, marmalades & jams plus a great choice of fresh pastries. I actually wondered if the reviewer had got the correct place as we saw no evidence of an unused oven nor lonesome fried egg! For 3 Euro pp we breakfasted here each day before heading out to explore Palermo. The location is terrific. So central to everything. When you arrive home hot and sticky after tramping around Palermo's sights the Dimora Bellini is an oasis of cool stylishly decorated charm. Marco the manager speaks excellent English and was available to provide answers to any questions and give good advice on what to see and where to go. Without question I would stay there again if I were to return to Palermo.","9602":"Once upon a time the Luxury Dimora Bellini had a great mouth watering breakfast advertised and displayed on various web sites such as this one with fresh fruit artfully arranged and home made pastries as was mentioned in previous reviews, we cancelled another reservation to be able to enjoy it at the end of our Sicilian odyssey.  Unfortunately this is no longer the case as the attached photos attest, the cheese brochettes have been replaced by plastic Kraft singles which is something I have not witnessed in any Hotel breakfast from living memory. One morning a lonesome fried egg was sitting on the counter since God knows how long. A large oven stands like a Maytag repairman in the kitchen with little to do since absolutely nothing whatsoever in the breakfast served seemed to have been baked in it.  From what we gathered the B&B either was bought or is otherwise under new management and they seem to be in cost-cutting mode, the manager was unaware at check-in that we had requested a second bed and, although it was agreed 5 months ago to be added at no cost, he seemed to imply that he was doing us a favor by not charging us for it. The location is still great and the rooms were as advertised but unfortunately it now seems a forelorn shell without a soul that will wither in time.","9681":"From the via Maqueda you go through an old door and it seems another world! A nicely designed room, complete, clean and very pleasant people! We did not get the breakfast because we had to leave early but that was a shame because it seemed excellent! Located in the center of Palermo. Highly recommended!!","9683":"I\u2018ve been there for a couple of days with my girlfriend and my parents as well, Agrigento is very nice place which have nice monument and beach, the B&B is located in the center between two important place. Francesco and his wife are very lovely and friendly people which helped us by phone once arrived there; the location is so nice,clean and quite. They suggest a lot of beautiful place to visit and even eat in. I really recommend them. Enjoy your holidays","9713":"The hotel is located in a Traffic Limited Area (TLA) and actually before we booked the hotel, the hotel confirmed to us that we can safely pass the TLA, as they have the permission for the passengers. But in half a year, we got the fine from local police department saying that my car passed the TLA without permission. We are surprised about this and so we communicated with the hotel, but the hotel refused to admit their mistake. This hotel has no integrity!! We stayed 2 nights and power was off twice; Hot water is not enough during taking shower; The effect of heating system is not good; The parking slots around hotel are too limited; The owner of hotel speak English very poorly and need to communicate in written.","9721":"We really enjoyed our one night stay here in the centre of Agrigento. The house was quirky, plenty of steps, and spotlessly clean. The room was small and cosy, the shower a little too small (hence the 4 stars rather than 5).","9722":"This is a nice place to stay if you don't have a car. It is just in the center, it's forbidden to park here. You have to look outside and every single place you be occupied. The breakfast is good, place clean but the mattress is bad.","9731":"we, a group of 5 went for one day to Agrigento! Francesco and his wife were absolutly nice and very helpful! There was no problem with the car, if you have any question just contact Francesco, he will help you with anything! The recommendation for a restaurant was so good, just around the corner, no tourists and wonderful meals! We will surely come back! Tanti saluti da Germania Evelyn, Matteo, Francesco, Stefano e Christine","9750":"I stayed here for three nights in February and I slept in Room No. 1 - a quiet and spacious room with a comfortable bed, lovely flooring and a large bathrom. Although this room has a French window which looks out on a very enclosed space and gives little light to the room, I believe that, all things considered - for example the excellent breakfast, the charming and helpful hosts, plus the reasonable price - this is a very nice place to stay and I have no hesitation in recommending it.","9775":"I ended up staying 3 nights at this place. It is very centrally located. It is in an old building. I have stayed in b&bs like this in Europe in many places and i found this to be drab. The room was large but he bed barely functional. Who has breakfast at 8.30? I am normally at work at 8 so i had breakfast elsewhere so as not to feel hungry. And when I did eat there all you get is little bits of bread and ham and cake. Now i know this is what Italians clearly eat for breakfast but why serve it in such small portions. In the end the whole vibe of the place annoyed me.","9779":"Ai Vicere is in a wonderful location, 100 metres from Teatro Massimo and the lively scene in Piazza Verdi, but very accessible on foot from all Palermo's top attractions. On the night we arrived, far from having the balcony advertised, we were given a dark room virtually without a window, whose washbasin did not empty, whose toilet did not flush, and whose bathroom door squeaked so loudly that it woke up any sleeper at night. I had no intention of staying, so we did not unpack, an easy decision as there was literally not a cupboard or a chest of drawers or even a recess to unpack anything into. The next morning I said we would either change rooms or change hotels and were given a beautiful second floor room with a painted ceiling, huge French doors overlooking a landscape of gardens and mountains, and ample cupboard space. The reason I have put this down in detail is because I am still indignant, having made my booking six months ago, that we were ever given the initial room in the first place. I have low expectations of Italian breakfasts, and was not taken by surprise at Ai Vicere. My main reservation about the B & B was that there was no public space in which to spend time if one wanted to be out of the bedroom. We liked the management and thought it significant that during our stay the majority of our fellow guests were Italian.","9781":"We only stayed for one night (unfortunately!) but we found Ai Vicere perfect for our needs. We had a groundfloor room with our own bathroom. Even though it was right next to the breakfast room, I didn't think it was noisy or anything. We shared the outdoor terrace with the common area but it was nice to be able to sit outside right in front of the room (beware of the mosquitoes though!). The room was simple but very inviting and comfortable. The bathroom small but functional (the water pressure isn't great - that would be my only complaint but it is an older building so probably not much you can do there). We were given the parking information when we arrived and it's in very close walking distance and a cheap option. On the day of departure we were able to leave our luggage for later which was perfect. Eleonora was a superb hostess and gave us a general overview of Palermo and it's main sights. She offered us a refreshment right when we got there which was so thoughtful as it was a hot day. Breakfast had a good variety of savoury and sweet options plus a coffee machine. there was plenty of food and all freshly prepared. Overall our stay was great, communication prior to arrival was helpful and the mini bar items were a nice touch and very well priced. The room was really quiet despite being on the groundfloor. There are a few steps to get to the front door but all manageable even for people who can walk well (like my mum!). I'd definitely come back and recommend this place to anyone looking for a convenient place to stay. It was so central and we were at the Teatro Massimo in less than five minutes. There are some shops around for groceries as well and we walked to a restaurant nearby - couldn't have asked for a better location.","9794":"I stay in a lot of hotels and love 4 5 star when I can afford it, however this B&B gives you a lot of 4 star comforts for a fraction of the price,while providing friendlier and more atmospheric accommodation than in large chain hotels. The rooms are on a separate floor from the reception and breakfast room giving the feel of an appartment and indeed my very spacious bedroom and bathroom felt like an appartment. A big comfy bed,couch air con, TV, big well equipped bathroom plus my own little hallway. I didn't have a balcony but large windows provided a view of gorgeous vegetation though you are overlooking other appartments. However it was very quiet and I was charmed to be able to look out at Italian life. Lots of little nooks and crannies in communal areas with bookshelves containing reading material for guests as well as a comfortable lounge, all very homely. Breakfast was plentiful and though the breakfast space is a little cramped there was more space out in the patio surrounded by lush vegetation. The staff  owners were really lovely and very helpful. A real gem of a little place and an authentic taste of Palermo. Loved my two nights there!","9816":"Beautiful restored building, with very spacious rooms fully equipped with nice decorative touches. The room and hotel areas were very clean, and the view from my balcony to the enclosed gardens and Palermitan landscape was beautiful. The location and neighborhood are excellent, just 3 minutes from Politeama, major stores and outlets and Teatro Massimo. Convenient transportation options from to the airport. The breakfast is served on the main reception area and the buffet offers many selections and a great variety of salty and sweet delicacies, with authentic \u201cPalermitano\u201d flavor! And of course full coffee and tea selection, freshly squeezed juices, cereal, fruits and more. But the best asset of the hotel is the friendly and warm atmosphere created from the staff , that make you feel most welcomed and cared for. A defined suggestion and a great value for money option!","9841":"I booked a room 6 weeks in advance for our family of 4. When we arrived, at 2:30 am (delayed, late night flight from Santorini) we found only 1 single bed and 1 double bed in our room. Okay, not the worst thing in the world as our 13 year old was able to sleep in the double bed with my husband and me. We then attempted to turn on the air conditioning as the room was hot and muggy (July in Sicily). Nope, the air conditioning was BROKEN. Okay, things are definitely getting worse but we will just do our best and use the fan WITH A LIGHT THAT BLINKED ON AND OFF THE ENTIRE NIGHT. Okay, fine, we will deal with that as well. It's late and we're tired (it's 3:00 am by this point and there's no one to complain to as they don't have an overnight desk person. We were given a code to get in to the hotel and then found the room by trial and error). We sleep fitfully but hope we can sleep in...NOPE. AT SIX FREAKING THIRTY IN THE MORNING, CONSTRUCTION WORKERS START BANGING AROUND OUTSIDE OUR WINDOW. Folks, I am not making this up. We try to sleep through it but by 8 am give up and stumble down to breakfast. That was the only decent thing about the hotel. So, we're thinking, let's just enjoy our breakfast and get our rental car and get on the road to Agrigento per our travel planned itinerary. NOPE. The rental car, that Luca had told me he would arrange to have at the hotel at 10 am (which I confirmed 3 times in various emails 4-6 weeks prior to our arrival) doesn't arrive. The reason? LUCA FORGOT TO BOOK OUR CAR RENTAL. The car rental company is completely out of cars to rent. They gave us a 10 year old car to rent that was barely larger than a SmartCar. So, to sum up, Luca didn't have enough beds in our room, had a construction crew working outside of our bedroom window at 6:30 in the morning (which he clearly knew about as he was helping out with the construction), and did not have a rental car for us as promised. AND HE STILL MADE US PAY FOR THE ROOM. He gave us a good discount (his words, not mine) and charged us 90 euros. Worst, Experience. Ever.","9843":"I booked the guesthouse Ai Vicere via Booking.com => Advanced payment, no possibility to cancellation  storno. A doubleroom for 3 nights a little more than 600 Euro. This hotel is marked as disabled-friendly - which is in reality not the case. My old travel partner is way in his 80th and cannot climb stairs very well. So there were about 15 steep stairs to the elevator, and as the room was in the 5th floor another steep 25 stairs to the upper level because the lift works only up to the 4th floor. So we just could not take this room.  Ai Vicere offered us another room in the 2nd floor, but it was dark, run down in general like the whole old house, the cupboard was too high for my co-travellar, and there was a scaffolding in front of the window where workers were going along painting the facade. So we didn't want to take that room for 200 Euro a night. In addition, on the level for breakfast there was no washing room, so one has to go to his room for toilet. The breakfast room has no window and the quality of the furniture is normally used for camping or a small street caf\u00e9. No joke.  The guest house Ai Vicere has some rooms scattered on several floors of an old house, it's not a true hotel. The fotos of the Ai Vicere rooms in Booking.com and other hotel platforms do not show the reality at all, they are trickily done with a lot of extra artificial headlights.  So we left Ai Vicere after 20 Minutes and went to Hotel Mercure, which is very modern and luxury in comparison to this guesthouse Ai Vicere, and it was about the same price: 200 Euro a per night. Good choice.  Ai Vicere is a guesthouse for backpackers, worth between 60 to 90 Euro a night due to the location downtown, not because of the comfort. The manager seems friendly, but later on I experienced his inner face.  Two weeks later I wanted the 600 Euro back, and he told me No, it was booked without possibility for camcellation. I could have taken his other (dark) room with the scaffolding in front of the window.  In this matter Booking.com was very helpful!! They phoned with Ai Vicere and came to the agreement, 300 Euro to pay by Ai Vicere and the other 300 Euro payed by Booking.com. The money by Booking.com arrived a few days later, but Ai Vicere didn't repay. I had to write about 25 Mails in this matter to the Service line of Booking.com, and did about 8 phone calls to Booking. Ai Vicere claimed several times, they do not have my bank account data, but I've sent them immediately to Palermo, and they ignored the mails.  Finally Booking.com decided to pay the amount of Ai Vicere to me in advance and reclaim it from Ai Vicere themselves. Three days after that, Ai Vicere paid me the 300 Euro. Ufff. It took me more than 2 month to get the money back from Ai Vicere. The manager is not ok. Without the support of Booking.com I never would have gotten back any money.  My tip: Don't pay a lot to Ai Vicere, for the same money you can get a professional hotel with a very good comfort and a broad variety of breakfast, like in Mercure Hotel eg. And don't pay in advance without the possibility to cancel ...","9846":"On a very strategic location for shopping and only 2 steps away from one of the most beautiful theater in Europe (Teatro Massimo on Piazza Verdi). A real dip in the antique town of Palermo with its amazing atmosphere...","9848":"Excellent location near the theatre Massimo and within walking distance to train and buses. Breakfast was decent with a variety of savoury as well as sweet options. Don't arrive on a Sunday as no one is around and we were given incorrect information and my friend and I spent hours waiting for each other in different rooms! The cleaning staff are lovely and although we left early in the morning, we were left some food in the dining room for breakfast. We would definitely stay again","9849":"We only stayed one night, but our family of six was comfortable and enjoyed our stay very much. The only problem we had was that one of our beds was missing sheets, but we just used the top sheet from the other bed.","9855":"We would love to return to Palermo and we would stay again at Ai Vicere. It's the perfect location. The rooms are large and accommodating and the breakfasts are amazing! Luca manages the B&B with a friendly professionalism. He was so helpful in giving us an orientation to the city an tips about restaurants and places to visit.","9859":"We had a great stay at Ai Vicer\u00e8. The room was spatious, nicely decorated and quiet. The private bathroom wasn't attached to the room, but that was no problem. Breakfast was very good! Especially the surprise birthday cake for our son was unforgettably sweet (in every sense). The owner (Luca) gave us useful tips for places to eat and visit! For people traveling by car: there is a car park nearby (you can get a map from the staff), so don't worry. If we will stay in Palermo again (which we hope for) we wouldn't hesitate to book this great B&B again!","9864":"Our first night of two staying here. What a fabulous place. An olive farm with beautiful scenery. The family are so friendly and have made us feel very welcome. There were about 14 of us at dinner this evening. All on one table. There was a large party who just interacted between themselves then us two and a young couple beside us. What an amazing night we had chatting to them. Very interesting people. All the others left long before the four of us. The food, mainly fish, was amazing and the company exceptional. Thank you to Salvatore and his family for a wonderful time.","9875":"This is a terrific B&B in the middle of a residential street. The area is lively, varied and colourful, with a real sense of energy. You live in the home of Manlio and Manuela and are treated as a guest. A very comfortable room with a birds eye view over this part of Palermo from the balcony. Breakfast gets you going. And Manlio and Manuela are full of information on places to visit in the city - especially restaurants. Do ask about the nearby piazza which has three different world heritage churches. Stunning.","9876":"This was our second stay at La Via Delle Biciclette and, if anything the standards of service have improved over the past two years. Both Manlio and Manuela are busy preparing for their second B&B, but they take the time to make their guests feel at home. We love the mix of languages and laughter around the breakfast table in this gem of a B&B.","9886":"The place was in a very historic place. Very close to important places to visit in Palermo. Manuela and Manlio were very hospitable hosts. Give advice on where to eat and where to go. Rooms were clean and breakfast was more than you could ask for.","9888":"We wanted to stay in the Old Town to experience the feel of the narrow streets, local markets, museums, palaces, churches, and old buildings. La via delle Biciclette filled the bill! It is a flat in a 16th century building that used to be a palatial residence. The host parked in what was a grand circular drive-through entrance with tall ceilings and granite staircases to the upper floors. The B&B was very comfortable and the hosts made it like home. We hired the host to pick us up at the airport and he even took us to the car rental agency upon the completion of our visit. He and his wife were most helpful in guiding us to the sites we were interested in seeing and making excellent dinner recommendations. We were very happy with this most convenient B&B and the hosts.","9897":"manilo & manuela are the best hosts with the best appartement. superfriendly, fast communication, great recommendations & a beautiful and well located flat. thank you for everything - also for the pick up service from the airport!","9899":"Room was good - big, no windows only door, looks out into the balcony and there are 2 terraces Located in an predominantly olive farm. There is not much to do in the area, you can walk around, there are farms all around Food was ok, home cooked, tasted so, prepared from local produce Need GPS to find (there is a marker at a roundabout), Not too far from Valle dei Tempei","9907":"I stayed for 2 nights and the space was lovely. The room and bathroom were immaculate and very comfortable and the fresh fruit and coffee for breakfast was delicious. I can't eat gluten and they went out of their way to ensure there were gluten free biscuits and muffins for me to eat. I got it late after a delayed flight and then slept in through my check out time on my last day, and they couldn't have been nicer or more accommodating about it. Sicilian hospitality at its finest! Grazie to Luca, Manuela and Manlio for making my first trip to Italy Perfetto! I will definitely be back!","9910":"We only booked for one night, but wish we'd booked longer. This B&B has lots of character and charm, it's very clean and spacious and Manlio and Manuela couldn't have been more welcoming or helpful. It's in an old palazzo which is currently undergoing refurbishment and should be spectacular when finished. Manlio helped us carry our bags up, he came up with lots of great suggestions for sightseeing and he even drove us to the airport the next morning for a lot less than we would have paid for a taxi. This place is amazing value and you get a great breakfast included in the price. It was also really nice chatting to Manlio, who explained that this had been his mother's place, hence the authentic period decor. A really delightful place - and very warm welcoming hosts.","9913":"This is an excellent B&B. Very clean and comfortable and lovely breakfast. It is very welcoming and friendly. It is in a wonderful old building on the street with lots of bicycles in he old town part of Palermo, very near to all the attractions and a five minute walk from the station. My room was lovely and very quiet.","9916":"Stayed with Manlio & Maneula for 5 nights end of April and it was simply lovely. Very old town house they're renovating in the heart of the old city. Can't do enough for you, spotless, great breakfast and always a happy face","9925":"Good value for money. In the middle of the old town with all the sights. Close to the railway central station. Real Italian charm. Nice breakfast. The host family gives good advice on what to see. Just brilliant!","9940":"We only stayed one night but quickly wished we'd had time to stay longer. When we arrived we were sat down, given a local maps and detailed explanation of all the best places to go in Palermo and the best local eats! The room was large, bed comfortable and had our own private bathroom. Breakfast was fresh and delicious. The location is very handy for the train station and is only a short walk from centre of the old town. We really enjoyed our stay.","9942":"We had a lovely stay in the B&B. We have never visited Palermo before and it was great to stay in such a convenient location and authentic historical palazzo. The breakfasts were lovely and the hosts went out of their way to cater for my dietary requirements, even finding local restaurant recommendations for me which was incredibly helpful. The B&B is really interestingly decorated, and our room was large and comfortable. Getting advice and recommendations from locals is invaluable and this is one of the main selling points here - the hosts are very helpful about this.  Some things to note for expectations - there is some scaffolding in the building as it is very old and appears to be under renovation in parts, and the entrance way is a traditional courtyard style so a little dark, however neither of these things disturbed our visit in any way. Also, as Palermo is a city, it's always worth packing earplugs and an eye mask in case you are a light sleeper - as I do on all my trips.  Overall we found this B&B very good value and really got a lot out of the advice from the hosts, something you miss out on when staying in a hotel.","9973":"My wife and I just stayed one night here to see the ruins and it was adequate. It was very quiet being located in the countryside, however I agree with a previous reviewer, it was difficult to find (a amazingly nice person on a motorcycle actually led us to it). Once you find the right turn off, you're fine because it's well posted, however finding the correct turn off is difficult (a photo on their website might help.).  The daughter is, to my knowledge, the only one who speaks some broken English. The family seems very nice we just didn't have enough time to properly enjoy it.","10006":"The Al Vicoletto is a small hotel right in the center of Agrigento. The rooms are quite nice, clean and equipped with everything a traveler needs. The hotel does not offer breakfast, but there is a cafe just around the corner. The owners are very nice and helpful. It\u2019s great location and the very fair prices make it a good choice for an overnight in Agrigento. Why not 5 stars? Only small things, nothing important enough to call out.","10009":"Forget about this place if you want a relaxed holiday! After facing some issues along the road, we arrived with two kids at 20:22 and tried to call all the available phone numbers without success. Even with WhatsApp, the owner was online but refused to see and reply my messages. Some other guests and the nice guy from the restaurant downstairs tried to contact him as well but not even the emergency number worked. We gave up after two hours and found another hotel for the night. The following morning we finally went to Al Vicoletto, aiming to stay there at least for the second night. Surprisingly enough, the owner did not let us in, started screaming at us and even called the police! He said we should have been there no later than 19:30. He did not accepted to reimburse a cent and kept the whole payment for 2 rooms, 2 nights! I felt stolen 296 euros! Needless to say that someone who works with tourists should be more flexible than waiting for less than 1 hour for delayed guests. Last but not least, the bad mannered owner does not speak or understand a word in English. Forget about this place and try any of the other nice B&Bs around unless you accept to fully comply with the curfew and other absolute strict laws of this crazy owner!","10041":"Very Nice Clean Room place. I made the mistake of booking without breakfast so be careful when you book. I didn't know you could book a B&B without Breakfast. Receptionist is a Very Nice Gentleman. Fitness Center is very good. Mondello is a Great little Sea Side Resort, but Parking is a Premium!","10045":"I have returned today from a second stay in Al Baglio and you just cannot fault it for value for money, location, cleanliness and staff. In the centre of Mondelo, far enough away from the mathem of Palermo city centre, almost on the beach and the right side of the city for the airport. My room was clean, fully equiped with kitchenette, ensuit, and small terrace, a lovely place to stay.","10095":"I had stayed at this B&B for 4 nights in early April 2018. I had noticed that this location is somewhat a very recognised establishment as there are actually official road signs in Palermo & along the various inter sections on the major roundabouts from the airport bearing its name 'Al Baglio B&B'. No other B&Bs in Mondello were signaged as prominently as this. Upon arrival at this location by our rented car from the airport (about 30min easy drive), I was greeted my Stefania... Super friendly and efficient. She was my point of contact from the time I had booked this accommodation. Easy to communicate via WhatsApp number that is provided on their official website. Quick and fast response about room availability and price via WhatsApp. The B&B is charming, clean and well positioned in central Mondello. Our room was spacious and well equipped, just how the photos portrayed. Their service is great....Housekeeping was excellent, breakfast staff very accommodating and the boss is approachable with great tips on how to drive into Palermo safely with secured parking! It's the service at this B&B that will prompt me to return someday soon. It's close to various cafes and restaurants plus the beach! There is also a public bus service about 100m from this B&B. I'm told that in summer time, it's quite a challenge to get a room at this place. We were lucky to enjoy this B&B in early Spring! We did day trips to central Palermo, Cefalu and Trapani by driving our rented car. Not as scary and congested as we first thought. Will explore other parts of Sicily soon in the future. Won't hesitate to make Al Baglio B&B our base again!","10102":"Brilliant happy staff paid marvellous attention to my needs from allowing early occupancy to bringing breakfast to my room knowing I would be leaving early morning. The room was colourful, spacious, clean offering everything necessary. The central position a stones throw from the beach is perfect. Would highly recommend and wish I could stay. English language also helpful.","10105":"We had a lovely weeks stay here. A warm welcome, friendly and helpful staff and a great room. The room was very clean, large and had extras, like the mosquito repellent. The shower was great. Breakfast was lovely and we had a great expresso served with a huge smile every morning. The place was very central, minutes from great restaurants and the beach. The only thing lacking was a pool, but hey, you can't have everything!","10109":"We stayed 2 nights to decompress before joining a tour from Palermo. Family does a really good job. Warm and friendly. Arranged our airport pick-up and took us to Palermo after our stay. Room is spotless - fairly Spartan decor. The outdoor breakfast area is wonderful - A peaceful way to start your day. Capucino served as frequently as you like. We made a huge mistake our first night by leaving the window slightly ajar. Traffic was quite noisy. Only the next morning did we realize the windows - when cranked tightly shut - were very effective at nearly eliminating the noise. (I blame jet lag for this goof). Again, very conveniently located for lovely waterfront activities and restaurants. Excellent price value.","10111":"Good location for Mondello town   beaches. Bus service to Palermo close by and parking for own car about a 5 minute walk if none available in street. Rooms clean and bathrooms well appointed. Shared balcony - ours had view of sea. Staff helpful and breakfast OK.","10113":"Such a great place. The staff are very friendly. Before I even travelled they had emailed me to arrange a taxi from the airport to the hotel. When we arrived we were shown straight to our room. The room was a very good size and very clean. The young lady on the reception was very helpful and so was the boss. It's a very short walk to the beach. The hotel gave us towels and an umbrella to use which is very handy. The restaurant's are close by and there is a nice shop to get local meat cheese and wine. The gym room is also very clean and well maintained. I would definitely recommend this hotel to friends and family.","10119":"This was our 3rd time staying at B&B Al Baglio and it never disappoints. We enjoyed 4 wonderful nights. The B&B is very clean and comfortable. Breakfast is good and sufficient. The staff are very friendly and helpful, nothing was a problem. Information and transfers to Palermo Centrale and airport were taken care of by the lovely Stefana with a smile. Daniel the all rounder was always happy and cheerful which is a delight. The owner Joshua was also very nice and friendly. Nice to have English speaking staff. Highly recommend this B&B.","10168":"From the Booking.com pictures it looks nice inside but the entrance is off putting. Booking.com do not provide a picture of this - hardly surprising. I cancelled (at a cost) and stayed at a comfortable hotel - Gran Hotel Mose - in Villaggio Mose, with an ample car park, for the same price.  Parking on the street is a nightmare. Go to Villaggio Mose if you have a car","10169":"Well where do I start? This was a superb little find. First of all the hotel the owners Simon & Ricardo were very freindly hospitable & extremely helpful. The rooms were immaculate and the smell was the most beautiful thing ever it was like walking into a perfume shop of flowers everyday. We had our own private shower room with key, our rooms were beautiful and modern immaculate and cleaned daily and the breakfast was fabulous. Freshly made breads and pastries cold meats and cheese, yoghurt, fruits, fresh juicesjust help yourself. You can also have a coffee or a tea. The hotel is nestled in an array of cosmopolitan shops and bars you are surrounded by quaint and classy bistros and coffee bars and within walking distance of lots of local attractions museums cathedrals churches etc....If you have trouble walking then the bus service across the city is the easiest way to travel. We caught the airport bus whigh is a five minute walk around the corner and stops outside Prada it cost \u20ac6 for a ticket. Ricardo recommended a trip to Cefal\u00f9 which was \u20ac11 return on the train. This was my favourite place in Sicily a quaint little seaside town with such character and so picturesque it made my trip complete.... The restaurants are excellent typical Sicilian food and pizzareas are plentiful but also the odd Chinese or burger joint nearby. If like me you are a coffee snob I recommend you try Nandos American Coffee bar they do every coffee you can think of and you get a decent size too as coffee in Sicily comes in small cups and tends to be luke warm. All in all this vibrant City has lots to offer an amazing experience all round.","10340":"Our stay at Liberta was clean and functional but it started off rocky. Be aware that they only have check-in from 12:00-17:00. We rode the ferry from Napoli and we waited outside of the B and B for three hours. Furthermore, it was difficult to communicate with the host. After reading several reviews about the host we booked the location. Unfortunately they could not speak English or Spanish. I wish I knew more Italian but I don't! So we could not get any local advice for dinner or simply sights to see. I would recommend staying at another accommodation in Palermo where you can get some first hand knowledge from a 24 hour reception.","10341":"Lovely B&B hosted by Marco and Selene. On arrival we were greeted by Marco who was very helpful with local information and maps of the area. Our room was very clean and tastefully decorated. The location of the B&B is good for visiting the Valley of the Temples and the centre of Agrigento but a car is recommended as local restaurants are not within walking distance. Breakfast was prepared by Marco and Selene with a choice of Sicilian delicacies as well as cereal and fruit. Excellent supermarket across the road for local food. Parking on the premises. We stayed 3 days and thoroughly enjoyed our stay.","10345":"We had actually booked this place for two nights, but ended up staying only one. No problem with the accommodation itself, except for a missing elevator, but after touring Valle dei Templi already on the first night we had kind of done what we were in Agrigento for. Also, we like having a few restaurants in walking distance, and that was a bit difficult here. We found a pizza place which ended up having really good pizza, but we didn't want to do that two nights in a row. If you have a car and want a convenient location for Valle dei Templi, this is a good choice. But don't expect much from the area itself.","10357":"We could not fault the room and breakfast here. The bedroom and en suite shower room were a good size and very clean and modern. Marco, the owner was friendly and welcoming and provided a satisfying breakfast. Parking (free) immediately outside the building. The Valley of the temples is 10 minutes away, although the signage is confusing. Those booking here should be aware that dining options in the immediate area are very limited ( - we ended up having a Macdonalds!) and the b&b is sited in what is effectively an industrial estate where footpaths are at a premium, so a car is more or less essential.","10361":"It is a great location for seeing the Valley of Temples if you have car that needs parking overnight. There is a supermarket across the street for convenience, and the beach town of San Leone is just 10 minutes away. The hosts served excellent breakfast, and overall, it was an excellent stay.","10362":"Lovely B&B hosted by Marco and Selene. Very clean and comfortable B&B in a perfect location for visiting Valley of the Temples. Breakfast was prepared by Marco and Selene fresh and a choice of Sicilian delicacies as well as cereal and fruit. Excellent supermarket across the road with local food. Free parking on the premises also close to the beach. Will come back. Ciao Marco e Selene dall'Australia.","10367":"Very nice Bed and Breakfast, close to the beach and to temples of Agrigento.  Marco and her girlfriend are very nice and do everything to make your stay enjoyable.  Nice and clean rooms, good breakfast with a choice between sweet and saulty.  We recommend.","10415":"We were initially shocked at the location in Palermo (the back streets are filthy, there is graffiti everywhere and on beautiful heritage buildings) ... central Palermo is quite a shock ... but we settled in and had a fabulous time.  I think once we realized that it was safe to walk around, we got used to craziness of the place. We just didn't expect it to be so run down & delapidated.  The lift to the 5th floor where the guest house is located is antiquated but works! Everything was very clean inside the building (its just outside) and we were looked after by Guise (pronounced Juizzy) - she was absolutely wonderful and presented us with wonderful breakfasts and gratine everyday.  She also baked fresh cakes and went out of her way to make sure we were well taken care of & recommended brilliant places to visit and awesome restaurants.  The rooms looked tired and needed a bit of updating in terms of decor - but the linen was spotlessly clean ...  The aircons worked well, the lift was a thankful savior (we had in the previous accommodation had to carry bags to the 3rd floor)  Thank you for your hospitality!","10421":"I just stayed at Novecento for the second time and I spent a wonderful week there! The price is right, the breakfasts are delicious (including the best fresh-squeezed orange juice I've ever tasted!), I slept like a baby, the B&B is walking distance to nearly everything of interest in Palermo and Dario (your host) is a true gentleman: efficient, helpful and charming! Did I mention the fresh-squeezed orange juice? :)","10441":"We recently stayed here for 3 days while in Palermo. it is very centrally located, and very pleasant. the rooms are clean with modern bathrooms. Our host Dario was helpful (great restaurant suggestions) and even baked for breakfast. We would recommend it.","10530":"Novocento is a very comfortable B&B, with modern and thoughtful amenities and a classical  historical charm and feel. Dario, the owner, was the perfect host and guide to the city.  Breakfast was pleasant, with a few surprises thrown in (...homemade Strawberry Sorbet, for example!)  Highly recommended overall.","10581":"The B&B location is not the best one you can find. The street is really a big ramp, narrow and there is no place to park the car. You have to park down hill and carry on your luggage. Besides that you are in the middle of the old center which means that you can find everything like restaurants, stores, etc. The attractions are not very far. But, talking about the hotel facilities, it was a big surprise for me! The place is very nice,totally new And redecorated. The room is nice as well as the bathroom. The owners were very helpfull and friendly. They helped us with the luggage, the parking and other tips like restaurants. The breakfast was really good and I' m sure I will miss it!","10669":"a very nice place at the top of a little hill.very quiet and relaxing B&B at just 2 minutes from the temples valley and 10 min from AGRIGENTO center. the room and the kitchen have a nice view,the kitchen is full furnished,the owner is very kind and most important thing the price is a very convenient a real good value!","10698":"Great B&B, conveniently located, spacious and clean rooms, delicious breakfast with home-baked cakes and biscuits, outstandingly friendly host, really a nice place where to stay and spend a few days. A short drive away from the Valle dei tempi and from Agrigento town.","10728":"The location is in the heart of Agrigento! Newly recinstructed by the amazing architect with so many lovely details! Fabio is fabulous, very resposive, great instructions for parking, any kind of reccommendation! The best italien breakfast ever!","10730":"Perfect location, lovely room and rest area, very comfortable bed, great shower, very clean, very quiet for a good nights sleep. Breakfast was delicious and refined. We were warmly and perfectly greeted by the hosts. We highly recommend!","10750":"I stayed here for two nights in February 2019. The price was very economical at less than $40 per night (it was the low season). The room was comfortable with adequate heating. The breakfast was good. The staff was accommodating. The staff isn't regularly at the property, but they give you keys to come and go. It's a little out of the way from the center, but the 15-minute walk to the area where the train and bus station are aren't bad.","10758":"We stayed for a night mosty to visit the Valley of the Temples and the Scala dei Turchi both in the vicinity. Parking is not an issue as we did find parking spaces easily close to the place. The rooms are elegant and very clean. The owner was very friendly, welcoming and above all very helpful as she provided us with maps and other material and loads of info as to how to get to places and what best to visit. Above all breakfast was superb with many genuine local items for us to taste including some incredibly good mandarine marmalade amongst others. Perfect place.","10771":"Found through booking.com this b&b was very cheap and although the immediate area didn't look up to much the inside was lovely, the staff didn't speak a lot of English but with the help of google translate were very helpful and friendly. Gave us detailed advice on where to visit and stayed there two nights. After seeing the whole coastline of Sicily I would definitely recommend staying here and seeing the various surrounding beaches, the Turkish steps and most importantly the Valley of the Temples. Spotlessly clean and a very varied breakfast.","10807":"We had a booking near the Duomo that did not supply what it had promised so Expedia placed us here, in the lower part of town near the train station. But it was a blessing - we ended up with a friendly, helpful host, his mother's excellent cooking for breakfast, and a superb view. It was closer to the lovely Valley of the Temples, but unfortunately we saw little of the upper town.","10808":"A spacious immaculately clean unit with separate kitchen, including washer. Very comfortable bed and solid WiFi. Beautiful view from the balcony, and walking distance from train or bus. Everything here is well thought out. Breakfast was very good, with homemade cakes and jam. Claudio and Mauro are great hosts, very kind and responsive. We enjoyed our stay and would gladly return.","10811":"We arrived anbd found parking right across the street from thils delightful B&B. Marco welcomed us and showed us our room - actually more like a little suite with its own kitchen - breakfast was provided each morning which was brought in the night before - we always sat outside on the patio marvelling at the views across to the Greel ruins while we ate our breakfast - Thank you again, Maro","10814":"We weren\u2019t expecting to receive such hospitality from our hosts. Very clean, breakfast and maid service every morning, extremely comforable bed (a very important ammenity after traveling!!), and an added bonus balcony overlooking the town ro the sea. We were pleasantly surprised when our host, Mauro mentioned the breakfast, wine and limoncello was made by his family. Such a cute family business! We even ended up buying a bottle of homemade wine to drink during our stay, it was delicious. Highly recommend!","10817":"If you\u2019re going to Agrigento consider staying here! It was a perfect place for me and my son. First of all we were greeted by an extremely friendly host. Mauro gave us the rundown of the place with instructions on everything we needed to know. The place was large, extremely comfortable, and very very clean! It had just the right color and touches to make it adorable :-) the best part was that there was some complementary homemade marmalade, Italian olives, cheese, salami and wine waiting for us in the refrigerator. Not to mention a completely stocked kitchen for breakfast including fresh muffins and bread\u2019s and everything we needed for coffee, tea, and cereal. You definitely don\u2019t need to go out for breakfast because you can eat it here either in the cute kitchen or on the balcony overlooking the city. The room is on the 11th floor and has a very nice view. Finally, Mauro gave us some good suggestions on restaurants including the very best one of all which was, Pititto! Trust me, you definitely want to go to that restaurant. It\u2019s about a five minute walk from the B&B and out of the touristy trap :-) the food is excellent. I highly recommend staying at this B&B.","10818":"I cannot speak highly enough about this property and the hosts - excellent location, very clean, nice breakfast and hosts that care about their guests having a good stay in Agrigento :grin: We had a major issue during our stay and our hosts were more than proactive in helping us to get things sorted out","10819":"A great place to stay close to the centre of Agrigento and a short drive to the Valley of the temples. The rooms are bright and airy with everything you need. Breakfast was lovely and the boat helpful.and friendly. Highly recommended.","10820":"B&B\u5730\u5740\u5728\u5e02\u4e2d\u5fc3\uff0c\u5f00\u8f66\u53bb\u795e\u5e99\u548c\u571f\u8033\u5176\u9636\u68af\u90fd\u5f88\u65b9\u4fbf\uff0c15\u5206\u949f\u8f66\u7a0b\u5c31\u80fd\u5206\u522b\u62b5\u8fbe\u3002\u516c\u5bd3\u697c\u4e0b\u6709\u7a7a\u5730\u7528\u6765\u514d\u8d39\u505c\u8f66\uff0c\u6362\u4e2a\u65b9\u5411\u5c31\u662f\u5c0f\u57ce\u6700\u70ed\u95f9\u7684\u4e3b\u5e72\u9053\u3002House Keeper\u5c0f\u54e5\u975e\u5e38\u70ed\u60c5\uff0c\u5e2e\u6211\u4eec\u6307\u5bfc\u505c\u8f66\u5e76\u4ecb\u7ecd\u5468\u56f4\u7684\u9910\u5385\u4ee5\u53ca\u666f\u70b9\u3002\u623f\u95f4\u6709\u5f88\u597d\u7684\u89c6\u91ce\uff0c\u4ece\u9633\u53f0\u53ef\u4ee5\u770b\u5230\u795e\u5e99\u548c\u5c71\u5ce6\u3002\u8212\u9002\u53e4\u8001\u7684\u963f\u683c\u91cc\u771f\u6258\u5c0f\u57ce\uff0c\u63a8\u8350\u7ed9\u5927\u5bb6\u65b9\u4fbf\uff0c\u5e72\u51c0\uff0c\u8212\u670d\u7684B&B\uff0c\u662f\u975e\u5e38\u4e0d\u9519\u7684\u4f53\u9a8c\u5462\uff5e6\u6708\u4efd\u897f\u897f\u91cc\u7684\u5fae\u98ce\uff0c\u751a\u662f\u60ec\u610f\uff5eThe best & right place for short trip in Agrigento, we would definite want to choose the B&B next time if we go there. Such nice people and town for us to visit.","10823":"In Agrigento, we stayed at B&B Mira Valle, which is on the lower edge of the old city. A big plus was that we had an apartment that had a washing machine. While we weren't fans of the immediate area as it was a little run down and grimy, the apartment had fantastic views across the Valley of the Temples to the Mediterranean Sea. Parking was also relatively easy in the street at the front. The city is as all cities in Sicily, set on a rocky hill with very steep streets up to the Cathedral at the top. We thought this B&B was perfectly located with good but steep access to the main town streets where there were many restaurants and plenty of shops. It is also quite close to the railway station and bus stops. Our host Claudio was very attentive, the place very clean and food provided varied and generous (even to homemade wine and Limoncello).","10825":"A good B&B in an ideal accessible location for the old town and monuments with easy parking on the road outside. It is on 11th floor of an apartment building so has superb views from the balcony to the monuments and sea. The breakfast provided has some home made items with products from the owners family farm for sale.","10828":"Spotless apartment with everything you could need, including washing machine!! Comfortable bed, great Seaview, breakfast home cooked, excellent value! Close walk to main old centre of town & good restaurants. 3 kms to Ancient Valley of Temples.","10831":"We stayed for three nights at this wonderful B&B on the edge of old town Agrigento. We had a three room apartment - kitchen, bathroom and bedroom. Spacious, very clean, exceptional breakfast with fresh homemade pastries, and parking for our rental car. Our personable host was caring and checked in with us via e-mail often to make sure we had everything we needed wanted. Nice view of the sea and Valley of the Temples.","10832":"We were very pleased with the apartment and how we were greeted by Claudio. The apartment had fabulous views including the valley of the temples in the distance. Tastefully furnished and kitted out with excellent kitchen and huge bathroom. Claudio left us sandwiches, cakes and wine and range of options for breakfast. It was superb. Karen","10835":"My family selected B&B MiraValle as our lodging in Agrigento based on the previous reviews. Boy, we were not disappointed! The B&B is conveniently located within walking distance to numerous restaurants, bars and shops and a short drive to the Valley of the Temples and Turkish Steps. The room was very clean and comfortable and Mr. Claudio was a most helpful and gracious host. Breakfast included an assortment of delicious pastries made with marmalade from the local area. Parking can possibly be a bit of a challenge as you are required to park on the street but we were able to find a place nearby with no problems. We had a great experience and highly recommend.","10837":"I will be honest. We were not sure what to do when we first arrived at MiraValle. It is a large apartment building on busy street. We were buzzed in by Claudio and went up to 11th floor in an elevator of about three square foot. What an experience. The went into apartment and it was fantastic. It is very well spilt in two. One half is just a bedroom and bathroom and the other is a bedroom, bathroom and full kitchen. We had this suite. The bathroom is huge and the shower bigger than ones in most hotels we stayed. Hot water an an d great pressure. There is small patio off the bedroom that looks over the Valley of Temples and on down to the sea. Breath taking. Claudio, owner, met us, spent a lot of time explaining the area and sights. He has also made the appartment very cozy. In the fridge was a packed lunch for us. Very sweet of him. There was also homemade marmalade, pear jam, water and acarafe of their home made white wide. In the bedroom he also had a 220 110 electric converter - a very nice touch. The beds and pillows were very comfortable. I highly recommend MiraValle and thank you Claudio for a wonderful stay.","10839":"This is a great apartment with an amazing view. Like other visitors before us, we sat on the balcony with a glass of wine (left by our host) and watched the sunset. The suite itself is lovely, sparkling clean and very comfortable. Mauro, who greeted us and showed us around, was very helpful, recommending restaurants and places to visit. Our only regret: we only stayed one night. We should have stayed longer. We highly recommend this B&B.","10843":"This B&B was the best bargain we have ever found - we had a suite with a bedroom, terrace facing the Val dai Tempi where we could see the temples while enjoying breakfast, a separate kitchen, laundry facilities, and one of the largest bathrooms we have ever had, in many trips to Italy! Breakfast was more than sufficient, and Mauro was a great host. It is also easy to drive to (which in Italy is not always true of B&B's!) We cannot say enough good things about MiraValle!","10845":"Clean modern apartment with everything you need. We stayed here 2 nights and loved our stay. Great host with wonderful home made food. Super location with great restaurants nearby. Easy communication with Mauro.","10846":"My wife & I stayed here one night and had the same favorable experiences as other reviewers. Large, clean rooms with a view of the ocean. Homemade wine, jams and breakfast sweets. Short walk to the restaurant area. We had dinner at one recommended by Claudio that was excellent. There was a small clothes washing machine in the breakfast room which was a big plus.","10848":"While visiting the Valley of Temples, we spent one night in Agrigento at this B&B and we couldn\u2019t be more pleased.  The location is excellent. There\u2019s a view over the sea from this 11th storey balcony and the main walking shopping restaurants street is only one street over. The room was also very modern, nicely decorated and very clean.  As great as all that is, the highlight was the welcoming and generous attention we received from Claudio. He met us on arrival and immediately gave up his parking space for us. Once in the room, we were gifted some wine from his family\u2019s farm (we had the white from dark Nero D\u2019Avola grapes which was very nice), a couple of freshly made sandwiches which were appreciated after the drive, homemade jams jellies and homemade pastries. Amazing and so generous! And then there was also cereal, breads and coffee for the morning.  We highly recommend a stay here.","10850":"What a wonderful place to stay. 5 minute walk from the train station. The bus for the Valley of the Temples was also 5 minute walk from the square in front of the station. B and B Miravalle was spotlessly clean, the facilities amazing, super comfy bed and pillow, fridge, microwave 2coffee machines, kettle, 3 varieties of tea. The breakfast was enough to feed an army, a ham roll each, cornflakes,yoghurts toast, croissants, cakes and mousses, Claudio\u2019s mum had made, marmalade\u2019s she also made, delicious white wine his Gradfather had made, with grapes from their vine. Everything was perfect. Wonderful view from the balcony. Thankyou service, value and rooms 5star","10851":"Good location, closed to the center. Very nice apartment, everything what you need you can find here. Owner was very friendly. Will advise the place for my friends who will go to Sicily. Good view from balcony.","10853":"We stayed at B&B Miravalle Agrigento after a day out at the valley of temples and were welcomed by Mauro. He gave us a tonne of information and pointed out some recommended eats both in Agrigento as well as other places and his family made wine was very nice indeed which we were able to sample! Apartment was spotless and a great size, comfortable bed and all the amenities you could need. A shame we only stayed one night, very close to main street and great view from the bedroom window! A warning the lift is very small so will be hard to fit a whole family in there plus luggage. You'll need a couple of trips. We had two small suitcases and two people and only just got in. Street parking is available near by but do be alert! Some blocks around didn't feel too safe but that's the same with anywhere. Really recommend in any case!","10859":"The location is on a main street on the edge of town, so you get beautiful views over the Valley of the Temples, especially from the 11th floor where the suites are situated. However, the temples themselves are very far away so very hard to appreciate. There is street parking in several locations nearby, but there is no guarantee that you'll find a space. We were lucky to get the last space in the square nearby.  The host was at the apartment on arrival. He was very friendly, provided lots of information, and booked a local restaurant for us (that was very good).  Our room was very comfortable. It had a balcony and ensuite bathroom, and mini-kitchen amenities. It connected to a common room, shared with one other suite. We selected this arrangement because we had another party traveling with us.  Their suite had a separate bathroom across the hall, and we all shared a full kitchen dining area, with laundry. Both suites had air con. All the rooms were very nicely decorated.  The only downside was the tiny, slow elevator to go up 11 floors, but that's pretty normal for Italy.","10885":"B&B which is in the heart of the old town. There is parking in the town but not directly adjacent to the house which is in a very narrow street. The rooms are in the owner's home and sometimes we felt we were intruding on the family by being there. Agree with other comments that the room was basic but adequate and if being within walking distance of the old town is important for you, you will struggle to find anywhere closer. The family recommended some good local restaurants for us to use in the evening and they were excellent. The family have pets which we hadn't realised when booking.","10939":"The B&B is located on a narrow street, historical center of Agrigento. The room is very big, offers a window view to the sea and the terrace with jasmine smells was a great place for breakfast. The breakfast was quite good and served early. Our host, Mauro, was kind and available. Good price.  We arrived in the evening in Agrigento, after long day, so it seemed difficult to access through the street maze the place where the B&B is located, especially since we did not know there is no driving street access. The bed was a bit soft. It would be helpful to have a small table inside with chair for being able to write or arrange things. Free parking is potentially available, but you have to take a chance and pass the paid one first on one way street, we opted for the paid parking.","10979":"John E is spot on in his review of this charming B and B with the amazing views of the Valley of the Temples and also of the town of Agrigento, the latter especially at night. With a number of B and B stays now under my belt, this is one of the ones that stands out. A modern, clean room with good bedding (including pillows), bathroom and Wi-Fi was complimented by an outstanding breakfast, and tremendous service from the young couple who run the establishment.  You do not necessarily need a car. We came from Palermo by train and the walk from the station is not that far. The building is indeed next to a pharmacy. We paid in advance via Booking.com so cash versus credit cards were not an issue for us.","10981":"A B&B on the 12th floor of the building. Yes, there is an elevator. It was a little difficult to find. There is a Farmacia next door. When you get there ring the buzzer and the owners will come down to meet you.  The room was small but clean and quiet. They gave you 5 keys which gave you access to the building and the B&B. Breakfast was served in a sunroom on the terrace. A combination of hot and cold items with cappuccino and juices. You had access to this area anytime if you wanted a snack or such. The view from the terrace is great. You can see all the way to the Valle di Templi.  The hosts were pleasant and attentive. They DO NOT accept credit cards so be prepared with cash to pay for the room.","10992":"This BnB can hardly compete with any other un town! Firstly, location is great, it is only a 3 minutes walk away from the main street in the storical center and there is free parking available just in the building\u2019s door (hard to find in Sicily!). The BnB is on the last floor and has a great terrace which offers astonising views from the whole Valle dei Templi and the sea. The rooms are brand new, perfectly clean and delicately decorated. But the real goal of this BnB is their owners, Chiara and Lelo are incredibly gentle, they were always available to help and gave us a great amount of valuable information about the main attractions in town and places to eat or drink that didn\u2019t let us down. And last but certainly not least, a special mention has to be done about the ABSOLUTELY AMAZING sicilian breakfast they serve with great care. Each morning Chiara delighted us with different island specialities, both salted and sweet. It really can\u2019t be compared with any other breakfast we had so far in the whole country. Certainly a great choice!!!!","11005":"Very warm and welcoming hosts. Room was lovely with a balcony and view overbthe water. Breakfast was exceptional and everything freshly made daily by Kiara and Lello. Lello even drove us to the hus terminal. In the old town. Would highly recommend this lovely b & b.","11053":"We greatly enjoyed our two nights at the Magna Grecia. This is an oasis outside the hustle and bustle of Agrigento with the added bonus of a small outdoor pool which was exceptionally relaxing and welcome with daytime temperatures above 30 degrees. The rooms are nicely furnished (with the exception of the ceiling which needs a proper coat of paint), the beds extremely comfortable and the bathroom is modern and provides all that you need. But the real highlights are: 1. the breakfast with the freshly baked croissants, pancakes and homemade jams; 2. the pool; 3. the cats, dogs and goat (if you have young children); and 4. the very accommodating and chilled hosts. We stayed here due to the excellent reviews and did not regret our decision in the slightest!","11070":"The Terrazze di Montelusa is not a place where you just check-in and stay while you visit Agrigento! Once you get in the house, you become part of it and somehow part of the family! Francisco shows you around, you learn about the house, about the family and the town! And of course you are allowed to befriend and bond with Ginger and Pilu - the two house cats! The enthusiasm and dedication of Francisco are commendable. Francisco pretty much organized all our stay \u2013 arranged for parking at a discounted rate, suggested places to visit in town and how to get to the Valley of the temples and which which restaurants to go to. Breakfast was in the dining room at the last floor. It consisted in a mix of cheeses, cold cuts, boiled eggs, pastries, coffee and tea. At some point during breakfast, Francisco would show up with more fresh pastries and he would make sure that we taste them all. We travel a lot and love to stay in B&Bs, but the Terrazze di Montelusa was by far the best B&B we ever stayed in! We recommended without any hesitation to anyone visiting Agrigento!","11071":"We stayed here for two nights. We came to Agrigento (by car from Modica) to see the Valley of the Temples and the archeological museum. We wished we had stayed with Francesco and in Agrigento for longer.  Francesco was the most wonderful host. He was so helpful and welcoming after our long car journey (via Villa Romana), providing welcome expressos and freshly baked biscuits. We found Francesco's advice on how to visit the Valley of Temples (including which bus stop to get off at) extremely helpful. Francesco provided fantastic restaurant recommendations, and was so helpful with other sights to see in the area. He was also so interesting to talk to and we learned about Sicily in general.  Our room was perfect - a separate area for the bathroom and another separate area for our bags with a couch and desk; we appreciated the fridge with free mineral water. It was all very spacious and even better than the photos. Breakfasts were marvellous with freshly scrambled eggs, cheese, meats, cereals, yoghurts, cakes, fruit juices, whatever coffees you would like. One morning we sat outside amongst the cathedral spires and town - with views onto the Valley. It was the middle of winter so when the next morning was a little chilly we had breakfast in the lovely dining area. We would so love to come back to Agrigento and to stay here!","11075":"I cannot gush enough about this gem of a place in Agrigento. Housed on two floors of an old family casa, the property has an old world charm with modern conveniences. Our room was delightfully furnished and the bed was very comfortable. Our host Francesco, warmly welcomed us and saw to our every comfort. We had a choice of terraces to sit at for breakfast in the morning in the brilliant sunshine. We were very sorry that time constraints had only allowed us one night in Agrigento. Definitely a place to go back to.","11081":"The location is quite central for the old historic town, close to may restaurants and bars. The owner Francesco met us at the station, which was a kind gesture. We were allocated an apartment on the 2nd floor which had a separate bedroom bathroom, plus a lounge kitchen area, with cooking facilities (but didn't use), and a fridge. We had lots of wardrobe space in our room. There are other rooms on the same floor plus a suite on the top floor. There is also a communal terrace on the top floor where you can relax in the evening with a drink or two.  Breakfast is also taken on the top floor, where there is another outdoor terrace plus indoor seating. The breakfasts were ample, with lots of homemade cakes and biscuits, plus the usual savoury cold items.  Francesco provided us with useful information about what to see and do in the local area.","11086":"This B & B is a gem. Conveniently located within walking distance of the Main Street filled with shops and restaurants. If you are driving it is best to follow directions to park your car in the public garage which is walking distance to the B & B. Francesco is very accommodating and helped transport our luggage to and from the car. There is also a train station close by. There are two well groomed cats on premises. This did not present a problem to me; but might for some.","11088":"In Agrigento the crystal blue sky melts into blue sea. The city, sky, sea and three of the ancient temples can be seen from the terrace. Our suite was spacious with a modern bath. Pristine clean. Furnishings are carefully chosen, quietly elegant. The floors are palatial. Francesco is an excellent host. We arrived frazzled. A highway detour diverted us from our itinerary. We were fortunate to find a parking space, allowing us to locate the B&B on foot. With Francesco\u2019s directions we were able access the parking garage, nearby. Glasses of wine and cheese and a panoramic view of the city were waiting for us when we returned. Francesco\u2019s suggestion that we take a taxi to visit the Temples was good advice. He made the arrangements. Giovanna is pleasant and an experienced driver. This took all the stress out of the day. She returned to pick us up at a location near the end of our guided tour. (I left my hat in the taxi. Giovanna and Francesco, kindly, arranged for it\u2019s return.) Breakfasts are generous with many choices of bright, fresh seasonal fruits, pastries, yogurt and warm slices of frittata. Selections of prosciutto and cheese. All attractively presented. Coffee is made and served to order. The breakfast area was in bloom with cheerful, well-tended geranium. Terrazze di Montelusa is how I dreamed a vacation in Sicily would be.","11090":"We were completely happy with our stay at Terrazze di Montelusa. The rooms were elegant and beautifully appointed. Francesco was welcoming and helpful. The rooms were extremely clean and functional. Well done.","11095":"The host takes special pride in this B&B, since it is a family home that has been occupied for generations. The furnishings are museum-quality, and photos of ancestors line the halls. There are several terraces with views over the old city, and a charming breakfast room. Francesco is an excellent host, along with his two cats, Pilou and Gingerino. A few more specifics here that don't detract but should be taken into account: the drive to this B&B requires close attention to the directions Francesco provides. We also used GPS which was quite accurate, and with the combination were able to find the B&B with only one false turn. And the mattresses are quite hard, definitely to my liking but not necessarily to everyone's. But those are minor quibbles - this is a great place to stay and a great place to use as a base for exploring Agrigento.","11098":"This B&B is situated in the heart of old Agrigento, on the top two floors of a fine old house. We are very happy to recommend it as a good place to stay. Francesco our host (to say nothing of his two beautiful cats) was very welcoming and eager to help us. Our room comprised a bedroom, a bathroom, a sitting room, and a small private terrace. In addition, there are terraces on the top floor by the breakfast room, which give splendid views down to the Valley of the Temples. The whole place is splendidly furnished, and our room was very comfortable. There is no lift, but this did not bother us.  From the B&B it is only a short work to the Via Atenea, which is the main street in Agrigento, and a good place along which to amble, especially in the evening. We came by car, and were able to leave it in a nearby underground car park for a modest fee. However, the one-way systems in Agrigento are quite complex, and you should carefully plan your drive there in advance.","11100":"Well done on La Dimora del Capo's staff. Everything was handled with cure and fine details, furniture makes you at ease and the room was very comfortable. The toilet was sparkling clean! Vincenzo is a very good host with a natural instinct for this job. Definitely a highly recommended guest house! The location is just few steps off the historical centre.","11104":"We spent one night in this beautifully restored family run B&B. Francesco was an excellent host. Our room was spacious, clean, comfortable and quiet. Breakfast was served on a terrace overlooking the Valley of the Temples with the Mediterranean Sea in the background.","11105":"Hard to find anything negative to say! Francesco is charming, welcoming, informative, helpful... The house is just wonderful : the tasteful d\u00e9cor is in keeping with the old building's charm, the room was spacious, breathtaking views from the terraces, comfort, cleanliness etc just fine. A recommendation: use the public carpark because the tiny old streets are a challenge!","11108":"Francesco the 5th generation turn this lovely property into the most charming Bnb. He is charming, warm, helpful and a perfectionist.  Must admit that like all old cities parking is a pain but he has done every thing he can to help us  Be careful there is no lift but he helped us with our luggage  His reception area is a gem if u appreciate art and breakfast is just amazing  I could go on and on and in but a picture tells a thousand words so look at the photos below","11109":"Terrazze di Montelusa could not have been a better experience. Francesco is a stellar innkeeper, knows the area\u2019s sights, and knows the restaurants. We followed his recommendations and had a great time as a result. Also, the B&B is ideally located in the historic center of Agrigento, and has good access to a conveniently located, secure, and affordable parking garage just down the hill. Also, the breakfasts are generous, fresh and delicious. This inn is without question the best of Agrigento!","11112":"What a place to stay! Perfect spot, 5 minutes walk from centre of Palermo. Lovely clean big rooms with air con. Private clean large bathroom. Fantastic breakfast every day. But what makes this place special are the people. Vincenzo and especially Myriam. The perfect hosts, who cater for your every wish. They give you tips advice and knowledge on the best places to see, eat and drink. They are always happy and Myriam makes a mean cake!!!!!! We loved our stay at La Dimora Del Capo.","11113":"We loved our stay here. Only one night but so special. Our host Francesco was so friendly and gracious, even played the piano for us. Lovely views, furnishings, art and a beautiful, comfortable room. Great value too. Thank you Francesco for a short but sweet stay at your lovely B & B. Highly recommended!","11117":"Everything about this B&B was wonderful. Francesco, our host was charming and delightful, the rooms eclectic and immaculate, the breakfasts were served on the lovely terrace with beautiful views. We stayed 2 nights (September 28th-29th) and wished for more. V Kaye","11123":"I\u2019m not sure I can add any new information to all the positive reviews about this wonderful B&B. The atmosphere is refined and peaceful and friendly. It is decorated with not only beautiful artwork and furniture, but also with lovely old photos of Francesco\u2019s ancestors. Our room was spotless,large, and well appointed with nice linens and towels. The breakfast offerings included yogurts,fresh fruit, prosciutto, cheese, scrambled eggs, Pastries,toast, coffees,tea and juice. One morning Francesco distributed fresh Ricotta that was absolutely superb. Breakfast on either of the beautiful flowered terraces or the charming indoor breakfast room was an unforgettable experience. Francesco is the ultimate host, knowledgeable, patient, warm and clearly cultured. We were treated to his piano playing one which added to the ambiance of the overall experience. I cannot say enough about this outstanding B& B. We spent 3 nights here and wish it could have been longer. I highly recommend Terrazze di Montelusa. Thank you Francesco for making our stay so very memorable. Judy from Arizona","11129":"B & B Terrazza di Montelusa is a charming, elegant, beautifully restored and beautifully furnished B & B in the heart of historical old town Agrigento... Francesco is a delightful host, staying here is like being welcomed into a beautiful family home. Our room was huge , comfy,bright & light, sparkling clean, lovely big bathroom, large fluffy white towels. Breakfast was a treat.. fresh fruit ( ripe to eat now) freshly cooked omelette, delicious pastries, cheese,prosciutto etc coffee,tea,juice - the breakfast room is so so pretty - we enjoyed eating on the terrace with sweeping views to the sea and 'Valley of the Temples'. Just magic Francesco is full of wonderful helpful information, good restaurant recommendations. One night here was not long enough - Thank you Francesco for making our stay in Agrigento special.","11133":"We loved our stay at La Dimora del Capo. The location of the B&B is great, you are right next to he city center. Also, the Il Capo market is a 5 min walk (or even less). The people working there are amazingly kind, welcoming and they make you feel like home. The rooms are spacious, clean and very silent, so you can take a good rest. And the greatest thing was the breakfast!! We ate very good all along Sicily, but this breakfast was by far the best. The prepare local things, they even baked a cake for us. We loved it!","11146":"Difficult to find amid narrow one way streets but worth the effort. Follow directions carefully. Call if you are lost. Don\u2019t give up. Also two and 3 flights up, no lift. Don\u2019t give up. This is an exceptional B&B value with a friendly caring owner proud of his family heritage and beautifully furnished place. Three rooftop terraces with amazing views. Excellent breakfast and service. Room 301 is the best. Book it if available. Very good inexpensive local Ristorante downstairs. Francesco will advise you on parking. Valley of the Temples is a must and so is this B&B.","11149":"We stayed here for two nights. Franceso, the owner, was a very helpful host with great restaurant and sightseeing recommendations. The B&B is located in the historic district, which is on a steep hill. We parked in a nearby parking garage and took buses back forth to the Valley of the Temples, because driving in Agrigento is challenging. The B&B has been beautifully renovated. Our room was on the top floor, looking out onto the small square in front of the hotel, with its own balcony down the hall. The breakfast was scrumptious, on another balcony with a beautiful view. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to stay in the town's historic district. But if you don't like to walk up and down hills or drive into an area with narrow streets, this may not be the place for you.","11152":"Perfect place to arrive and to stay. Francesco is a very kind and entertaining host, B&B is beautiful, rooms are big and tastefully furnished. Beds are comfortable, bathrooms big and well equipped Breakfast very good! Everything perfectly clean and well kept We would have liked to stay much longer, one night just wasn't enough! We'll be back - I hope!","11154":"The hosts are very friendly and helpful. They gave me many good advices about Palermo visit. The location is central. The rooms are big and clear, it's situated in a very nice building. I love this place.","11155":"We arrived at Terrazza di Montelusa later than expected and rather exhausted after a stressful time driving into Agrigento and becoming lost in the one-way streets! Our lovely host Francesco was so calm and reassuring however, and drove us back to our car to lead us to a suitably located parking station. Our room was huge, tasteful and elegant, with a little balcony looking over the square, and it was a treat to have such a spacious bathroom! A lovely breakfast was served in an elegant dining room upstairs, with great views from the terrace over the city and down to the Valley of the Temples. Francesco was an exemplary host, giving us help and advice with so many things. His B&B is a peaceful and special experience as well as being a haven from the bustling town around it.","11157":"A lovely place, clean , great location and a wonderful host Francesco who gave us great tips to visit the city. Amazing view of the valley of temples Big and healthy breakfast Highly recommended for a stay in area","11163":"Francesco is a wonderful, wonderful host. His B&B is located close to the city center, so an evening walk was in order. The room was very comfortable, the shower and bathroom terrific. Best of all was breakfast on the terrace looking out at the sea. Grazie mille, Francesco!","11168":"We stayed three nights at this wonderful B&B in Agrigento. Francesco is an outstanding host. We felt extremely welcome and perfectly at home in his beautiful house. He was very helpful with advice on visiting the Valley of the Temples and the other sites in Agrigento. He also gave us excellent recommendations for restaurants and gelaterias. Our room was spacious and beautifully appointed. There is a roof terrace that is always open for guests to enjoy the views as well as another two terraces where the sumptuous breakfast buffet is served. The view from there is spectacular. Agrigento is very hilly but everything is within easy walking distance from the B&B. We loved it.","11169":"This is the kind of place you hope to find: stylish, but comfortable, with a great location & service.  The place has been in the family for 4 generations. The B&B was renovated about 5 years ago. The renovation retained its historic style & charm but added modern plumbing & infrastructure. My room was large and well furnished -- personality and comfort. It was quiet at night & great for sleeping. It's in the historic center within easy walking distance to restaurants, gelato, shops, and the city bus to the Valley of the Temples.  Francesco Foti, the manager owner, provides friendly, excellent, personal service. He'll help you figure out what when how to tour the sites.  Unambivalently recommended!","11171":"We had a large bedroom with a big open window, big bathroom (with window), a sitting room, a fridge, and a private terrace. Of the eight hotels we stayed at during our drive through southern Sicily, this was the best value. I was a bit wary because Mr. Francesco Foti, the owner, sent a preparatory email that was quite strict and I was afraid we might offend him, but he turned out to be the soul of hospitality'. He has two beautiful cats in the B&B but they are kept in Mr. Foti's office unless they are invited out. Mr. Foti came out to the street to help us with our car and actually parked it himself in a tiny space where we could leave it (free) for 2 nights. Breakfast (cheese, ham, tomatoes, quiche, apple tart, cookies, marzipan, and a special cooky made with musto, a concentrate of grapes, cappuccino) was served as a buffet on the top floor with tables inside and outside with a view of the city and the sea. Our favorites in Agrigento, aside from visiting the Valley of Temples, were a 4-storey gallery down the hill from the B&B with an adjacent room of Sicilian puppets, the church of Santa Maria del Greci, and the Birreria near the pedestrian promenade. Note: as in all the towns we visited, things close up at night, so get your snacks, water, and beer in the morning.","11178":"We were 4 friends traveling Western Sicily and stayed at this marvelous property for 2 nights to visit the Valley of the Temples. It is so rare to find a B&B that hits every mark: location, view, beauty, charm and that special feeling that you have entered the home of a welcoming friend. Francesco is a warm, cultivated art lover and the large, comfortable rooms and common areas reflect both his impeccable taste and his family line, which is interesting in and of itself. He is such fun to chat with, and if you are as lucky as we were, he will sit at the piano and play for impromptu singalongs. The staff made us feel that we were privileged guests, too, and served up a delightful breakfast which can be eaten in the lovely outdoor spaces or in the cozy dining room. Walk outside the inn, turn left and down a little street (which has a produce grocery store that is handy for snacks) and you are on the main street in Agrigento. We visited churches, museums and the gorgeous Pirandello Theater on our first day and the Temples the next, so 2 nights worked perfectly. A highlight of our 3 weeks in Sicily!","11185":"It's always a pleasure returning to this charming little B&B in the center of Agrigento. Over the past 10 years it has become kind of a home away from home. Francesco goes the extra mile to make your stay comfortable and is a real charmer and Wikipedia for Agrigento and the area. It's a bit tricky to find the place, but Francesco gladly helps you. Rooms are clean and have every comfort you expect from a B&B. Fantastic rooftop terrace, where you can just relax, enjoy the view over the city and the Valley of the Temples and enjoy a great breakfast. Will surely be back soon again!","11193":"A handsome property, with spacious and well-furnished rooms. It is spotlessly clean and in perfect condition and is in a conveniently central location. An excellent and comprehensive breakfast is served and the host is most helpful.","11196":"First, the owner Francesco is an extremely welcoming, sincere, knowledgeable and professional individual. He is passionate about Agrigento, history and art and was very helpful with parking, giving directions and making suggestions about visiting nearby places. The place is extremely beautiful, full of wonderful antiques and paintings carefully and thoughtfully chosen by him. He was very attentive to our needs and always took the time to answer our questions, without rushing us at all. Breakfast is excellent, full of delicious pastries, fruit, cheese and juices. The highlight for us were the terraces... the views are amazing and the terraces are full of plants and flowers. After a long day of touring around, we would often come here to relax and marvel at the views. This is an ideal location to visit Valley of the Temples or Scala dei Turchi, and it is right in town so you can walk easily to restaurants, cafes and shops. There is also a great grocery conveniently located just next door if you want to pick up some fruit, cheese or cold cuts for lunch. We loved this place and highly recommend it to anyone visiting Agrigento.","11238":"The man who runs the B&B is very kind and accommodating. Has a beautiful view from the outside and a great breakfast. It's a laid back kind of place.  My room was simple and smaller with a few little flies coming in but honestly the host was so nice I didn't mind for the price. Everything is super clean and also the bathroom was newly remodeled.","11242":"Although we only stayed for 1 night, this terrific place made quite an impression. I've never met a host like Vincenzo, what a nice guy! He and his family have build a B&B that looks amazing and where they simply do everything to make you feel welcome and on holiday. Nothing but respect!  If you want to visit the Vallei dei Templi, look no further!","11302":"It was a little hard to find, in a residential area, but once we did it was fine. There is gated parking. Room accommodations were basic but clean.Breakfast was simple: great cappuccino, juice, croissants and yogurt..The location was good as it is not far from the Valley of the Temple. The price was truly budget with great value. Don't expect a Hilton but quite adequate.","11375":"This place is not easy to find. It is in a building that you get to either by taking stairs up from the main street or down from the back street. If you are driving up the back street look for a sign that says Hotel. It is where the road makes a slight turn. The stairs down to the B&B are next to it. Since we are old the man at the desk even carried our bags to and from the street. The B&B itself is nice, in a Baroque style.","11381":"We booked into La Dolce Vita for two nights as we wanted to see the Valley of the Temples and this accommodation caught our eye  Yes the rooms are done in a baroque style each named for a King of the period. We stayed in Louis XIV aka the sun king.  There is a canopy above the extremely comfortable bed, the flat screen TV had a golden frame round it. There was a painting of Louis in the room. All in all from a non experts view very well done and fun in my opinion. Bathroom fine soap, shampoo and shower gel provided. Breakfast is delivered to the room and it is extensive.  The B&B is no more than 5 mins from the train station. It should be noted access to the place is via steps and could be difficult to anyone with walking difficulties.  One minor problem and it only became apparent as my partner drinks a large amount of tea in the morning, is that there was a kettle and tea but no cups, it could have been an oversight we didn't ask as we were only there two nights.  I would have no hesitation recommending this as a place to stay and the decor is the icing (gilt paint) on the top  The host Dario speaks excellent English and is extremely helpful.","11382":"Sleeping like King Louie (Luigi) XIV - what an experience. Much focus on detail, even though bathroom is not the most functional one, but who cares with such a nice decoration? Breakfast is served in the room. Car could be parked quite close, small walk to the city center even though the center is not a must, stayed here mostly for the ruins. Enjoyed our stay","11386":"This accommodation is excellent, the location is next to the town centre. Lots of places to eat and drink if required. The owner of the place is very helpful and helped us with our bags on arrival and parking advice. The rooms are set up in a bygone era which is great. Bathroom clean and tidy good shower, bed is comfortable and pillows good. All things you need when traveling. Breakfast is provided. Good internet. I would recommend this B&B to travellers to this area. Just be aware parking is at a premium in area in the morning. Late afternoon and early evening it\u2019s ok before the local come out to eat .","11389":"the room looks like on the pictures! very cool and stylish. room is big and bed is comfortable. the wifi (felipe room) does not work when sitting in the bed just when standing in the hallway. this should be fixed with a 2nd router in the room. breakfast was served on the balcony and was yummy for 7\u20ac person. Room had air con but we didn't use it. parking in the street below is easy. very friendly and helpful owner staff.","11391":"It could be that staying on a Saturday night was not wise. The B & B is right above a popular restaurant so the noise from that and the cafes outside the window kept us up until 1:00 am. Sunday night was a bit quieter. The rooms are nicely decorated but getting to the B & B requires going up or down stairs so carrying your luggage can be challenging. Other than that, the location to town center was great. Breakfast is served in your room on a tray and even though the food was good, eating was a bit awkward.","11456":"We have discovered the Hotel Tre Torri during our planning of our trip to Southern Italy & Sicily. We were looking for a hotel close to the Valley of the Temples and it has an adjacent parking lot. This hotel is exactly what we were looking for. Situated in the suburbs of the city and not at the center of it which allowed us an easy and convenient exit to the valley. The hotel is very nice, spacious, clean rooms (refurbishment or renovation will not hurt at all). Good and varied breakfast and dinner, nice and welcoming staff. Recommended.","11487":"He was so helpful. As we arrived, he explained all about where and how to visit places in Palermo. He kept the apartment beautiful and clean. So nice to be served breaskfast on the top floor terrace in the sun. On the day we were leaving, Pope was visiting the city. The whole town was blocked; no bus nor taxi to go to the bus stop which was moved to far off place instead of the terminal inside the Stazione. He gave us full information about it to cancel the bus tickets, which they refused to refund but I appealed about the situation of the city and got refund, and bought train tickets. If not with his help, we might have walked over 30 minutes with luggages. Thank you, Giovanni!","11500":"After looking at many options for a short stay in Palermo we opted for PalermiTamo Apartment and we weren't disappointed. Giovanni met us upon our arrival and assisted in getting us settled. Everything worked as advertised including a great air conditioning unit. Breakfast was continental with many choices. We definitely will stay here on our next visit to Palermo.","11502":"We stayed here two nights in June, the room was average, bathroom very nice. The upstairs breakfast and balcony area was lovely and the overall location for walking everywhere was good. However it is right above two or three very noisy bars - ear plugs were supplied by the lovely and attentive owner beside the bed. However the noise travels through the fabric of the building especially as we were overlooking the street. The apartment is on the 3rd and 4th floors and the stairs are tight - not good for heavy baggage. We wanted to stay longer in Palermo so had to find other accommodation as PalermiT'amo was full. Found a very nice spacious hotel nearby for slightly less than the price of this apartment. It pays to shop around!","11506":"We spent just few days in August and it was fantastic. Location is close to movida and such typical area like ballar\u00f2 market and the pedestrian zone of the city center. Over the expectation. Highly recommended","11546":"The hotel has definitely seen better days (the plating has worn off most of the bathroom fittings). Our room was dingy, noisy, with mould in the shower, bits of skirting broken off and with an unattractive view across a car park towards the rear of a chinese restaurant. We complained and were promised a different room the next day. However, we didn't do that because we had meanwhile gone to explore the area around the hotel, which is in an awful area, next to 2 busy roads with partial bits of pavement, strewn with litter and dog poo, and lined with closed shops. We decided to leave the next day. You need a car to get away from the place, or indeed go anywhere, the taxis are expensive and the bus service intermittent. The pool area is nice, so if you have children and want to stay there all day, and can keep your eyes closed to the area you are in, you might be able to stand it. The shame of it is that the staff are very helpful, and the linen and cleaning service are excellent. The hotel looks fine if you look at it on Google Earth street view, unfortunately the interior isn't. We went there with the Ryanair Holidays, who don't seem to have much to do with Ryanair apart from booking the flights.","11550":"A fabulous B & B in a great location. Rooms are spacious and very clean. The terrace is delightful, especially for breakfast. There's also a comfortable sitting room and kitchen for use any time of day or night. The host, Giovanni, is wonderful. He goes way beyond what is expected. Nothing is too much trouble. There's nothing negative to say about this property at all. Thank you Giovanni for making out 8 day stay so enjoyable.","11586":"Stayed here one night. Owner is very friendly and helpful. Located in an alley, stairs only way to access the place.  Our room was large and located on entrance floor. A bit \u201ccold\u201d in the way lightning was applied. A small window, no view. Bed ok but personally I prefer a harder bed. They got more rooms (better?) on upper floor.  Great breakfast included. WiFi is free of charge.  The place has no parking so this needs to be fixed, can be tricky in this town.","11599":"We\u2019re so lucky to find this property for our trip. Our host, Vincenzo and Alessandro, is very kind and helpful gentlemen. They helped us to discover Agrigento, ranging from local attractions to Sicilian cuisine! Recommendations is just part of the positive things we have during our stay.  About the location it is located in the heart of Agrigento, a few minutes walk from the train station and bus station. Plenty of restaurant and cafe nearby, perfect!  Plenty of artwork by their mom, it\u2019s just like living in the gallery. Cleanliness and tidiness is another positive feature, not to mention you\u2019ll have a fantastic breakfast prepared by the host. And very warm-hearted gift when you check-out.  I would like to say thanks to them for everything and would recommend to stay in this fantastic b&b.","11619":"We stayed here for 5 days last year and thoroughly enjoyed the trip. The B & B is part of an old building but once inside the decor and ambience are super. There is no lift but you always get help with luggage. In fact the team here cannot do enough to help. They are friendly, welcoming and always happy to suggest places to eat, things to do, public transport etc. We tried out several of their recommendations (not there long enough to do see everything!) and they were all spot on, especially the local restaurants. The other big plus, apart from the lovely room and warm welcome, is the location. The apartment is right in the centre of everything, on the main street through the old town, yet not noisy at all. Parking is a bit of a problem but again the owners managers came to our aid and got us sorted. Thouroughly recommend this little gem.","11623":"We stayed at The B&B Gallidoro in September and from the moment their driver picked us up at the airport until he dropped us off, we cannot praise them enough. Don't be put off by the rather shabby exterior, once you get inside it is a stylish and chic building with beautiful and spacious rooms.","11624":"A central B&B in the heart of the historical centre of Palermo, just minutes away on foot from I Quattro Canti junction and major sites. Our room was spacious, clean and comfortable with coffee and tea making equipment, a small fridge and an AC. Breakfast was continental including a fresh warm croissant, fruit, cereal and cold cuts. Our hosts Massimo, Chiara and Alessio were helpful and gracious. Only negative aspect is that the B&B is situated in a run down block and for those who might have mobility problems or carrying large luggage, beware that there is no lift in the block. If staying in Palermo, look no further - this is the place to be!","11644":"A lovely BandB two minutes walk from Quattro canti junction. Lovely bedrooms and en suites and great breakfast included in the price. And extremely good value as well. Only downside is the traffic noise, but that\u2019s inevitable staying in the middle of the city.","11655":"Stayed 3 nights in suite at 40e a night. Perfect location. Good heating. Big bathrooms. High quality fittings and furnishings, as per website photos. Just a very comfortable stay. M\u00e1ssimo a very hospitable host too. Speaks English. SYAY HERE! They have very high ratings for a reason","11661":"It's difficult to assign a rating for this place, because I hardly think there are perfect accomodations and because there are a couple of flaws, but I don't want to penalize it either. If you read the other reviews and looked at the pictures you can get a pretty good feeling of the place.  The B&B is run by a family, they practically do everything that's to be done for the place - and I mean everything (cleaning, preparing breakfast) - personally and they are very attentive to each detail and try always to be helpful. The apartments are situated in an old palermitan house, are indeed renewed, and isolated from the rest of the house with many doors that make the place quite safe. A rich breakfast can be arranged for 3E per person and is served in a common room. The two owners that we met, Massimo and Alessio, were ready to give suggestions of things to do or places to eat, helped with the baggages, and promptly solved a problem with the drainage of the shower. The rooms are beautifully decorated, are cleaned every day, provided with courtesy set, air conditioning and minifridge. Wifi speed is good.  However, there are a couple of things to note, even if not fault of the owners: - being in the historical center, parking is hard to find and costs 5E daily - the apartments are part of a historical building on the second floor, there are not elevators in order to get to them - our apartment felt a little too small, we did not really have a lot of space to place things, for instance the only table is a tiny one where the tv is placed","11674":"Il Gallidoro is a gem for so many reasons. Here are some of them...  Location: I was traveling by train, and Palermo Centrale was about 500m from il Gallidoro. Likewise, it was just a few blocks from Quattro Canti, the crossroads of the city and close to the Norman Palace, the cathedral, and the Teatro Massimo.  Room: My room was very spacious and so was the well-fitted bathroom. Both were spotlessly clean, and my balcony overlooked the neighborhood church. Amazing value for money.  Staff: The whole family was gracious, helpful and friendly. The walking tour they mapped out for me was spot-on. They sent me to cool places for arancini and authentic palmerese cannoli. The nearby restaurant they recommended for dinner was great; fixed price antipasto buffet and lots of wonderful fish choices on the menu.  Breakfast: Plentiful and varied; lots of fresh ingredients; very nice breakfast room.  The wifi was a bit intermittent from time to time, but no big deal.","11676":"Alphonso and Josephine were the best hosts. Alphonso met us on the street as we were checking in late, made a phone call to a family member I was late to meeting with, put us in the very nice Blue Room, all with verve and \u2018calmo\u2019. In the morning, Josephina laid out the most amazing breakfast - be sure to select as little as possible when you check in b c there is SO much and it is SO good. We wish we had stayed longer. Next time!","11678":"The family that runs this B&B are so helpful and thoughtful. They picked us up at the airport, spent a lot of time showing us where things were that we wanted to see and when we could not find a tour group that would drive us to the Villa Romana del Casale, they drove us there. The rooms are very clean and comfortable. The breakfast is fantastic. We had never been to Sicily and they made us feel so at home.","11679":"Alfonso and Josephine were amazing hosts! They spoiled us rotten with an abundance of food, recommendations, and tastes of Marsala! They were so friendly and warm. Our room was large and beautiful. Small balcony with a street view. The location was perfect - right in old town Agrigento. The breakfast was ridiculously huge and so good! What we couldn't finish they kindly gave us a takeaway bag to bring with us on our day trips, which was so generous. I can't rave enough about this place, the delicious food, and the kindness they showed us. I highly recommend staying here.","11682":"Room was good sized, light and spotlessly clean. Hosts bent over backward for guests. As mentioned by others, breakfast is over the top...a bit too much over the top for our tastes. Parking car was uber easy - a huge plus in Agrigento, but location has a downside. To reach main area with cafes and restaurants means a climb down and, of course, a climb up after a meal and perhaps a beer wine or two. Hot water in shower was difficult to control and pressure was not strong. Wish they supplied a standard bar of soap instead of the tiny ones used. Bed was very comfortable.","11687":"Hospitality is terrific. A clean and attractively decorated place. Breakfast delicious and far more than ample. Located on a narrow street near the cathedral, many steep steps through a maze of winding pedestrian streets from restaurants and other amenities. Two minor annoyances: Wash basin drain was plugged up when we arrived. Hair dryer supplied was non-functional.","11697":"My wife and I needing to escape the gloom of England in January booked seven nights via Expedia. The room was lovely. Small balcony overlooking the street. Spotless bathroom, cleaned every morning to an excellent high standard. Nice new bed. Free WiFi. The room also has a small fridge to keep your drinks and snacks cool. Room also has kettle and cups and tea bags. TV is Italian TV and radio channels only. This was not a problem for us as we wanted to forget about Brexit. The breakfast is served from 7:30 - 9:30 each morning. Breakfast was pastries, cakes, fruit, yoghurt, cereals and cold meat and cheese. Toasters also for toast. Hot drinks made freshly to order by Massimo or one of his excellent team. Staff really friendly with local tips. You need to contact the B&B a day or two before just to confirm when you estimate you\u2019ll be checking in, as they don\u2019t operate a 24 7 reception. You let yourself in with a set of keys. Its all very simple and well explained. The location is great for old Palermo. Not too far from the central train station and airport bus stop at the central station. Just 10 minutes walk with luggage. Palermo\u2019s free circular city bus also stops very close to the B&B and it runs regularly. Also close to several UNESCO buildings. Loved the Jesuit church almost behind the B&B, a baroque masterpiece and the old markets. Also loved the cathedral at Monreale, Mondello beach for walking, and the area around the Porta Novo and San Francesco church area of streets and houses. All very close by. I hope you enjoy Palermo as much as we did. Ive also reviewed a couple of cafes and restaurants too.","11710":"Wonderful modern room in 18th century building! Massimo, Alessio, Fabio & Chiara all bent over backwards to assure we had everything we wished for. Their recommendations for restaurants, sightseeing, etc. were great. Breakfast was elegant & substantial.","11728":"Great hosts,pleasant,helpful and friendly.Fantastic location,highly recommended.Entrance into the place is little deceiving,but soon you realise that it is an old palace,charming and welcoming.Place is on pedestrians only street,packed with many great restaurants and 10 minutes walk from Central Station.","11735":"I stayed here for one night in August 2017 with my husband and 14-month-old daughter. The family that runs this B&B is so kind and warm. The son spoke good English and the daughter drove us to the airport (small charge for this but better value and service than a taxi). The room is spacious for what you're paying per night. The breakfast was filling, but that's probably because I just kept eating toast and croissants with the amazing pistachio spread on it. Their coffees were delicious as well! They provided a nice crib for my daughter. The location was good as it was close to many attractions in the city. The B&B is located up several flights of stairs in a somewhat dodgy building. But you'll get a set of keys for the multiple doors (you definitely feel safe once you're inside).","11739":"This place is lovely. Impeccably clean, well kept, nice atmosphere, nice rooms. Staff is amazing, they are so nice, helpful and smily. They helped with everything I needed and were very friendly. Wifi works perfectly, breakfast is AMAZING!!!! The property is super close to almost all famous places in Palermo. I'd definitely come back and recommend.","11780":"Great stay on our last day in Sicily, with Georgio so helpful with our bags, car and restaurant recommendations. Very clean and lovely property. Great location. Loved Palermo, will definitely be back.","11782":"Myself and partner stayed here for 3 nights, overall a pleasant experience. The owner was very accommodating and helpful with directions ect. We had a small apartment which was modern very clean and comfortable. The only downside was it was very noisy we could hear the people upstairs running round. But that was a small price to pay for this wonderful experience in Palermo.","11804":"We really enjoyed our stay here despite the many stairs you need to walk up to get to third (I seem to remember) floor. The staff are very helpful and carry your bags up though. The ensuite room was clean and airconditioned, with tea and coffee making facilities. Breakfast is had at a communal table and consists of the usual fayre plus a daily home-made cake which was a different flavour every morning. We enjoyed our morning chats with Davide, one of the two young men on the staff. The location is excellent. Turn right out of the B&B and you can walk into town or take the free shuttle bus. Turn left and you can walk to the marina and have a drink or meal in one of the places along the front.","11806":"We spent the last few nights of a two week trip around Sicily at the Abatellis Luxury B&B, and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Davide was extremely helpful when we arrived, helping with our luggage (it's a 2nd floor walk-up) and helping me park our rental car nearby. The room, in a few hundred year old building, was beautifully renovated and extremely comfortable. The location is excellent, a block from the waterfront, and a few blocks walk from great restaurants, museums, parks, shopping, etc. Would definitely stay here again.","11808":"This is a great little B&B in the heart of Palermo on via Alloro which is within easy walking distance of the city centre and the stop for free bus service that runs throughout the day is just down the road. The rooms are spacious and the breakfast is generous. The only downside for some might be the 4 flights of stairs to the apartments but otherwise this is an ideal location for visiting Palermo.","11964":"Four of stayed for 2 Nights two weeks ago. Arrived late - lovely young lady had waited to welcome us and show us our rooms. Nice, Spotless rooms with excellent bed linen. We went for a stroll and a late drink in a bar close by. When we returned, very late, Guiseppe was sitting outside and welcomed us - really with open arms . What a character! Next day we collected a hire car and he parked it for us. Free Mini Bar and when we went out site seeing the next day, he made sure we had water soft drinks to take. We sat and had FREE WINE, which was excellent - before going to local restaurant, very good too. On leaving, he got our car - gave us FREE drinks for our journey. Unbelievable ! Guisseppe with the Big Heart, we will be back for longer next time. Thank you and your lovely staff. from Valerie","11966":"Our stay was four nights. We arrived early and our room was still 30 mins away so Giuseppe sat us down and prepared coffee for us. The hospitality continued unabated. The area is fabulous. Close to everything and quite safe. The narrow streets are extremely well lit and we felt secure walking home at night. Aircon and wi fi are excellent.","11988":"Yes it\u2019s hard to locate but as previous person states look for the pharmacy. Once inside you will not be dissapointed. It\u2019s as the pictures show super clean , comfy beds gorgeously decorated with everything you need and if not Salvatore would only be to happy to accommodate. A wonderful daily fresh breakfast served with a smile and always interesting conversations. Thank you we had such an amazing 3 days a home away from home. The old city is a 2 minute walk and the views from the windows to the temples at night are lovely. Parking was right out front. Perfect stay! Thank you Salvatore :ok_hand:","12061":"We came 1 day later than we planned and the owner was so nice that he prolonged our stay without us asking! We had to lave as planned, however this was a very nice surprise. The location is very good, the AC and WiFi work well and the sleeping area was clean and comfortable. We were able to park for free vert close to the hotel. I would do some renovation in the bathroom, but other than that we are very happy with our stay!","12067":"Black mould in rooms, very old and bad kept. Needs a renovation soon. Of course, the owner was very kind and helpful with regards to everything. Breakfast was OK. There is no parking available though.","12090":"I booked this for a group of 5 of us.  The sleeping facilities were fine. Comfortable bed, clean cotton linens. We slept well. Breakfast, which was included was also fine, with choice of cereals, fruit, cheese and ham, egg, croissants (all sugar coated, when I prefer mine plain) and buns. When we asked for a hairdryer, they brought what was required. The location was also very good. Although it is an upward walk (40 minutes)from the museum and Valley of the Temples, most hotels are at the top of the hill, where all the restaurants are. It is also possible to get a taxi or a bus from the bottom to the top. Parking was on the street, but we found availability.  However, I was totally put off by the bathroom (see pictures) and the black mould. It felt yukky. They should really put new mastic on. As we didn't think it was a quick fix, we did not communicate our dissatisfaction. The single room had a new shower and, although small, it did not have black mould.","12092":"correct basic rooms, lift, small lobby with very weak evening keeper tiny breakfast room, too small for the number of residents not a pleasant street but quiet, close to a large boulevard with good view","12093":"We have just stayed for one night at the Cosmopolitan B&B. The location in the very city centre is a perfect base camp for sightsseing as well as for dinner and nightlife. The B&B is in modern style - very neat and clean. Beds are comfortable, bathroom of an acceptable size. Aircon avialable (important!). The breakfast is not only Italian style (cornetti only), but also with fresh fruit, toast and a small variety of cheese and others. The price performance ratio is unbeatable! The contact to the host is very easy and friendly. Thank you, Manfredi for having such a lovely place to stay.","12095":"Located in the hearth of Palermo city center, the b&b Cosmopolitan has very cozy rooms and a charming common area with an awesome view to Piazza Borsa. The structure is at walking distance from the main Palermo tourist attractions but at the same time is not too noisy. Staff is lovely and always available. I would definitely recommend this place :)","12161":"We spend 3 nights at Hotel del Viale. The staff was very helpful and service minded. Breakfast was average and the coffee was good. Room was cleaned every day and towels changed every day. We had one of the rooms with a balcony which was nice. Ask for this when you book.","12211":"The pictures at the website are far different from the real hotel. Our room wasn\u00b4t properly cleaned, the safe and the shower weren\u00b4t working; we complained at the reception but nothing was done about it. The bed wasn\u00b4t comfortable and the sheets were stained. They\u00b4re definitely not a 5 stars hotel!  Pros: The hotel staff is good (Salvador is helpful and welcomed us with a drink); the breakfast is very well served in other space out of the hotel and it\u00b4s really nice. The hotel is very close to the museums and temples that certainly worth a visit. They have a private parking.  Cons: Old and small room, umcomfortable bed; stained sheets; small toilet; old furniture.","12218":"Arrived for a night stay while touring Sicily, on arrival we were spoiled by the wonderfully friendly reception. We were given a local drink and cake as a welcome, which was lovely. The hotel is by the coast but also in a fantastic position for visiting the valley of the temples. We went into the square and were rewarded with very friendly people, great negroni and treats. The hotel is lovely very clean tidy with great rooms, we were on the top floor looking out to sea. Great room and fantastic price. The breakfast was lovely, fresh with local goodies and great coffee. I also enjoyed meeting and chatting with the manager, lovely people, who are so gracious speaking excellent English. Fully recommend a stay here if visiting the area, just lovely. The restaurant was not open at the time, so am unable to comment on this. There is free secure parking on site, next to pool complex which looks great. Unable use ourselves.","12225":". Rooms are quite noisy \u2013 the doors make a lot of noise when opening and closing, and the noise carries down the hallway. Some WD-40 would help! Beds are a single mattress with no box spring, also creaky, not that comfortable. Morning buffet breakfast is also adequate \u2013 almost all cold items, just a hot breakfast meat but no hot eggs. Nice coffee machine though.  Rooms did have really excellent Wi-Fi. Rooms had rolling shutters to keep out room light from the windows, but the noisy doors (remember them?) didn\u2019t have weather stripping that worked, so a lot of light got in through the door at night.  Elevator was weird, would only stop at a single floor at a time.","12227":"This is a small, boutique type hotel. Clean, fresh, good service. Hotel offers secure parking across the street.  Nice welcome drink. Pool across the street, but nice. They do have a spa but we didn\u2019t have time to use it. Breakfast very nice.","12228":"The Cavour is very close to the Palermo central train station, so it is very convenient. It is on the 5th floor and accessible by elevator. It is family run, and scrupulously clean. It's a nice walk to many of the sights in that very diverse city.","12230":"Tucked away in a quiet street just around the corner from the train station is the little jewel. Perfect location for enjoying all the Palermo has to offer. Teatro Massimo, the amazing market place. The bathroom was clean and the beds comfortable. Would definately stay here again. And it has an elevator! Great Service. Although the lady that runs it does not speak great English she made our stay very welcoming.","12233":"This hotel is very clean, restaurant good where it seems table must be reserved. Staff excellent, nighttime tour of the Temples really lovely, on demand shuttle service to Temples and Agrigento at reasonable price. Breakfast can be variable, if owners are on duty all excellent but if not then items not replenished and tables not cleaned quickly. Pavements from the hotel to beach and centre of San Leone are truly awful.","12236":"I loved the hotel \u2014 clean and comfortable ~  The reception staff was amazing \u2014 very helpful and went over and above with helping me ship my bags etc \u2014 especially Salvatore was a life saver ~  Would stay here again !","12239":"This hotel was a fill in as there was an issue with our original choice. Our agent offered this as an alternative. The hotel is clean and we had 1 of 2 garden villas. They are separate from the main hotel and overlook the pool or the parking area (secured) Its a gated area. The villa has a small kitchenette and sleeps 3-4 comfortably. there is a second level with a 1 person jacuzzi and 2 sunbeds overall very quiet. The hotel is close to the valley of the temples and they offer an evening drive around the site which is great for the next day when you visit. Dinner was okay but the ambience in the restaurant didnt change between dinner and breakfast same lighting same music...","12242":"A really good option for staying in Palermo. The rooms are clean and elegantly furnished. The atmosphere is very friendly and relaxed - you litterally pass through the appartment of the family who is running the albergo on the way to your room. Nice breakfast (served in the room). One of the nicest places I have ever stayed.","12243":"I stayed 2 nights at this property as part of an Odysseys Unlimited tour and was very disappointed. The room I had was very small and you could hear people coughing through the thin door and walls. There is only one small elevator which can only hold about 4 people. The pool is across the road and did not look inviting. Most shocking, however, was the condition of the surrounding streets (dirty and littered with dog feces). The breakfast was good with many choices. But it did not make up for the noisy room and surrounding area.","12246":"Perfect location, just 1 min from central station and 10 min from Old town. Great price and lovely service. Everything was very clean and tidy. I had a room with huge balkony and stunning view. Totally recommend that hotel!","12247":"On top of an art deco building is a nice albergo situated. Here we got a quiet, clean and tasteful room with nice linen and comfortable bed (except the hard pillows) in the center near the railway station. Breakfast came on a brick table and the staff was nice and helpful.","12263":"This hotel was nice, roomy and clean. It has a pool but it is across the street from the hotel as is parking. It had many amenities but communication with the front desk wasn't good because their English was not good. We booked massages and were not given them and the staff couldn't explain in English why another annoying communication problem. We had breakfast that came with the stay and the front desk never told us about it.","12280":"Not quite a 4 stars hotel, maybe between 3 and 4. Rooms are spacious, the restrooms are nicely furnished, very private with a window on your own little porch with chairs (that\u2019s nice). Across the road, awkward and uncomfortable, there is access to free parking and free swimming pool. Swimming pool is nice and risk free but it\u2019s unattended and right in the middle of 4-5 stories building looking down into the pool. Privacy Zero. No food, no drink. Afterwards you have to walk across the road between cars and motorbikes to reach the hotel entrance. Uncomfortable.","12297":"Very limited breakfast to the point that only eat once of 3 days and rude server Bread, ham and cheese only and almost over after 8:30 am. Not recommended at all Overall hotel should be one star only Run down facility","12300":"Albergo Cavour is not your typical hotel. It's located on the 6th floor of an apartment building. Pros: - Great location just a block away from the train station and very close to the major Palermo attractions - Quite - High ceiling - Balcony (tiny) - Typical Italian breakfast, fresh and always promptly brought to your room at the time you request the day before - Unbelievably friendly and warm staff always willing to help and accommodate your needs even before you are aware of them Cons: - Soundproof is almost non-existent - The room length, width and height are all of approximately the same size - The beds were not comfortable: - the pillows were flat and thin - there\u2019s some sort of a plastic mattress cover underneath the sheets (to prevent body fluid leakages?), which makes the already uncomfortable mattress make annoying sounds with your every move However, the friendliness of the staff makes up for all the little deficiencies listed here, and we would happily stay there again if we ever come back to Palermo.","12332":"I happened upon this hotel when walking from the train station, heavy suitcase in tow. After the innkeeper opened the door to the room I was stunned by its size and the extravagant ceiling. I then felt quite embarrassed after I asked to see the room before I agreed to take it. After I checked into the hotel I laid on my bed and spent about twenty minutes staring up to the heavens(the gorgeous ceiling). Besides the ceiling, the hotel is small and quaint and everything is clean and cheerful.......Owner is not overly chatty and leaves you to your own devices. Her husband was helpful though when I needed help making an online booking with edreams website. Very conveniently located and fabulous value for your money.","12351":"My wife and I spent 4 nights staying at Colors B&B in September 2019. Ambra and her parents run the B&B. Ambra welcomed us and speaks good English. She and her Mum and Dad are lovely people. Had lots of chats over an included breakfast with Dad using google translate. He makes great coffee. Right next to a pedestrianised street and their lane turns into a market during the day. Rooms are large with a broad comfortable bed. The en-suite bathroom is very bright with a modern shower. This was all spotlesslyand clean. Tea and coffee making facilities are provided in the room.","12355":"Our four year old was THRILLED to watch the trains out the window of our room. The hotel is literally located on platform five. The room - and entire hotel - was clean, modern and conformable. The staff were friendly and helpful. We really enjoyed our stay.","12370":"I was traveling for work to Palermo and stayed for one night at Colors B&B. The rooms are very nicely furnished, colorful and clean. A mini fridge, kettle and hairdryer are provided in each room. The location is right behind the Teatro Massimo. The attention to details is very high and I loved it. Would recommend!","12409":"I was there for one night only this August! This place it's just great! Lovely people,amazing and clean rooms and also very colorful as Siciliy is! Such a cool place to go. I will come back!  Sono siciliana e andare li,grazie al consiglio di un amico, \u00e8 stato fantastico. Da non perdere. Qualit\u00e0 prezzo perfetti, come tutto. Grazie mille ancora di tutto! M.","12418":"Very hard to find and difficult to get there by car and park. However superbly located in the Capo Quarter. Using this as a base it was easy to explore Palermo on foot. We stayed in the Fuchsia room was was very colourful, nicely decorated and very clean.","12437":"English   Espa\u00f1ol m\u00e1s abajo  Deutsch siehe bitte unten:  During our 10 days Sicilian trip we were living at Agrigento Home Hotel. Before trip start we were wondering if it would be a good idea to state at same hotel at Agrigento train station. Now, we can say it was a great decision!! The hotel was complete renovated one year ago (it was old building part of Train station earlier) and the building is very nice and modern. The rooms are small apartments were we had the opportunity to prepare some short dinner in case we didn't wanted to go outside. The bath was very nice and modern as well. Everything was clean and with room daily service. The personal are top, they take care all the time that we feel comfortable, gave hints for trips, prepare excellent cafe for breakfast (with very good typical Italian buffet). The private parking direct at the hotel which are part of private train station parking, were perfect during our long state. The hotel is located at city centre but also very close to motorway connection to different destination in Sicilia or (as we did) we went to Palermo by train (directly at hotel door). It is really true what other guests complaints about the noise coming fromt train station, however this is the only problem there which we solved very well by using ear xxxxx. With ear tpsxxxx we didn't get the noise early in the morning. We don't like to finish our assessment without to mention that the hotel is also very dog friendly and also with our dog (good educated one) was everything good there. We can really recommend Agrigento Home Hotel!!!  Espa\u00f1ol: Durante nuestro viaje de 10 d\u00edas en Sicilia, nos alojamos en Agrigento. Al principio no est\u00e1bamos seguros de s\u00ed era una buena idea alojarse en el mismo hotel justo en la estaci\u00f3n de trenes en Agrigento. Ahora podemos asegurar que fue una buena decisi\u00f3n. El hotel lo renovaron hace un a\u00f1o y tiene un dise\u00f1o muy moderno y agradable ( un antiguo edificio de la estaci\u00f3n convertido en moderno hotel). Las habitaciones son apartamentos peque\u00f1os donde se puede preparar algo para cenar si no se quede salir fuera. El hotel es muy limpio y con servicio diario de habitaciones. El personal es fant\u00e1stico y se preocupan mucho de que uno se sienta a gusto y tenga todo lo que necesita. El caf\u00e9 y desayuno es muy bueno y el parking privado enfrente de la puerta fue perfecto! ( sin extra costes!!) El hotel est\u00e1 pr\u00e1cticamente en el centro donde hay algunas calles peatonales y tambi\u00e9n muy cerca de la conexiones a otros destinos o (c\u00f3mo hicimos nosotros) se puede tomar el tren a Palermo (justo en la puerta del hotel). Las quejas de otros hu\u00e9spedes con respecto al ruido de la estaci\u00f3n son ciertas pero en nuestro cas\u00f3 resolvimos el problema usando tapones para los o\u00eddos. Con los tapones uno ni se entera de los trenes que llegan o salen temprano. No quiero terminar sin decir que el hotel tambi\u00e9n acepta animales de compa\u00f1\u00eda y que con nuestra perrita ( eso si, muy bien educada) nos sentimos muy bien en Agrigento Home!! Recomendamos este hotel sin ninguna duda!!!  Deutsch: W\u00e4hrend unseren 10 t\u00e4gigen Reise in Sizilien, wohnten wir im Agrigento Home Hotel. Bevor wir dort buchten, waren wir nicht sicher, ob wir tats\u00e4chlich in Agrigento im Hauptbahnhof wohnen sollten. Jetzt k\u00f6nnen wir sagen, es war eine sehr gute Entscheidung. Das Hotel wurde vor einem Jahr komplett neu renoviert und ist sehr sch\u00f6n und modern eingerichtet. Die Zimmer sind kleine Appartements mit einer kleinen Single K\u00fcche, wo man sich etwas kleines kochen kann, wenn man essen gehen m\u00f6chte. Das Bad war sehr sauber und modern eingerichtet. Jeden tag Zimmerservice. Das Fr\u00fchst\u00fccksb\u00fcffet war typisch Italienisch, sehr guten Cafe, leckere Backwaren. Das Personal war sehr nett und gab tipps f\u00fcr Trips. Der private Parkplatz ist kostenfrei und war fuer uns perfekt. Das Hotel ist im Zentrum und man kommt auch sehr schnell mit dem Auto aus Agrigento raus ins Land. Doch man kann auch direkt mit dem Zug nach Palermo fahren, der Bahnhof liegt ja vor der T\u00fcr. Es ist wirklich war, was andere G\u00e4ste schreiben wegen der Lautst\u00e4rke des Zugverkehr am fr\u00fchen morgen. Allerdings l\u00e4sst sich das schnell mit Ohrst\u00f6psel l\u00f6sen. Wir haben sie benutzt und konnten super lange schlafen ohne von Zugbewegungen geweckt zu werden. Wir sind mit Hund gereist und haben mit grosser Freude festgestellt, das dieses Hotel auch Hundefreundlich ist. Wir k\u00f6nnen wirklich das Hotel empfehlen!","12458":"Why to stay in Agrigento per se when visiting the Valley of Temples? Villa Cetta is much closer to the monument, and located right next to miles and miles of beautiful sandy beaches and great restaurants. B&B Villa Cetta is located 5 mins walk from the beach, offering comfortable rooms, great breakfast in the garden, free parking, and friendly, knowledgeable hosts. Marco would not hesitate to go an extra mile to make his guests feel comfortable.","12467":"We stayed at Villa Cetta for three nights and loved everything about it. Marco is a superb host who goes out of his way to help and his suggestions for local restaurants and sight seeing were excellent. The breakfasts are delicious and plentiful and the accommodation is beautiful, clean and very close to the beach. Marco provides everything you need for a pleasant day on the beach. We hope to return and stay longer next time, thank you Marco.","12494":"We spend 6 nights in this cozy B&B. The host is very polite and gives a lot of helpfull tips for restaurants and activities. He speaks english very well which is not common in this part of Sicily. The beach is right across the street and during our stay it was calm and peaceful. Breakfast was extensive including different kinds of pastry and fresh fruits. This B&B was exaclty what we were looking for. Thanks for your good care Marco!","12497":"We spent three days at Marco's lovely villa in late August this year. It was far beyond our deepest expectations ! Everything was clicking form the very first moment starting with Marco carrying our heavy luggage, serving us immediately after arrival wonderful bowl of fresh fruits, giving fantastic tips about the local attractions and restaurants. I do not even mention the fridge full of refreshing drinks (Sicilian wine including !) waiting for us just on the house ! Simply perfect and even for a second we did not have an impression that it is a kind of business transaction like we pay - he earns and after that everyone goes in different directions. We'd love to be back somehow near in future.  Marco keep it going like that !!!  Best from Brussels  Magdalena and Michal","12499":"This is a unique find: a beautiful garden, quiet rooms, superb breakfast, steps from the beach. Only two rooms in this clean and cool B&B whose owner is friendly and attentive, eager to ensure you have a most pleadant stay. A home away from home (all the more that there are only 2 rooms each with seperate terraces, and it is therefore very private. This was the highlight of our hotel choices on our Sicily trip. The charm of the place and the kindness of its owner are still with us.","12514":"A lovely little garden, clean and simple room, close to the beach and a very helpful host who made sure everything was perfect - from the breakfast table to the glass of wine at night! Good Location to visit the Valley of the Temples","12520":"Very good, comfortable and spacious accommodation, excellent breakfast provided by most hospitable host Marco ( who speaks English and fluent French) and has a wealth of local knowledge and advice; former journalist). (Trattoria Caico restaurant v good). The accommodation is 150metres from a long sandy beach (but watch out for mosquitoes). Good WiFi.","12521":"We arrived in the evening and just buzzed the gate and asked if there was any rooms! We\u2019d seen this property on booking.com but decided to go in ourselves rather then book through them.  Upon arrival the host offered to help us to our room with our luggage!  He was a very kind host and allowed us to use the room straight away and gave us fantastic advise on where to eat and visit during our stay.  Parking was quiet and convenient just next to the B&B and we were reassured it was safe to park there during the day and night.  The room was clean, quiet and very well presented and offered a choice of breakfast with us being the only guests for the two nights we stayed.  Located a stone throw away from the beach and you could hear the sea from the garden outside the room! Perfect!!  We would highly recommend to anyone wishing to visit San Leone or Agrigento.","12523":"We extended our stay as we liked the place so much. In a quiet location, convenient for the Valley of the Temples, beach and Scala dei Turchi, this has so much to offer. The room is clean and comfortable, the wi-fi connection good and the breakfast is outstanding - the best we had in Sicily. Marco made us feel completely at home. He guided us to very good restaurants and advised on the best order and time of day to see the sights. His recommendations were most useful and he backed up his advice by providing books and maps. The beautiful garden around the house makes this a real haven.","12529":"After chasing around Sicily to see all the ruins and sites, this is a peaceful,lovely haven for weary travellers. The owner was very welcoming ( even though we got lost en route and were late) . The garden is peaceful and beautiful.....clearly well cared for. The room was modern and well equipped. Breakfast was terrific and my first taste of cactus fruit which was presented beautifully. A memorable stay.","12531":"1.) Beautiful location right next to the dunes 2.) very friendly host 3.) lovely decorated place with a beautiful garden 4.) Great breakfast 5.) Highly recommended If you near Agrigento and looking for a silent place to relax this is more then perfect.","12534":"Villa Cetta is the perfect example of why we favor B&B's as our favorite places to stay on vacation. Our host Marco, was fantastic and we also had the opportunity to chat with another couple staying at the Villa.  Marco put out a great breakfast - the chocolate croissants (my favorite) with coffee was the perfect way to start the day! Marco was also happy to share his favorite dinner spot which we thoroughly enjoyed as well.  The room was clean, and the grounds made the Villa even more delightful. Air conditioning and WiFi both worked well. The location of the Villa is also great - a block away from the beach and a short drive to the Valley of the Temples which was the primary reason for our visit.","12536":"Villa Cetta is exceptional. Marco its owner is a wonderful person, he does everything to make your stay great. The room is perfect, the breakfast fantastic, the recommendations he gave us were perfect, for restaurants, maps, times to go to places, etc. Besides, the BB is located in San Leone, do not stay in Agrigento it is awful to park, plus the city is not appealing. Instead Marco\u2019s place is located one minute from the beach and parking is no problem. You will enjoy his company and the stay, the only bad part is that you need to leave his place. Carla and Saul","12540":"Back to Villa Cetta for the third time in my life. This should be enough to show the greatness of this place. Villa Cetta is a cosy villa that Marco, the host, personalized in a lovely Sicilian-sea place style. Litterally less than 100 meters from the beach, Villa Cetta is the place where to stop if you are in the Agrigento area and want to have a peaceful place to enjoy the surrounding. Beside the beauty of the nature and of the sea, the experience at Villa Cetta is futherly boosted by the kindness of the host, Marco. It's him, with his smile and his welcome attitude that will make the difference. Don't miss breakfast for any reason!","12542":"We really enjoyed our stay at Villa Cetta. Marco is the perfect host. He prepared amazing breakfast every morning and fullfilled all our wishes. Couldn't have been any better. It almost felt like home.  Location is also great. The room was very clean and it had a nice terrace with garden view. More over the Villa is located directly at the free beach.  We would definitely come back!  Franziska & Michelle","12544":"I have travelled many times in the last 20 years and have seldom felt so welcome than in this delightful Villa Marco is the nicest guy and his breakfasts are legendary. Nothing was too much trouble and the beach nearby is stunning, Marco made it special and took great care of us including a free afternoon tea and a bottle of cold white wine thanks buddy!! Stayed here to visit Agrigento and the Valley of the temples, but this is a destination all on its own, it is only rated as one star and thats ridiculous it is an outstanding place and San Leone is a lovely resort","12546":"We decided to stay 3 nights in the Agrigento area for the beaches and the Temple Valley area. The Host of Villa Cetta made them special. We felt warmly wellcome. The place is lovely, well maintained and very clean. The terase and garden are a lovely retreat and you can spend there your free hours reading or jus dreaming. Given a chance we would come back.","12577":"Though my husband has already left his review on this B&B, I feel that he was overly generous in assigning a three rating. I believe if you pay for two nights in a location yet feel compelled to check out the next morning and pay to stay anywhere else, this rates as a terrible location. This is just what we did.  Based on reviews we believed the owner caretaker would be present and available to assist us in navigating Palermo on our first visit. I speak basic conversational Italian, and not very well, so that assistance was a key factor in our booking. When we arrived we were greeted at the door by a woman who cleaned and maintained the property. She spoke not one word of English and I had trouble understanding her ... not a great way to start the trip, but not the fault of the B&B. However, everything that occurred later could have been avoided had the owner been responsive to our attempts to remedy the following:  The locks on the doors stuck. We had great difficulty going in and out of the apartments. Yes, I said apartments. We were traveling as a family of six ... they assigned us in two separate apartments that could only be accessed by going outside one door, walking through a courtyard, and going inside the other. This could have been avoided if we were given access to connecting common areas, but found ourselves locked out after the woman who greeted us left for the day. We didn't know we would be locked out until she was gone. She walked us through these common areas as she showed us around the B&B and to our rooms.  The 4-person apartment is really a fold out couch and two beds divided by a sliding partition. The kitchen is stocked with absolutely nothing. We could not even boil water. The utensils were locked in the main kitchen and we were left with a note saying the kitchen in the apartment was not available to us because we had not requested it. Really?  The air conditioning in both units did not work. The heat was unbearable.  The breakfast in B&B is a joke. They gave us vouchers for the cafe across the street. The coupons didn't even cover the cost of a cappuccino and breakfast pastry.  And worst of all ... regardless of multiple attempts to contact the owner by email to resolve any of these issues (actually we would have been happy to just have a fan in the rooms, truth be told), we never received a response. Once we realized we were not going to get a response from our owner caretaker, we made the decision to leave the next morning. We left to the sound of the woman who had greeted us the day before, yelling and screaming at us in Italian. I understood just enough to know that we were being scolded. In my worst Italian I assured her that the keys and the cash were inside the apartment. She slammed the door in our faces and that was the last impression we got of Ai Cartari B&B.","12613":"We stayed in Marco's Bed & Breakfast for one night on recommendation of other travellers. Little outside of Agrigento close to the beach we found a quiet and charming place. One highlight was the breakfast in the green environment.","12622":"We booked through Laterooms two weeks in advance, received a confirmation. When we arrived we rang the bell, were kept waiting almost 30 minutes and finally the landlady arrived only to be told that the place was overbooked. She gave us some feeble excuse about having had problems with her internet provider and then told us that she had booked us with another B&B nearby. We had no options but to accept. The new B&B was noisy, stuffy and on the whole we did not enjoy our stay there. Cannot comment on the rooms but it is the first time this happens to me and certainly this practice sounds very unprofessional. Had we been notified in advance we would have chosen another type of accommodation. Never again","12631":"Stayed for 3 nights with my wife and found the room very comfortable it is centrally located and and easy walk to most points of interest Gabriel was very helpful unfortunately didn\u2019t get the chance to sample the breakfast but you can hep yourself to coffee and juice at any time","12632":"Run by a group of friendly young people, this bb is in a very central, yet characterful location in between the arabian neighborood, the market ballaro and the hystorical centre. The place is very well run, clean and welcoming.","12637":"My wife and I spent 4 nights in B&B Palazzo Corvino, which is ideally located in the Old Town of Palermo and close to any neighborhood or market anyone wants to visit while in Palermo. It is also very conveniently located very close to the airport bus stop in Via Roma. Rooms are simple but nicely decorated and very clean, with comfortable beds and the B&B is in a quiet street, which allowed us to get a proper rest during the night too. Breakfast is basic however you get the energy required to start the day and the coffee is fantastic. Gabrielle and his cousin Julius really looked after us and made us feel very welcome. Next time we are back in Palermo, we'd love to stay again in Palazzo Corvino.","12645":"From the wide staircases and shared terraces to its spacious rooms and ample bathrooms, B&B Palazzo Corvino exudes comfort and charm.  Everything about it was wonderful and Gabriele was a welcoming and informative host who spent the first 15 minutes of my arrival with a map showing me the best sights and how to navigate my way through them.  It helps that the B&B is right in the heart of the historic Kalsa district of Palermo, far enough from a busy Via Roma to be extremely quiet yet close to facilities such as ATMs, supermarkets (Lidl is around the corner) and the central train and bus stations.The UNESCO world heritage cathedral and Capella Palatino are only 500 metres away. The alleyways that surround the property are dotted with small churches and piazzas bordered by a wide choice of restaurants, both traditional and modern.  While breakfast is officially served from 8:30 onwards if you are an early riser you can make your own espresso and help yourself to (carton) juice, yogurt and biscuits, all of which can be taken outside on the large shared terrace overlooking the internal courtyard of the palazzo.  The only hitch was that my key to the main pedestrian entrance had a tendency to get stuck but Gabriele kindly lent me the key to the car gate as a fullback.","12648":"We stayed for 4 nights in March and the Palazzo Corvino was the perfect place to stay. The host, Gabriele, was extremely attentive and helpful, giving us all the information we needed for sightseeing and eating in the city and all around the area. His rooms are very clean and comfortable and the continental breakfast with fresh pastries and coffee was delicious. When staying at Palazzo Corvino you feel as if you are in the 'real' Palermo with its original 16th century architectural features alongside modern ensuite comforts.From its location you can see the city on foot and the bus and train stations are a 10 minute walk for trips further afield. We used the transport arranged by Gabriele to and from the airport. Matteo, the driver, was very dependable and much more competitively priced than anything we could find on line. Gabriele is a charming host and does everything he can to ensure you have an enjoyable visit to his B and B and to the city of Palermo.","12681":"I was disappointed.We were in a superior Double room,which I thought was quite claustrophobic,when you shut the door.The room went right onto the poolside which seemed to be unfinished,dirty and with bits of wire and plumbing scattered about.There was no excuse to have not tidied up and given it a clean.The loungers were also dirty around the pool. We are vegetarian,and they did try to accommodate us.But the boiled eggs were raw and inedible,and the coffee that was prepared was American(which we do not drink)No decent coffee in the morning! Would I recommend this place-No. I also do not understand how some other people have rated it highly. We won't be back!!","12720":"we stayed 2 nights at Gabrielles b&b. we had a nice and spotless clean room. the bed was comfortable and the room was very quiet, which is great, because you are in the middle of the old town where is a lot of noise. the breakfast was nice and gabrielle is just amazing. he was the perfect tourist information and suggested us very nice places to go. would stay here again.","12727":"I am a senior adult experienced world traveler, picky but not overly so, who does much research before choosing a lodging and so am rarely disappointed. LOCATION: FANTASTIC, center of historic district, clean safe street area, short walk from railway and bus station, just off main street with many buses. near sites, restaurants and not too far from shopping BUILDING: historic palazzo TYPE: one long flight up, in completely modernized renovated apartment w rooms off central lobby and separate breakfast room CLEANLINESS: spotless PERSONNEL HOST: very kind and personable host, perfect english, gives map & every imaginable information on local sites, restaurants, shopping, transport, he is there from 8:30am till about 2pm, but later if needed ROOM: large and cheerful, nice decor BATH: not euro-tiny, good size with all amenities VIEW: historic street from balcony BREAKFAST: usual offerings, satisfactory, with daily home-made pastry feature NOISE: very quiet, inside & from street. no barking dogs, traffic, or night time revelers (an amazing feature in an historic Italian neighborhood!) COMFORT: very comfortable beds PUBLIC COMPUTER WIFI: wifi OK and one can use host's computer SUM-UP: I would never stay anywhere but here in this wonderful place","12754":"Gentle and well educated people, very much culturally informed, helpful and smiling, very good breakfast on a beautiful terrace, home made cakes by Antonella, her husband made me and Michael aware of what was going on in Agrigento, if it had not been for him we would not know about the local organization for city tours led by these very motivated and dedicated young people, proud of their town that they like to share in all its aspects with tourists.  I recommend it strongly, very clean, the wine left in the room by the owners is a little gift that makes you feel very pampered.","12821":"This is a lovely hotel, great value for money, apartments are basic but comfortable. Big fridge, essential in the Sicily heat. All staff very friendly and helpful. Breakfast superb, clean, beautiful sea views, recommended.","12834":"Drove down from Palermo. Beautiful drive overlooking Mediterranean Sea; hotel staff and s super friendly, very well situated , drove everywhere around , Scala dei Turchi, the Temples, the beaches , SAN Leone Restaurants are the finest. Can\u2019t wait to go back.","12844":"I really enjoyed my stay at the Antica Perla. I loved the spaciousness of the property. There was always ample room to park. It has a large reception area with beautiful views out to the swimming pool and the Mediterranean. My room was impeccably clean. It had a good sized balcony with more scenic views. The bed was very comfortable, and the area around the hotel was quiet which made for some peaceful sleeping. The bathroom had a great shower and plenty of towels. A delicious breakfast was served in a bright and comfortable dining room just off the main reception area. There is a well stocked bar with lots of snacks. It was open through the afternoon and evening. There is no restaurant located at the hotel, but there are several good ones located a short drive away. The customer service was excellent! The hotel is family owned and operated and that was evident.The staff were very friendly and knowledgeable and made me feel right at home. Adding to all this, beautiful Cannatello Beach is a short walk away. The Antica Perla was one of my favorite places I stayed at during my adventure around the coast of Sicily.","12853":"There is absolutely nothing wrong with this hotel but unfortunately the surroundings leave a lot to be desired. Restaurants are not particularly close by so a car is a must. We checked out after a few days as we both spend so much time driving we did not want to be doing it everyday on holiday. The sea is beautiful but the detritus you need to wade through to get there is very off putting. Disappointing and lets the environment down. This hotel would benefit from having their own restaurant on site,investing in their own private beach & having a regular shuttle bus to run clients around. Otherwise as other reviewers state the hotel is spotlessly clean&all the staff are great. Beware, you have to hire a car and it is 2 hour drive from Catania aurport. Holidays companies promoting this hotel do not necessarily make this very clear. Sicily is an exquisite place to visit.","12860":"We had 2 rooms both we huge balconies overlooking the pool and Mediterranean Sea. It was a peaceful place to relax after exploring the island. The place has a small bar and snacks. The staff, although their English wasn't advanced, were wonderful and helpful.","12890":"The positives: the service at this hotel is fantastic. They let us check in early, and kept our luggage for us after check-out the next morning at no extra cost. We could see the sea from our balcony. The room was clean. It wasn't too far from the Valley of the Temples. The price was very reasonable, especially considering that it included breakfast, which was excellent. The coffee was strong and rich, there were fresh croissants (still warm!) and other pastries, in addition to hard boiled eggs, meats, cheeses, yogurt, and the typical cereals and fruit juice.  The negatives: The hotel is older and a bit tired and dated. The nearby beach is littered with trash. I was traveling with my daughter and we had a basic double room (queen bed). They converted it to a twin room by separating the mattress, which made the beds very small, and I can't imagine the bed was comfortable as a queen, either, since it was two mattresses pushed together. We had a balcony, but the door didn't lock and it was easily accessible from the neighboring rooms, so it did not feel safe.  It was fine for us for a one night stay. I would not have wanted to stay any longer.","12908":"We arrived at this hotel and were so disgusted by it that we left even though we had paid upfront. How on earth it achieved Four stars is beyond me. The whole place is shambolic. Dirty, scruffy, in desperate need of a complete overhaul. Scruffy, dated, dirty, cheap furnishings. Even down to the finer details like toilet roll, they offer brown recycled crunchy paper, No comforts for a holiday whatsoever. The balcony fitted one person at a time and backed straight onto next doors balconey, so no security there and a sheer drop down with a low protection wall looking over a car park with badly in need of emptying rubbish bins. Plastic tat everywhere for chairs for guests to sit on. No dining restaurants at all and the area could not facilitate this either. The so called beach was just awash with litter, old tyres and flies. See attached photos Believe me, it looks nothing like the photos they have taken to advertise! I do not have a good word to say about this place. When we tried to speak to the owner who was not there when we arrived or left, he refused to even speak to us! We left it to BA to argue our refund which they kindly did. I just hope BA have the sense to remove this place from their list of recommended hotels and save their customers future embarrassment and total disappointment.","12909":"We have stayed in 5 different hotels and B&Bs in Palermo and this is our favorite. Location is excellent and the rooms have a majestic apperance. Our room was quiet and well appointed with adequate place to sit. Breakfast was pleasent but not served until 8 AM. Maybe an issue parking if you have a car. Pack lightly, you'll be carrying your bags on the street and up the stairs but well worth the small inconvenience.","12914":"We stayed in the 2 bed 2 bathroom apartment. It's huge, comfortable, modernised and furnished in a classy mix of modern and classic furniture and decor. Great balcony views up and down the main street of Via Vittorio Emanuele. The apartment is on the top floor so several staircases of varying vintage to climb (no lift) but staff will carry your bags up. Location is very central in the old city, easy walking distance to all the sights.","12915":"This is our second stay at this hotel, we had a two bedroom apartment with a huge balcony overlooking the pool and sea. The Hotel is basic, very clean, and all staff are very friendly and helpful. Would return in a heartbeat. Love this place..","12925":"A big beautiful 2bedroom 2bathroom apartment with modern kitchen and comfortable lounge area... only a year old.Spotlessly clean and only minutes from all the major sights in Palermo.Also a fantastic view from the balconies to the main street below...a pedestrian only area.Anna gave us a warm welcome and Adriano took all our luggage up to the 3rd floor. The kitchen was equipped with the basics for breakfast-orange juice, croissants and good coffee.I would highly recommend this place for those wanting to stay in the historic centre of Palermo.","12927":"I recently had a 2 night stay in 4 Quarti's 2 bedroom apartment with my parents. It's been a highlight for us as the apartment is 5 star. Very spacious, modern and exceptionally well kept. The balcony looks over the main street in the old town and we were fortunate to view the passing parades during a local festival at the time. Location is perfect- a short walk to most sights around the old town and buses only a 15min walk (to Monreale and others outside the main town). It is situated on the third floor (entrance through a side street and not the main hotel entrance) so if you have mobility issues it may be tricky with a few steep flights of stairs however don't let that put you off as Anna the owner was so accommodating and organised help with all our luggage for check in and check out (although we were happy to take the bags back down). There is no breakfast but you do have a fully equipped kitchen and coffee machine (pods, milk provided). There is also aircon for the summer which worked very well. I would certainly recommend this to anyone wanting to stay in a character filled apartment right in the centre of it all. I'll certainly be back.","12951":"We traveled with friends and were enchanted with are long weekend in Palermo. We were right in the center of the old town, location great for walking to sights or jumping on one of the jump on jump off buses right up the street! Breakfast was amazing and all the home baked goodies were sooooooo good! Felt like a home away from home, the decor was nice and rooms clean, shower was great!","13042":"Our family of 4 enjoyed our 2-nights stay at this B&B. It's nothing fancy, as the price suggests, but the room was large, clean, cool (A C), and amazingly quiet - perfect for our needs. The provided an extra bed for each of my kids, and a simple breakfast selection of pastries, yogurt, juice and fruit. There is a small above-ground pool and that my boys (7 and 9) very much enjoyed after a long day at the temples, as well as a beautiful public beach just 3 minutes walk.  One night, the owner hosted a family dinner at the B&B and my boys were invited to eat dessert and play foosball with the owner's children. Everyone was so nice - we enjoyed our stay very much.","13046":"We stayed here for two nights. Our room although spacious, and had a great balcony,the bathroom was up a flight of stone stairs, with no handrail.This was obviously a family apartment, as next to the bathroom, was another bedroom. The bathroom was quite dark, although, everything worked. There was no maid service, so we had to make our own bed, which although is no big deal, it is the first time that this was the case. Admittedly, it was not expensive to stay. The breakfast was minimum. Very poor choice of options. The only parking is on street. It is away from the centre, so we did not have any problem finding somewhere to park.","13119":"Value for money!The room was clean and bright The breakfast were traditional The people were amazing!Very friendly,kind and hospitable We stayed for three nights with a baby 8months !They provided to us whatever we wanted without any cost. Also we forgot one bag and they answered in the mail at 6.30 in the morning and finally the send it to us with a taxi They couldn't be better Thanks for everything Vasiliki-Stathis","13121":"A quirky bed and breakfast location. A good job that we arranged for the hotel to collect us from the airport. Rooms are located on the first floor of anapartment block. Once in the place is very clean and tidy and excellent value for money. It is located in the centre of Palermo so well within walking distance for all of the site. Staff were very friendly and spoke English. If we were going to Palermo again we would definitely book again as it was so well located. Owner is also opening a hotel along the coast next year. We await to hear.","13140":"We stayed there for 8 nights at 547 \u20ac so it is really affordable. Location great near the museums and the shopping streets. Our room had a nice terrace where we could take a glass of cool white wine ( the room has a fridge) in the afternoons. Bathroom clean, breakfast ok and the service really perfect, very friendly and helpful. Thank you all, especially Antoinetta. They have a small reception which was open only in the mornings.","13145":"A bed and breakfast which is basic but clean and well kept. rooms are modern and well equipped. The staff are lovely and are always willing to help . It has a central location, but as other readers have mentioned it is part of business premises and there are only 5 rooms. If you are not using the owner for transport you will need accurate directions to the property especially after dark. It is a little bit noisy on the corridor. Breakfast is basic but will suffice. Just remember you get what you pay for.","13149":"Stayed 2 nights and explored old and new Palermo easily. The B&B is located within a building on the second floor, so don't expect a street sign to help too much. Would be a challenge by car. I came in by share-taxi from the airport (good value). Accommodation is clean and breakfast enough for the walking day. The rooms could do with a kettle & cups, as there is nowhere for a cuppa within the B&B. Staff vary from grumpy to most welcoming, so a little luck required there. Bed in the room was terrible, and a long way from flat. They need to replace at least one bed. Unsure of the other beds. Personal terrace is a nice facility in good weather. Service to the airport by 'grumpy' was very convenient, very fast, and value for money, given the personal door to door service. Ask the day before and it is easily provided.","13170":"This bed and breakfast place is in the heart of the city! Great value for the money, great family, nice staff! Highly recommend! You can reach stazione centrale and the stadium by bus (10-10 minutes), cattedrale on foot (15 minutes through nice markets). Shops (Zara, h&m, etc) 1 minute walk.","13176":"We stayed here for 3 nights and the owner was very friendly. He even picked us up from the airport at 2am for an extra of 25\u20ac. The location is perfect, walking distance to all main attractions and bus to the airport and beach. The only downside is that the doors are not very thick and you can hear everything in the hallway. But otherwise really good B&B.","13213":"Fab location, delightful host, lovely accommodation! Really recommend this b&b! Filippo was so helpful-thank you :) breakfast at the cafe around the corner was really nice too - recommend doing that in the morning!","13216":"Good communication from owner and good directions  Car Park is 5 minute walk so also good - we paid 15\u20ac for 24 hours ( car Park staff not very friendly and they wanted us to leave car keys - we didn't)  The room we got given was very dark and not like photos we had seen, did ask if they had any other rooms available but were told they were all booked - we did see them though as other guests hadn't checked in yet - they were much nicer so my advise would to be request one at front of building not side  Room was clean and shower powerful and hot, lots of towels etc - our view was of an air con unit and water tank. Air con was also not great and quite noisy  Location is great and we felt safe - good pizzeria just outside and staff there were helpful  Breakfast is basically coffee and pastry in bar across the street - thought this was poor  All in all ok but b specific when you request room","13220":"First of all, good luck entering the hotel, Very HEAVY door! Consider yourself lucky to find a staff member at the front desk! Or even at the bar! Room is very dark! If you are a big person or are tall, good luck sitting on the toilet, Your knees will likely be cramped by the glass shower wall. Breakfast minimal. Bed is very comfortable. Nice sheets. Good location,","13251":"This hotel is a typical city hotel. Modern, clean, but very impersonal.\r Parking a bit tricky, and expensive. Valet parking.\r Rooms were modern, but very dark.\r Breakfast good.\r Would have liked a coffee machine in the room.","13263":"The hotel is located near the center of the town of Palermo. Our room was reasonable in size, typical of European hotels. However, it was hard to find enough room for our luggage and other things. There was no desk or chair in our room to work at, or to use a laptop computer. There was no clock radio to use as an alarm in the morning. No matter, we brought our own alarm and did not need to use a laptop.\r \r However, the toilet flushed poorly (others in our group said theirs didn\u2019t work at all). The shower (no bathtub) was modern and roomy, but lacked a place to hang a towel for when we stepped out. And it was very sensitive to others' use of the water elsewhere in the hotel - the temperature varied from too cold to too hot. There was no bar soap - only liquid soap. Bring a washcloth, as they provide none. In the middle of the first night the water was shut down for repairs. When the hot water was turned on in the morning it ran very dirty for several seconds until it cleared. Then it was okay.\r Throughout the first night the temperature in the room was a cold 66 degrees Fahrenheit. The A C would not respond to adjustments from the room, nor could the A C be turned off completely, and the cold air came out of a vent aimed directly at the bed. After requesting a repair the next morning, we were told it had been fixed. Later that day, when we returned to our room, it was a very hot 79 degrees. After our second request for repair, it finally worked as required. The second night was much better. Temperature was fine - and seemed to respond to the room thermostat adjustments. And the shower was much more stable. There\u2019s hope.\r \r The breakfast buffet was good, and had a variety of hot and cold items.\r \r In the evening, when we asked the desk for simple change for a 10 Euro note (for a housekeeping tip), the desk was unable or unwilling to provide it. We were also told that we could not get change at the hotel bar. Not very helpful.\r \r In total, I believe that this hotel could be excellent. The physical location and the basic design of the rooms was very good. However, it has a way to go. All of the things that make for excellent reviews are missing. Others in our group agreed with our assessment. The hotel generally seemed to be unwilling to go the extra mile for its guests.","13264":"I felt compelled to write a review after reading previous reviews. Hotel has been elegantly refurbished. Modern furniture, effective airconditioning, separate shower, not over the bath. Breakfast was excellent, even pastries in warming cabinet & a large range of teas. The central location is perfect for sightseeing. Travelled in Sicily 10 days & the staff in this hotel have been the friendliest & most responsive for service. I highly recommend it.","13266":"We arrived here late Sunday afternoon and were greeted with a warm welcome by the owners.As we can\u2019t speak Italian we used an app on our phone.However we need not have worried as when the younger members of the family arrived they spoke perfect English. Casale di Federico is a beautiful property with a large outdoor swimming pool in immaculate surroundings.There is a lift inside the property to reach the upper rooms for anyone less mobile. The bedroom we stayed in had a nice comfortable bed and the ensuite was spacious and well stocked with toiletries; also a hairdryer attached to the wall for personal use.Off the room was a small balcony. Breakfast was an absolute delight ,beautifully presented with plenty of choice:cold meats,fresh fruit,yoghurts,croissants,cakes,toast,tea,coffee and juices also available to help yourself. There is plenty of parking outside the property. I can highly recommend this property and only wish we could have stayed longer.The owners of this property were extremely helpful and welcoming.","13269":"I visited this past month. The locations was a bit different than I expected -set more in a neighborhood than in a remote area. The pool looked nice but we did not use it. The rooms were very clean and well appointed and the staff very kind and gracious. My only real complaint is that there were too many fragrances used in the cleaning products or in the linens. I aired the room out significantly (also a lovely balcony) but the smell still gave me an awful headache. I would still recommend the bed and breakfast though.","13271":"We had made reservations for three nights but the room was inadequate for me....the ceilings were too low ( I measure 6' 00 ) and the private bathroom was across the front desk. So we asked for another room and they found us a superb one bedroom apartment in the same complex. The staff was very helpful and helped us with the luggages. The concept for the breakfast was also awesome...we were given tickets to a pasterria close to the apartment where we could select our breakfast.","13272":"Small dark basic rooms. The reception area feels modern but the hallways and the rooms are kinda depressing. No Iron board in room and they won't provide you with a one. You have to keep an extra keycard in place to keep the struggling A C working while you are out of the room. Less than average breakfast. The best thing about this hotel is its location, safe area and walking distance to main attractions.","13276":"Excellent location in old town close to teatro Massimo . enough space for 5 in large room (3 small kids).very clean and very friendly hosts that would also help arrange airport transfer. Many excellent restaurants around the corner. Maybe a bit loud on the weekends for light sleepers","13285":"Arrived at the hotel at night .\r The guy on reception was very efficient and friendly\r Room was so hot upon arrival - but it kind of cooled down enough to be able to get to sleep!\r Breakfast was adequate - staff were again very efficient and professional.\r Were able to leave the cases so that we could have a wonder around Palermo - in the heat!\r \r If you are looking for a calm hotel in what appears to be a central area - try this one - you might like it !","13293":"Room was clean, bed nice and firm, pillow too soft. Air conditioning worked intermittently and it was hot in the room when it didn't. Resorted to opening the window for air and then had to contend with the street noise. Staff were grumpy until you spoke in Italian and then they were very helpful. Good location for exploring the city.","13297":"This seems to be a newish hotel; at least the room we had was new and clean and well decorated in a modern style with a beautiful wall paper on the Fountain of Shame. Beds are comfortable and our room was quiet. However, the bath was fitted with an inadequate shower screen that leaks water onto the bathroom floor when showering, which made it very annoying. Breakfast was OK, typical of most Sicilian hotels. Location of hotel is its winning point, Just one block from the shopping thoroughfares of Via Roma and Via Ruggero Settimo and lying parallel to the pedestrian street of via Belmonte, it is very happening in the midst of shops and cafes. Though a word of warning: Palermo shuts down at 8PM; after that it is darkness.","13302":"Hmm. Not great. On my first night I was given a room on the 4th Floor. It was immediately below a 5th Floor kitchen and Breakfast Room. There was noise and conversation up to about 1130PM. And then the following morning the kitchen got going again at about 5AM or so. It was very annoying. Plus, there were various large tour groups staying in the hotel. Not so good if you are not part of one of those groups. A rowdy group of French pensioners had the 'liberte' to drum up noise in the early morning, shouting to each other in the nearby corridor and occupying all the lifts over an extended period while they vacated the hotel. Breakfast, even at 7AM, was a fight to get to the food. Colleagues in other parts of the hotel had a similar experience. I raised my unhappiness about my room with the Front Desk. But I got a frankly sullen response, no apology, no 'we will make this better for you'. After some effort I managed to get a room change. The second night was more peaceful. But the damage was done.","13310":"My room was lovely and the buffet breakfast was very good and plentiful. A Sicilian dinner was also served to our group and was very tasty. They were very accommodating for those of us who are gluten free. A separate gluten free roll was provided with breakfast when requested.","13312":"Our room looked to have been recently renovated (see the photo). It was clean and reasonably well lit. We stayed there on two different days, at the start and end of a tour of Sicily. The hotel was selected by the tour company. The bed was comfortable, the WiFi was adequate for email, and there was not a great deal of street noise. While we did not have time to explore the city, the hotel seems to be centrally located even if the local neighborhood is somewhat drab.\r \r In addition to the room, we had breakfast and supper at the restaurant. Breakfast had reasonable choices and suppers were adequate (we had no choice of menu). The location is several blocks from a main street, but we did find a mall-like setting about a block away that had several attractive places for lunch.","13314":"I had the most incredible time at Villa Maiolica. I felt like family! The BnB is beautiful, perfect, clean, and so close to everything in the area. A perfect stay for an Agrigento visit. I wish I could have stayed longer. And the breakfast. . . truly spectacular. I still think about it. I could not recommend this BnB more and next time I am in the area I will for sure be back. Bravo Lando and Tiziana and grazie mille for everything!","13315":"I was here three nights as part of a tour group. Thee hotel was \u201cadequate\u201d for sleeping. By European standards I suppose it\u2019s a near 5-star place, so you need to remember that hotels overseas are not like those in the US.\r \r The room was clean and about average size that I have had in Italy. The bed was hard as a rock. No iron, coffee pot, and of course no fridge or ice anywhere in the hotel except at the bar if you asked. Breakfast was some hot items like eggs, bacon, carrots, green beans, yogurt, and pastries.\r \r The WI-fi was horrible. I needed to research some activities for the day and would up burning cell phone data and using the phone as a hotspot for the small travel laptop I took.\r \r Like I said, it served a purpose to sleep but that\u2019s about it.","13318":"We had a one night stay at this hotel. Breakfast was good although there was a limited menu. The bed was comfortable and there was plenty of hot water. The hotel is in a very good location for exploring the old town and key buildings.","13322":"Federico is a decent boutique hotel near famous sites such as theaters and shopping area.\r \r Hotel is clean and well-maintained. Thermostat can't be changed; room temperature is too warm.\r \r Shower water temperature is not stable, it changes many times from hot to cold.\r \r Continental breakfast menu is good in the first day. Second day, the local menu selection is limited primarily for tour groups. Like any city in Sicily, Palermo has plenty good food and easy to find.","13330":"The hotel has not much to offer to business guests.\r Poor internet and working possibilities in the room. Our conference room had no windows so no daylight. Breakfast is just enough and no more.The neighbourhood is dirty, garbage on the streets gives a no safe feeling at night.","13344":"Hotel Frederico II is a very affordable, well appointed, and wonderfully located hotel a few steps Via Ruggiero Settimo with well priced fashion shops and one block parallel to Via Principe di Belmonte, a tree-shaded pedestrian street filled with cafes such as Antico Caff\u00e8 Spinnato at #107. The breakfast is only fair, so we went to Spinnato for memorable excellence. Ask for an extra room swipe card to leave in the slot so that the AC can run while you are out so that the room will be cooled off when you return.","13351":"We were on the 'Christmas in Sicily' package organised by Travelsphere for 5 nights. The hotel is well placed in the centre of Palermo with many bars and restaurants close by and also a small supermarket where we were able to buy some fruit. The; hotel has a slightly faded grandeur although it was refurbished only a few years ago. Our double room was spacious with a large double bed and plenty of storage space. Our booking included breakfast and evening meal. Breakfast included fresh fruit as well as the usual cereals and there was a cooked dish of scrambled eggs and bacon described as an American buffet. The bread was very fresh with a toaster and a selection of spreads. The coffee and tea were in urns and were not very hot. There is a small bar area on the ground floor and the coffee wa very good and hot.\r We asked for a room on a high floor as we thought there could be street noise. We were given a room on the 6th floor but were not warned that one of the 2 lifts only went as far as 5. There were 2 further groups in the hotel but by using restaurant space on the 5th as well as the ground floor it never felt overcrowded. Dinner was served Italian style with pasta as a first course which we found very filling and preferred to omit this and enjoy the tasty main and dessert courses. The hotel provided a special Christmas lunch which included fish again in the Italian way. This was a very delicious meal and the fish was beautifully cooked.\r The reception staff were pleasant and helpful but a doorman seemed glum - perhaps because he had to work Christmas Day!","13353":"Very nice. Friendly staff nice rooms and a great location . Didn\u2019t need any transportation as the hotel is in a good place for easy access to the main ares of the city Goog food and drink found within short distance","13358":"It's scrupulously clean and modern. Excellent wifi with fast internet. An adequate continental breakfast. Rooms have mini fridge. And there's a central dining area. We bought heat and eat items at the Carrefour Supermercato and used the microwave. You're blocks from Quattro Canti and other key sights. We'd stay here again.","13372":"Me and my friend stayed at this beautiful B&B for 3 nights to visist Scara dei Turchi and Valle dei Templi . The owner Lando and his sister Tiziana helped us to have such a comfortable and adventurous time in Agrigento. We didn't have a car but could go everywhere we wanted by a tour bus, local bus and bike. Their breakfast was also fantastic - fresh vegetables, salamis, cheeses, and fruits etc... Highly recommend to stay at this lovely oasis!  Naho and Ai from NYC","13395":"You may have a room overlooking the street but, don\u2019t panic, hotel is off the main road and the street is very quiet.\r Staff are pleasant. Small groups stay here. We were booked in by Trailfinders as a couple and were travelling independently.\r It\u2019s what I consider a functional hotel: all the basics, no frills, everything works and is clean. Fabulous shower; beds that are comfortable and breakfast that is more than passable.\r So, all in all a good choice and I would stay here again.","13415":"We stayed in the Hotel Federico II, central Palace\r Excellent location with lots of nice restaurants and cafes nearby as well as the main shopping area. But the hotel is a corporate hotel not designed for tourists. No cafe,\r It was air conditioned but it didn\u2019t work well and as the temperature outside was souring inside the roo. With the setting on 18 degrees the temperature was closer to 28 and not comfortable for sleeping. Breakfast was acceptable and the staff were pleasant. The front desk staff were completely hopeless, with one exception, and the answer to any question was generally I don\u2019t know. The trip was organised by Citrus Travel, which we would never recommend and the wrong choice for tourists.","13423":"Very clean, basic and simple. On a quiet street close to shopping. Carpet on the room floor was smelly, old smell of cigarettes and dirt. You have to pay 25 euros extra per person to use the sauna and other facilities.","13433":"Quiet hotel and well located on side street. Agree with other reviews that it was kind of dark, hard mattress and pillows, reserved staff. Breakfast was typical but decent. Appreciated that they had a large pot of American coffee!","13441":"I stayed here for 2 nights and really enjoy the accommodations, decor, and how central the hotel is to the city. We could walk everywhere and all the shops and restaurants are close. The staff is friendly and the hotel is quaint.","13463":"A fantastic location and a great value! Armando and Beverly could not have been more helpful. Armando guided us to a convenient parking lot. Don\u2019t miss the Teatro Massimo and the regional museum with unbelievable artifacts from Selinunte, both right there.","13464":"This was an ideal place stay when looking to explore Palermo and provinces surrounding it. The staff were very helpful and the owner Armando went out of his way to ensure he was always available to answer any questions. He recommended some excellent restaurants and tourist attractions. We wouldn\u2019t hesitate to book again!","13481":"The hosts are very nice and our suite was large and comfortably appointed. But the renovations disturbed our stay. Palermo was our last stop after several weeks of cycling and walking. I selected the property because it had a balcony with a view. Armando (the host) contacted me shortly after I booked to let me know exterior work was underway on the building and that the balconies were shrouded. I expressed concern but he said other guests had not found the work intrusive and that the work might even be finished by the time we arrived. Armando\u2019s statement was supported in the various reviews I read. By an unfortunate quirk of timing we arrived as work commenced on the exterior right near our windows and balconies. Our plan in Palermo - after a hectic few weeks - was to sleep in each day, do a bit of shopping or sight seeing, have lunch then a long afternoon siesta. Didn\u2019t happen. At 7.00am each morning we woke to workman walking past our windows on the scaffolding encasing our balconies. The work; cement rendering, banging and grinding, basically continued all day each day. In many respects it was just poor timing. We don\u2019t normally spend much time in our hotel room and are normally up and out early. But we had planned a relaxing time in Palermo hence the booking of a suite. It was very disappointing. The B&B is very well located and lovely. I\u2019d certainly stay here again but I\u2019d want to be assured that the renovations were complete or at least not as disruptive as they were during our stay.","13483":"We had a lovely stay at Porta Maqueda B&B. The central location was perfect for us as it was our first visit to Palermo. Armando and Stella were extremely gracious and helpful with information, dinner reservations and so forth. Although it is on a busy street the two sets of doors to the patio made it really quiet for sleeping. All in all a good experience, highly recommended. Grazie mille Porta Maqueda B&B!","13493":"Quaint new B&B in Palermo, right in the centre opposite Teatro Massimo our room faced Teatro Massimo. Great places to eat close to B&B and can stroll the streets outside until late at night. We had a car and you can park on the street right outside the door at minimal cost. Armando the host was great always greeted you with a smile and ready to help. Breakfast was ample with lots of choice eggs, croissants, cereal fruit and great coffee. Room was very clean and comfortable would definitely stay here again. Grazie Armando, Prosperina :slightly_smiling_face:","13499":"This B&B is very well located in central Palermo. Parking in the surroundings is easy. The rooms are big, confortable and well equiped. Its hosts are really kind and will give good advise on what to see and where to eat. Reccomended.","13513":"We were six releatives visiting Palermo and we all stayed there-The location is excellent -in the old city center which makes it very easy for sight seeing ,the bus stop which takes you to the beach was very close,since we didn\u2019t have a car. The rooms were comfortable and clean , the breakfast was delicious and on top of all many thanks to the host Paolo who treated as family and made this Bed & Breakfast our little home in Palermo!!!!!","13526":"First they took money from my card without waiting for me even though I called him the day before a couple of times to ensure that the room was booked and when I called I was told not to worry and he was in a hurry because he was having dinner. When I arrived at the B&B I found the room not very clean. The shower was not the best and the shower gel was put into a old broken plastic bottle. Bedsheets were not clean and mattress topper were full of hair. When I called the guy and I showed him of these he said what do you expect from a B&B?. I asked him to change my bedsheets and mattress topper and he asked me for help because he needed to go to the reception. Am I paying and doing my own bed whilst I am on holiday ? The shocking thing is that he went into my privacy. I forgot the pack of lady pads and he took it and said don't you put this in the toilette I was so embarrassed! When I went for the breakfast I requested for a second croissant and he said I don't have more because you have eaten all. I will never ever again return to this place! Spend your money somewhere else. There are better places than this and cost less!","13564":"We stayed here for just 1 night to we didn't get a chance to really check the place properly. The owner was courteous and answered most of our questions.  The B&B is located in the center of the city, close to most attractions. However the street in which it is located is pretty dirty and desolate at night. Additionally the building in which the B&B is located appears to be very old and in need of repairs maintenance. The rooms are sufficient without being special in any way.","13569":"Good position but medium quality of services and doubtful clearness with some ...disgusting domestic insects... Breakfast sufficient but coffee not according to Italian tradition! Parking: Free on the street in the front of the house. Note: Only cash paying... I would not recommend this B&B.","13613":"This is a budget B & B but it is immaculately clean and in a very convenient position for train and coach and city tram.There is no reception as such but access is by pre-booking. You will then receive a code for the outer door and the key safe. All straightforward and simple. There are two flights of narrow stairs to climb so a heavy case can be a little difficult. Breakfast at 5 Euros was outstanding. A continental breakfast but varied and plentiful. Highly commended","13614":"Great location, 2 mins to trains & airport shuttle and walking distance to city centre and must-see sights. Comfortable & fresh rooms. It offers good entry security and there's also a safe provided in the room. Good facilities all round. Very helpful & pleasanr hosting.","13627":"very good location next to central station. Free parking in street. Clean and large room (suite), large bed was good, small bed too hard, bathroom big and cool colorful lightning very good wifi breakfast was good, maybe brown bred could be added instruction for key pick up was very good, add that room door inside opens with key card and not keys. friendly and helpful owners staff","13642":"A really great B & B in a great location, near to all the buses and trains but in a quiet street. The rooms are very clean and quite large and are decorated in an almost boutique style. Breakfast is buffet and has a choice of both sweet and savoury. There is also hot water in the breakfast room so that guests can enjoy a tea or coffee during the day. Francesca and Simona are very friendly and helpful and guests can also make use of the computer.","13644":"Very clean, very well organized for late check-in. Next to tram, train station, easy walk to open air market ...a must to see and smell food , fish etc. You will not be dissappointed, note : no elevator to second floor. Very clean. Choice of eggs and omelet was pleasant.","13721":"We stayed just one day to visit the Valley of the Temples. Flaminia, the owner, was really hospitable and discreet. We were 4, with our 2 children, but the room was big enough to feel comfortable. Everything very clean and tidy. The sea view from our veranda was very nice. The breakfast was rich and of excellent quality. Home made jam and cake with fruits from Flaminia's garden. The only problem was the sound of the passing vehicles from the main road. For a light sleeper, like me, during summertime, when traffic is probably heavier, I guess that the traffic noise might be a bit disturbing.","13749":"I spent 2 nights at the lovely b&b where we have been amazingly treated by Andrea that offered all the needed touristic information by Andrea and he spoiled us buying typical cannoli for breakfast. The room as spacious, clean and available of all sort of facilities: fridge, a c, big wardrobe and an amazing decorated ceiling. The flat is beautiful. Andrea is a lovely host. The toilet is outside the room but each room has its one. Great thing!","13767":"We stayed here for a night visiting Valley of Temples and it was really close by, so location is perfect. When you arrive it does not show much form outside, but the rooms itself are nicely renovated.  Parking can be done on the street before entering the narrow dead-end street to the property itself.  The only not-so-ideal thing is, that you will be sharing the kitchen with other people and since you will be in room behind a regular door, things might get noisy in the morning if you are not the first one to get up.  Good enough for 1 night.","13818":"I stayed at Casa Mo for 8 days and I'm already plotting on coming back next year! Place is absolutely lovely, situated walking distance from Politeama. Located in 19th century palazzo, lovingly restored and now being runned by couple of charming owners. Disagree with the comment about breakfast below- I found it sufficient and Andreea's coffee (cappucino) is to die for :)  Hoping to return in 2014 with my family, couldn't wish for more and simply cannot recommend it enough.","13839":"Me and my wife spent 4 nights at this BB. Do not judge it by the outside, inside is a real surprise, high ceilings with old original paintings. The room was so clean with TV and good air condition. The owner is a young friendly couple who speak English well enough. They were so kind to us, although we broke a vase by accident they were always smiling didn't let us to replace it! BB is located next to the port and 10 min walk from major city sightings.","13843":"Had read about the beach being over crowded and dirty and buses full. We were lucky enough to get a lovely day late season and mid week so crowds were down. The beach was spotless and the water crystal clear.... one of the best beaches we have been to. Highly recommend especially the Palermo end of the beach. The bus was still pretty full but at least they are regular.","13844":"I still have an ear worm from the continuous whining of beach sellers. IT'S sandy, all the way from promenade to the warm aquamarine sea. It is littered with bits of plastic, cigarette ends and the occasional discarded beer bottle. You wont be left alone to relax, somebody will stand next to you evrey 10 minutes asking you to buy trinkets, drinks, very nice double bed sized' throws' or a massage (the only happy ending available is when the sun goes and so do they) There is a great place to round off your days tanning, The 'Touring Caf\u00e9 Beach' on Viale Regina Elena Excellent food Nicely Priced and enhanced by pleasant service. Get a Bus Or","13847":"We took a taxi from Palermo to Mondello beach for the day. Loved it! We had perfect weather and rented 2 chairs and an umbrella for $15. It was crowded, but the people were equally spaced out. The water was warm and crystal clear. There was a stand with food drinks, beer was $2 and you can drink on the beach! I would have liked to spend the night around Mondello beach to get 2 full days of the beach.","13848":"You can reach the beach by bus or train from the city center as well as by car. There si beach service everywhere with moderate prices. Basic service without umbrellas cost \u20ac5 per day per person, an umbrella place approximately 15. The water is mostly clear. In the high season reservation is absolutely necessary.","13849":"We arrived in Palermo and headed straight to the Piaggia. The well-organized beach with adequate chairs and umbrellas made the day on the riviera a dream. The water was so clear and fresh and the scenery of a packed beach with colorful umbrellas made my trip worth it. A must with a gelato on departure.","13856":"After reading reviews I almost did not go. People seemed to love it or hate it. Well it is ok. The water was green, murky, dirty and smelly. The beach is beautiful although very busy. If you go to the very end it is less so. If not for the beautiful view of the cliffs I would have given it a 1 star but if you can get in the green water and swim out away from the crowds and look around it\u2019s quite peaceful and beautiful. I don\u2019t know what the government was thinking letting all the beach clubs set up there. It really ruins what could be a beautiful beach, they also let someone build a monstrosity out into the water. It is a water park kind of thing. It blocks the view of the cliffs and sticks out like a sore thumb. I\u2019m glad I saw it but I would never go again, Cefal\u00f9 is a much nicer place to go as is Taormina.","13858":"We visited this beach with our nine year old daughter in July. We had a driver take us there for about 25\u20ac which was well worth it as public transportation can be long, crowded and hot. We opted to pay for the chairs and umbrellas but there are areas that are public in which you can find a spot to sit. It is expensive to rent the chairs and umbrellas. It is a very scenic beach with lovely views of mountains around it. The water was a perfect temperature and it was shallow and calm for a long way out into the sea. It is a good beach for young children. Our daughter would have wanted more waves!! We spent about three hours there and it was a perfect break and way to cool down from the stifling July Palermo heat. There is a good cafe across the street that has sandwhiches and good gelato. We went around 11:30 am and stayed until 3:30 on a weekeday and it was perfect. It took our driver about 25 minutes to drive us there. Recommended.","13862":"We were there in June. We got the bus from Parlemo which is about a 20 minute journey. The water is beautiful and so lovely to swim. The soft sands are great to lie on. Be prepared for lots of people near to you. There are many cordoned off private bedded areas which cost. We opted for the sandy beach to lie on. It was fine but we were subject to people playing music and up close to us. TOP TIP: On your return to Palermo from beach, don't catch the bus from the Mondello ticket sales as it does a loop from the beach (and the bus is packed by the time it reaches Mondello ticket sales stop). We nearly didn't get on which would have resulted in us missing our flight. We loved it. The waters are crystal clear and perfect for any kinds of swimmers.","13866":"Awesome place with fantastic fish restaurants. But the beach is crazy! We didn\u2019t manage to get a bed at all as they had been pre booked. There is minimum space for public people that don\u2019t use the private spots on the beach. It is so busy your practically on top of each other. It doesn\u2019t make for a relaxing beach experience at all. So get down to the beach early and book your beds for the duration of your stay.","13867":"The water was clean and clear, clean sand, plenty of nearby cafes and sn ask bars, and some street food. Nearest beach to Palermo, about 20-25 mins normal traffic by taxi ~ \u20ac35-\u20ac40. Family of four using 2 umbrellas and 4 beds is \u20ac44 day. Toilets are clean and changing rooms. Bar area with music etc. Best to book. We arrived on a Sunday and it was full but we managed to talk our way in with some persistent talking.","13931":"this b&b was the perfect choice for our stay in Agrigento. We stayed in the room with terrace overlooking the sea, simply amazing! We had free wifi and the room was so spacious, with aircon and lovely interiors.Very clean too! Angela was super nice and available, ready to answer any questions. There is a very handy fridge available for use, we used it for fruit and water. Parking was easy to find too, and free. We were travelling with our baby boy and he loved the cot provided. The valle dei templi was easy to reach and simply breathtaking. We also suggest the stunning Scala dei Turchi beach. All in all definitely recommended!","13935":"My stay at Porta Nuova was pleasantly nice and comfortable. It's in a great location close by Porta Nuova leading to Palermo's historical and architecturally beautiful sites. As a female solo traveller, I found the B&B and its surrounding safe. Marco, the host is very nice and very knowledgeable about the city and around. He is quite a source of good information--places to eat at or to visit. I am very satisfied and happy to have stayed at Porta Nuova.","13936":"Our adventures in Sicily began when our plane's arrival in Catania had been delayed. After getting our rental car we drove 2 hours from Catania to Agrigento in the dark. It took sometime to find the B&B we had booked, which was inexplicably and unfortunately closed when we arrived. A very kind father and son came to our rescue, offering to call a friend who owns B&B Anita to see if they had a room. The owners came late at night to accommodate our needs, giving us a key, and asking us what time we'd like breakfast. By then we were dismayed and worried our 2 week trip to Sicily was jinxed!  But a good night's sleep was rewarded by opening the shutters to a stunning view of the Mediterranean Sea....we knew then we were exactly where we were supposed to be! Angela, the manager house keeper provided a delightful breakfast of freshly baked pastries and cappuccinos. Angela, who speaks English, spent time helping us design our visit to this lovely and interesting part of Sicily. She allowed us use of a marvelous terrace in the rooms next door which offered a breath-taking view while we sat and drank a bottle of superb Sicilian wine. Although we only stayed at B&B Anita 2 nights, Angela was one of the many gracious and friendly people we got to know in Sicily.  B&B Anita is for anyone wanting an authentic Sicilian experience. It is located on a safe street near shops and restaurants, with even a fruit vendor selling fresh produce at good prices close by. Our room was 50 Euro, perhaps a little pricy compared to a small hotel we subsequently stayed in. But for charm and location it was worth it.We fell in love with Sicily and Agrigento at the B&B Anita!","13982":"Very cheep and nice b&b. Excelent service. Rooms clean every day and new towels. Quiet location but CLOSE to all facilities and tourists areas. Very helpful owner - Marco and speaks English. Really nice place.  Michael- Ireland","14006":"The location is amazing. It\u2019s a comfortable place with very clean, and spacious rooms. We reached early in the morning and were allowed to leave our bags there. The breakfast was simple but sufficient too. It would be good to provide Tea  coffee tray in the rooms (as they promise), or at least in an open central place. After 3 pm, there\u2019s no one around for anything. Also, a safe in the room, and some extra sockets for charging.","14017":"Rooms are a bit dated, but good size bathroom. Excellent location to visit valley of the temples and a good few restaurants nearby. We were located right near the lifts and the walls were pretty thin, not a great night\u2019s sleep. However, hotel staff very friendly and a great recommendation for dinner by the reception. Reasonably priced and swimming pool looked good, although no time to test.","14020":"Very good quality for price. As a group we were invited for a welcome drink before dinner. Hotel has good kitchen for dinners that are served by tables and also very varied breakfast (self-service). Rooms are quite big, clean and bathrooms renovated. Overall a good hotel, that I like returning to.","14042":"beautiful hotel, very classy and clean. big pool where we had a good time, staff were terrific and very helpful, wonderful breakfast with many good italian desserts, rooms were very spacious and great air conditioning","14050":"This is a very pretty hotel that is clean, has good food, and is comfortable. The rooms are large. The restaurant has a good breakfast and good dinner for tour groups. The bathrooms look very nice but our toilet button was difficult to flush taking up to 12 presses to activate. Our shower head suffered plastic fatigue and snapped off at the hose. Other members of our group had little hot water during a shower. The Internet was a weak slow signal. The pool was closed. We had a very nice overnight stay but the plumbing infrastructure needs improvement. There are a lidl grocery store and an electronics store adjacent. Good place for tour overnight stops.","14063":"We spent one night stay here during a Globus Tour of the Valley of the Temples nearby. The room was clean and quiet but bed was a bit firm. The included hotel dinner was very good...large antipasto plate, soup, chicken and vegetables as well as dessert. Good buffet breakfast.","14073":"I was part of a tour group and traveling alone. The size of the room was bigger than others I had in other parts of Italy. Very clean, comfortable beds, large washroom, great pool, fantastic food in the restaurant. Exceptional service from the reception desk, cleaning staff and restaurant dining room area personnel. Salvatore and Angelo from the dining area were fantastic. They always greeted our group with a smile and were very helpful. I wasn't able to find anything negative with this hotel. Many thanks to everyone.. Grazie a tutti","14159":"We stayed here for our honeymoon. The hotel room was really nicely designed and very comfortable, and the location was fantastic. The owner was very helpful and had a lot of suggestions and recommendations.","14160":"Me and my girlfriend stayed there for just a night but we both loved it. The position is what we liked the most, as the b&b is in the very center of the city, and basically everything we wanted to see was reachable by foot. The room was fine as well, and also very clean.","14162":"Very surprising high class rooms in the heart of Palermo. The room was very clean and fresh. It actually looked so new and clean that we were wondering if we were the first guests using the room. Perfect location, nice staff and no traffic noise. We will highly consider a new stay next time we go to Palermo.","14163":"Quite and clean rooms.  Very important, that personal and owner are were very supportive and respecfull Hotel is located in the center street of Palermo and very quite in the rooms.  The best choose in central part of Palermo.  Also, I want to say great thank you to manager for help, that he can provide to our family with healthcare issue!","14164":"Beautiful stylish apartment with balcony terrace, superclean, comfy beds, lovely bathroom. Well equipped. Very central, though very quiet location. Absolutely recommendable. Big plus: garage in the same building. Simone is a darling! All major sights and lots of good restaurants in walking distance. No need to come by car, but if you have one, just leave it safely in the garage. Shoud we ever go again to Palermo, this would definitely be our first choice.  Just one comment: we were travelling with a friend in a wheelchair. One of the apartments was advertised as wheelchair-adapted (I had even called for details before booking), which is not completely true. Although Simone and the manager did their best to arrange things accordingly to make the stay enjoyable for our friend, it is not recommended for handicapped guests (shower not accessible, not enough space in the bedroom, terrace not accessible if in a wheelchair).","14165":"Very nice boutique style hotel in the shopping district, walk, shop, eat in this fun part of Palermo. Close to Hop on Hop off which will give you a glimpse into this city of the ages. The management goes the extra mile to ensure your happy with your stay, parking in the building for your car.","14231":"Very nice people, very modern and clean room.\r Breakfast is excellent as the owner prepares by her own typical Sicilia pasticceria . travel book to organize your journey available in the breakfast room.\r A place to choose without any doubt . Close to the temple valley and Scala dei turchi.","14249":"It is a very nice and central location in town, very true to the reviews and published photos. But if you are driving and want to get close to drop-off your luggage, call them for directions, GPS took us around in circles. The B&B is on a one way street not well recognized by the GPS system and to way to arrive takes you driving all around the center of the city. The Palazzo itself and the rooms are old but very charming and clean. Nice old Italian furniture as well, Belle epoque like. The staff was really pleasant and friendly. But we had some real issues as well.\r We had a really bad leak in the shower with water leaking all over the place up to the hall. Since we arrived late and there is no reception in the building there was no one to turn to. We reported next morning and were told that they were aware of it and someone is coming to fix. It would be nice to inform us when we arrived and perhaps give us some additional towels or rags to stop the water somehow. Also they serve breakfast around 9 AM, which is a bit late for travelers who want to have an early start in the Valley of the Temples. Since we were leaving earlier than 9 AM we had eat in cafeteria on the square.","14251":"The location of this hotel is within walking distance to the theater and fabulous shopping district of Palermo. You can't beat the price given the close proximity to all the fun activites of the city. The best part is the service of the staff. They were ready, willing and eager to assist us with every question we had, gave great suggestions as to what to do and see and best of all, they speak perfect English! I was very concerned about not being able to have help entering the building after 3pm but it was actually very easy, You call a phone number, tell them who you are and they buzz you right into the front door and then into your room where the keys are waiting for you. My only reasons for not giving a 5-star rating are 1) our room was directly across from the reception desk and it could be a bit loud in the morning and 2) our shower was very slippery.You have to be very careful and it is a bit concerning. But, we put down a towel and all was well again. I highly recommend this hotel and would not hesitate to stay again.","14255":"Liberty Suites was a great stay in downtown Palermo. Beautiful, spacious suites with generous living space high ceilings and a large bathroom. A great alternative to a formal hotel\u2014multiple suites in the top floor of a vintage building. All kept very clean and nice.  The location is great for access for waking in the heart of the city\u2014historic sites, restaurants, shopping or just enjoying walking the streets.  The staff was so welcoming, kind and gracious. We were thoroughly impressed. Breakfast included in the mornings with a generous spread of pastries, meats cheeses, breads, etc. for you before embarking on the day\u2019s activities.  Much thanks for taking such good care of us on our first trip to Sicilia.","14256":"We stayed here in August for 3 nights, i got a phone call when i landed to see how long i would be.  Found the liberty suites after walking around for a few minutes, they are a bit hidden but didnt mind that.  Went to check in out room would be ready in 10 minutes which was perfect.  Room very spacious, air con, big bathroom. And a very reasonably priced mini bar.  The receptionist was a gentleman couldnt do enough if we had any questions he done hes very best to answer them.  Breakfast plain and simple, breads, cheese meats, yogurts.  Very close to teatro massimo where all the restaurants and bars are. We tried to look online before we went and while we were there to see where tourists went for food and drinks and could find nothing.  So head to teatro massimo and its all there.  Would 100% recommended the liberty suites.","14265":"Super nice and friendly owners and staff, helped us in very practical way to plan our stay in the city. Rooms are very clean and spacious, with all amenities in great state. Breakfast is modest but absolutely delicious and sufficient!! Not to mention that B&B is in a heart of the tourist part of the city, couple of blocks away from the biggest noise but barely 5 min walk from shops, restaurants and all you need to see in Palermo. If you are lazy, we can highly recommend dining and the restaurants downstairs - great service and delicious food!","14266":"Libertysuites was fantastic. Jack greeted us late on sunday evening and could not have been more helpful and friendly. He helped us with directions and with recommendations for lunch and supper. The room was very comfortable with balcony and ensuite shower. Lovely continental breakfast every morning in dining room next to our room. Very quite and peaceful. Lovely lift! Would definitely recommend it to others and would stay there again. Thank you to all the lovely staff who were all so friendly and helpful.","14269":"I was looking for a BAnd B in the area of the port as my connecting ferry from Pazollo was not for 3days, I found Liberty suites booked, to start my ferry was 4 hours late and I had no way of contacting to let them know, but some one stayed till 1in the morning to to help with directions and booking in, my room was very comfortable with a nice little ensuite, in the morning I meet the rest of the staff and they all could not do enough for you, the friendly nature of the staff is second to none, so helpful, nothing was to much for them. If you need a base to explore the island them this is a must place to stay. Thankyou o all the staff that helped in making my short stay a pleasure.","14273":"I made my reservation on booking.com and it was advertised as suites , hence the name of the property . Unfortunately I was merely faced with a room which had an open entrance from the room to the bathroom (no door on bathroom). Even if i was staying with a partner, neither of us would be allowed any privacy to use toilet or shower. Secondly , the view was non existent despite having a lack lustre balcony to boot! The accommodation was based on a lovely street where a couple of nice restaurants were directly in front of the entrance door. The property was on the 3rd floor by old fashioned lift (made of wood and glass and metal). Something like 1950's if not earlier. The reception is only open from 8am to 1pm. The breakfast had no hot food options. The 2 guys who mostly worked there in the limited time Jacamo and Davide didn't know what English Breakfast tea is. I was served black tea with no milk . The coffee was lovely, as was the cheese and ham and bread and bits to use as mere take away options. The bed was extremely comfortable and it was quiet and peaceful accomodation. Despite the 4 rooms available being so called fully occupied I only saw a couple of guests briefly over my 7 days duration stay. The cleaner never changed my bedding the whole time but did replace towels and clean up etc. The shelf in the bathroom was broken and the cleaner knew it was but it never got sorted! There was no space to put toiletries therefore in the bathroom . Gabriel was very helpful and assisted me well with getting a taxi as well as restaurant options and advice in general. I feel \u20ac508 for 1 week includ taxes was a little high since I felt it wasn't exactly a suite but a studio room. It lacks ambiance and is more 3 star quality. Mini bar prices a little high but convenient. No safe deposit box in room which was highly annoying!!","14288":"The lodge of the B&B Camelot, allows the traveler to dive back in time in a post-modern Middle Ages, going up the stairs you arrive in a fairytale environment, the rooms furnished with fine furniture, are included with every modern comfort. The comfortable rooms are crowned by a large terrace that overlooks the rooftops of Palermo, not far from the Cathedral and the new Porta allow visitors to be fascinated by what is the magnificent city of Palermo.","14322":"We had one of the best rooms in the hotel. (They all seem to be different: very large, standard, with mezzanine sleeping area, etc.) Our room (Desiderio) had a chaise longue single bed in the entrance hall, a very large bathroom with a 6' x 4' walk-in shower, a very large double bedroom with balcony, tv, tea coffee & kettle and another chaise longue single bed. (Mattress was comfortable, could do with better pillows, but they were ok.)  The balcony was onto Via Etnea (a main shopping street), so there was some road noise, but there was also a view up the street of Etna and the Villa Bellini Garden (a park) was directly across the road.  There were lots of shops, restaurants, wine bars and pasticceria on the street in the area.  The hotel organised minibus transfers for us and the arrangements worked smoothly.  Points to note: There are no lifts. Reception is on the first floor and the rooms are on the 2nd and 3rd floors. The breakfast room is on the 2nd floor.","14324":"This is the 4th year staying at Etnea Suite so far, we were never disappointed it is in a central position, very close to market and good restaurants. Rooms are always very clean and staff very helpful and friendly. Wifi works properly and most rooms have balcony\u2019s. I would only suggest that maybe i lift will be installed Alfredo :wink: the stairs are too much sometimes :wink:apart from that keep it up guys :thumbsup:","14325":"The location was perfectly, just opposite the Belini Gardens of Catania. Via Etnea where the hotel is, suggested for shopping. The hotel was ok, spacious rooms and clean. I would like to recommend slippers and bathrobes for the room. Also some more hot dishes for the breakfast.","14345":"We arrived and were met by an associate. She was pleasant at first but then demanded my credit card for security. I had booked and pre-paid in advance through my rewards company. They never mentioned any credit card holds. I was handed a lease to sign which was also news to me, because usually you are sent all of this in advance. Then she lectured about smoking inside, we do not smoke. She then said that I had only listed one person when I booked online so I had to pay another 40 Euros for my friend. This was a two-bedroom that was booked so that was ridiculous. I wanted to have my husband check but since we were in another country we decided in the morning to just pay it. Then the hounding began. We were out most days, when I said to her, she said I know? A little strange, how unprofessional. When my friend who was ill met with her to pay she wanted another 10 Euros since she had miscalculated the amount. Of course my friend told her no and to get out. As far as touches, no wineglasses, 3 waterglasses, no dishwasher. The small balcony does not even have a single chair on it. The bathroom looks very modern but nowhere to put your toiletries, only on the shower floor and barely room around the sink. Before I left I requested the Company Presidents name and they would only give it to me if I said why, which I did not. Since I have not had time to research for the name, I am going with this review. We stayed on Via Etna and loved Catania if not for this bizarre experience.","14359":"Lovely stopover before moving to Regusa.very friendly staff.great location.breakfast plentiful.no problems at all.this is out second year to stay here.so handy to get to bus station to move around Sicily.","14363":"Charming little hotel with a perfect location! Around the corner you can find excellent restaurants, fish market, historical places and the lovely Bellini garden. Rooms are wide with a balcony, and they get cleaned every day. Service is good and the breakfast is awesome with lovely sortiment of local pastries and stuff. Bonus + is the airport Alibus which stops in front of the hotel with a cost of 4 euros.","14391":"Centrally located Reasonable priced Parking available but have to pay Spacious rooms Good size bed Clean However toilets needs some repairs especially toilet which is woobly Air conditioning temperamental Tv no English channels at all Continental breakfast - mostly tinned food","14394":"Really great location with fantastic staff who upon arrival gave a great overview of what to do in Catania. The bed was one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in and overall the Etna suite deserves 5 stars!!","14397":"I stayed at this Lovely newly renovated B&B with my wife few weeks ago for a night so we can visit the temples and the city by night. The rooms were all brand new and very clean. The Breakfast was delicious and was served at the terrace with a great view of the temples and the sea. It is not very far from the temples and a very short walk to city. I really recommend this place if you want to visit the historic city of Agrigento. The owner was really kind and helpful and told us all we had to do and where to go.","14402":"Excellent location with the benefit of private parking. I booked the best room available for a treat. Room has jacuzzi bath which although looked lovely, we didn\u2019t use. The problem was that the motor under the bath made a noise throughout the whole night which was disturbing. Beds were very comfortable, service at reception and breakfast were excellent. I would return but not to the jacuzzi suite.","14404":"The hotel is in the city center. Everything works great. The room is spacious, beautiful and clean. The staff is very kind. Excellent breakfast in a beautiful room from which you have a view of the street and the park.","14406":"These People Deserve a great review as our stay in March 2019 was simply great - agree with Mark Woodcock the breakfast was very good -will stay here again when in Catania - Alfredo on reception particularly helpful and pleasant - he told us a great street to dine in which was enchanting - in fact it was the street behind the hotel - so left out the hotel - left again and on the left ! :) - thankyou staff of Etna Suites","14408":"This was an exceptional superb hotel. 10 out of 10 first class and the only hotel in which I have stayed at with nothing to fault. It was very clean, well maintained, the staff on reception very welcoming, the guy in the morning eating area was brilliant, the cleanliness of the cleaners was kept to the highest standards. The breakfast I had every morning was beautiful especially the warm fresh bread. Strongly recommend this hotel for all the above mentioned and its location is in an ideal area of Catania.  Thank you to all the Etna Suite Group from one very satisfied customer.  Mark Woodcock","14410":"Stunning panoramic views and tranquility. Perfect location to relax. Authentic converted buildings and Hassan the housekeeper is wonderful. The hotel is very remote and access takes a little practice but if you are looking for peace and quiet then the isolation is perfect. The views down to the sea are breathtaking and the amenities are more than adequate but not luxurious. You will have to hire a car as there are no transport links although taxis to Agrigento and San Leone cost about \u20ac30.","14411":"The hotel was great!it is situated at the center of Catania.great bteakfast with a variety of choices.The room was clean and the bed was very comfortable.The staff was very helpful and friendly and they helped us find transportation to Comiso","14417":"Stayed here last week. Clean, modern hotel that is located in a central location. Directly opposite the Bellini Gardens and a short walk to the main square and markets. Bus to and from the airport takes between 20-30 minutes and only costs about 4 euros. Taxi from airport would have cost 25 euros. Considering we had a room overlooking the main road, traffic noise is not an issue. Reception staff are polite and helpful. Breakfast is adequate. Shame it has no bar or communal lounge area. We would stay here again if returning to Catania.","14419":"I stayed at this hotel for just over two weeks. Rooms were spotless on arrival. The restaurant serves a buffet style breakfast (not included with room). Hot breakfast consisted of eggs(scrambled or boiled) and a thinly sliced ham type of meat(delicious) it also pastries, toast, cereal, cold cuts, cheese, and fruit, overall a good breakfast. Restaurant serves a nice variety of food as well for other meals. Staff are very friendly and helpful","14421":"We have known Parco degli Aragonesi for a couple of years but upon our last check in February 2020 we got told we had to pay a daily parking fee even if we were staying at the hotel! We found this appalling and we will surely stay somewhere else in Catania where everything is included as we feel welcome as opposed to cash-machines for any etxras.","14423":"Modern hotel in front of La Playa beach part of NH chain. Rooms are essential, fairly large and clean. Breakfast buffet is very good with a variety of food especially of daily cakes and croissants. Staff is professional and friendly. It is strategically positioned close to airport and not far from downtown.","14427":"I spent two months at this hotel on business. It was great. The staff is extremely friendly and willing to help in anyway. The Bar and a restaurant staff are extremely friendly. Thanks Alex, Anna and Fransica for making my long stay outstanding. I do plan to return with my wife during the summer to this hotel. See you in May or June. To travelers. I never make recommendations but I would stay here if possible. It is right across from the beach and within walking or a short car ride to city center.","14439":"Having arrived at Catania at 2110 we wanted somewhere close by for a couple of nights before joining an organised tour of Sicily. It is only a 10 minute drive (but cost \u20ac30 in a taxi!). Swift check in and a pleasant enough room on the ground floor. We had paid extra for breakfast which was a buffet. Pretty good though the scrambled eggs were a solid mass, not good. Tried to sit outside on the pleasant terrace but were driven inside by the wasps! Patio door in room onto a small terrace didn\u2019t keep the aircraft noise out and the aircraft take off pretty close. Nice pool, but doesn\u2019t open until 10am. Okay for a couple of nights. Buses stop right outside and costs \u20ac1 to get into Catania, about 10 minutes. Great little beach side restaurant opposite. Looks nothing but definitely worth going in for dinner.","14440":"Room air conditionning never came up with requested temperature( bad sleep) Only one bathroom shower towel. Carpets in the halls are disgustingly dirty The bread offered at the restaurant was hard as rock Overpriced! Stay away from this place! The only good thing about this place is beeing close to the airport.","14441":"This hotel is located outside Catania, near the beaches and the airport. We would usually take 15-20min by car to the city center. The area surrounding the hotel has some Lidos and restaurants, but it isn't a very pleasant place. Event the Lidos look abandoned. There are 2 public beaches (that we noticed) on the stretch of sand across the road, but you'll find much beter elsewhere in Sicily. Most of Catania is not well maintained, and that also translates to the care of the Hotel. The carpets and walls were stained. The rooms were big enough, had a nice balcony. The TV has a lot of international and sports channels. The bed wasn't very comfortable. We had breakfast the first day and it was underwhelming, especially for the price we paid. Also, why fisnish the breakfast at 10am? I don't get why hotels don't have more tourist friendly schedules. There is a nice pool area but a lot of wasps around. The staff was polite. They seemed to be in a hurry to clean the hotel in the morning, at 8-9 am you could hear the cleaning staff in the halls. We got a note before 10am because we had the Do not disturb card on the door, saying that if we really wanted the room cleaned we should tell the front desk. There is parking available for in the hotel for 5\u20ac per night, but there is room near the road to leave your car. At checkout there was some confusion with the price, because they had counted breakfast for all of our stay instead of just the first day, but it was quickly resolved. Overall, if this hotel was well kept it would be quite nice, but that is a big if. As it is, we were left disappointed.","14443":"Nice hotel near the sea with private sunbed, only for Hotel guests they have private lido so you can relax and they are FREE of charge plus they have a swimming pool with sunbed. Excellent breakfast, WiFi everywhere free of charge, bus stop for Catania city just outside the Hotel there is a bus stop, and few restaurants","14446":"This NH Hotel is south of Catania's city center, close to the airport. It offers a pool as well as a private beach access, has a restaurant and a bar. The facilities are OK but the overall structure did not convince me. It's called Parco degli Aragonesi but besides the patch of grass next to the driveway or the pool there isn't much of a park. On the back of the structure are only parkings... Besides one or two other hotels and a small restaurant(?) in a shack there are no pubs, no restaurants or similar in the vicinity. Hence, you are mostly stuck with what the hotel bar and restaurant have to offer unless you take a cab or your own car into Catania. There is an irregular bus service to Catania's Piazza Borsellino (which is quite central) but no real means to get to the airport besides a taxi. The ride takes about 5 minutes but they charge you a fixed rate of 20 EUR! No way of walking over there because of highways, gated lots and simply no walkways... The rooms are quite spacious and functional. The view out of mine was on the parking lot in the back though. The hotel is located on a busy four-laned street which also separates the property from the beach. The hotel pool is in front of the hotel towards that same busy road making it somewhat noisy even with a hedgerow between them. Each time you want to visit the little beach strip you have to cross the main road. Although there is a pedestrian crossing with street light, be careful as some drivers simply ignore it. The beach is quite OK and tended to with a little lounge area, sun chairs and a football court (soccer) on sand for the kids. They have a kiosk with selection of snack and drinks but you're not allowed to bring your own. There is a shooting range nearby so with the windows open your hear guns and rifles going off regularly throughout all hours of the day. It's not too disturbing but might be scary for little children or animals Overall, compared to other facilities I've visited in and around Catania I personally thought this one was not worth it's value for money. Personal negative experience: although I booked a rate distinctively offering a late-check out at 3pm, the receptionist told me that this was not possible so I had to clear my room at noon already and then hang out in the lobby until late afternoon to go to the airport for my flight. To the airport, of course, by cab for 20 EUR...","14447":"Quite a difficult one to write. There is a lot I liked about this hotel. Modern, own beach club, decent pool, nice restaurant, rooms small but clean well furnished, decent bed and also value for money. But.....  They need more staff, and in some areas, better staff. Always a queue at reception even to ask a simple question. Hard to find anyone at breakfast...at most I counted 3, rushed off their feet. Nice pool bar, friendly chap, but obviously having to multitask so rarely there. Beach club....not sure what they did. Gave you a towel as you walk in. Thats it. Weren't lifeguarding, too far from sea. Can I have diet coke?, none left, not let me ask hotel to bring more. Same with lunch at beach club kitchen probably closed , how about checking that?..In short, they'd figured out how to go to work doing as little as conceivably possible.  Bit more attention to detail too. We had no milk for our tea coffee making facilities. I asked for some cold milk in a jug to be kept in room fridge. Took 4 attempts, one of which included being given out of date congealed powdered milk sachets. The next day the cleaner removed the cold milk that took an hour to organise and we were back to square one.  Some of the staff were great...one of the waiters at lunch in restaurant. The bar guy, when there. Food was good quality.  In terms of location it was perfect for the beach wedding up road we attended, but do note the traffic into catania can be awful....an hour or more at worst of times. The trade off is pool Beach vs the huge array of bars rest in very lively town. In the heat of early sept, we were happy with our choice.","14450":"Between the ants crawling across the bed, the broken air conditioning and the lack of a sea view (unless I stood on the balcony railing) in a room advertised as having a sea view, I would say I was greatly disappointed in this hotel.","14451":"The hotel is actually perfectly reasonable and is in fact more close to a 3.5 rating than a 3. The staff is definitely a big plus for this place; friendly, service minded and professional - from a swift check in, helpful service at the private beach area (although they do allow the beach sellers to push their dresses, jewellery and plastic junk which can be somewhat annoying) to a capable housekeeping and friendly restaurant staff. The rooms are fine, but the hotel is close to the airport so expect the occasional overhead plane. Breakfast was nothing out of the ordinary. The private beach is well kept and the water is clean and clear; the sun chairs could potentially be upgraded for increased comfort. The pool area is also clean but it\u2019s way too close to the main road resulting in quite a lot of traffic noise. Parking changed from free to paid during our stay, but the system caused the hotel quite a lot of trouble. Prices were 5\u20ac per day, so fairly reasonable.  All in all a perfectly fine stay, but location is amongst all the other beach resorts.","14454":"Very friendly staff, very convenient location and very good quality breakfast. The rooms are very clean.I enjoyed the peacefulness and cozy atmosphere. Overall it was great. One of the cleaning ladies found one of my earrings I lost. Great attitude. Keep up the good work.","14457":"Not the most prime location. It features a restaurant and bar in the lobby which is convenient, and it is a good location in reference to the airport. The rooms were uncomfortably stuffy and there were car alarms going off all night long that the front desk said they could do nothing about.","14458":"The room is nice and clean, service was good. We had a sea-view room, which was sea-facing, but given that the ocean is across the street, there were buildings blocking our view.  There is also beach across the street with a private section for the hotel. The beach is nice and sandy with a view on Mount Etna.","14459":"I was there before and I came back. The less happy spot is the private beach: the bagnini could be much more friendly and polite, they could also clean the beach much much better! It is a scandal that people are still allowed to smoke on the beach and that there were butts (one of the most polluting object) everywhere. But the bagnini instead of spending hours talking with their friends they could collect them. The swimming pool is also nice, but if there is a sign that forbids people to jump in the water and people do it nevertheless, why the bagnino does nothing at all? The facilities are good, the service could be slightly better (but certainly above the average for Sicily) Finally the best of the best are the often neglected cleaning ladies: polites, discreet, efficient!","14462":"Had a wonderful experience at NH! Staff was very friendly and made me feel very welcomed. Close to the airport and had its own private beach area. Parking was easy and free! Breakfast was not free but worth every penny! I would stay here again for sure! I totally recommend it. Rooms were clean and the beds were comfy!","14464":"First time at this hotel...parking available on site... very clean room with comfortable bed and pillows- which is a plus.,, the bathroom was a little small but did suffice.. staff and service .. pool, bar facilities, breakfast and restaurant all excellent .. a special thanks to Giovanni for having such a great approach in such extreme heat which we encountered during our stay... I recommend this hotel..","14465":"We enjoyed our stay at this very comfortable and attractive hotel. The hotel is in a good location about ten minutes from the airport and a similar distance from the city. Local buses stop near to the hotel. There are a few interesting restaurants close to the hotel near to the beach. The hotel has a lovely private beach area over the road with good facilities, nice sand and the sea was both clean and warm to swim in. The good sized, pretty bedroom was extremely comfortable with a spacious balcony overlooking the immaculate gardens. Excellent sleep quality. Great bathroom. The breakfast was very high quality with an outdoor seating area. Eggs cooked to order. We did not eat in the hotel. The interior was very comfortable and relaxing.The swimming pool area was excellent with bar service,etc. The staff were efficient and looked after our bags after we vacated our room. The hotel does not have an airport shuttle and a taxi via the hotel is 20 euros. Recommended.","14466":"I spent three relaxing days in NH Catania Parco Degli Aragonesi. Everything was exelent and the staff very friendly and helpfull. I recomend the private beach! The breacfast was delicious! It`s a great place for relax and sightseeing tours.","14469":"Stayed for 1 night because of an extended flight delay. I chose the hotel based on brand, availability, on-line booking and proximity to the Catania Airport. Specifically, the hotel is one of the few facilities that has a pool which was ideal given the flight delay.  We checked in around 9:00 PM on a Saturday night. There was barely anyone to be seen at the hotel.  It is a modern facility directly opposite the beach clubs of Catania. While somewhat impersonal, the hotel is modern and super clean. Specific points of feedback include:  Rooms: Spacious, modern and clean. All the rooms appear to be identical. All have small outdoor terraces and are on the ground or first floor. All views are limited so I saw no real advantage to having booked a Superior view room over a Standard room. The bed was very comfortable and we had everything we needed in terms of toiletries, lovely towels, coffee, wifi, etc.  Facilities: The pool bar was open as was the restaurant. The pool was large with 30-40 lounge chairs but it does back up to the street. While they have created a lovely park-like setting, there is a lot of airplane and highway noise so it is not the most tranquil. That said, it was nice.  Staff: The front desk clerk and the barman were both very friendly and attentive. Interaction with them made our stay a pleasant one. We were quite looking forward to spending the day poolside waiting for our flight the next day.  And that is were the reality of hotel management set in.  I informed both the front desk clerk and the manager of our delay and rescheduled flight in casual conversation at check-in. They indicated that airlines send a lot of people there so they are familiar with the situation.  The next morning, I asked about a late check-out since our flight wasn't until 6:00 PM. It was the same front desk clerk and manager on duty.  The response was curt, inflexible and extremely inhospitable.  Lucrezia, the hotel manager, informed us that she couldn't extend check-out beyond 12:00. I appreciate this is standard policy.  I asked if we could store our luggage and use the pool for the afternoon while we waited. Lucrezia was very clear that would not be an option. She indicated that for insurance purposes, non-guests are not allowed at the pool.  I found this odd so I asked her if she had any suggestions for my 4-5-hour wait. She informed me that I was welcome to wait in the Lobby if I wanted.  I went to pack and think about my options and came back to check out at 12:00. I pressed about the pool and was told that the hotel was fully booked and couldn't accommodate us for the afternoon. Lucrezia failed to mention insurance so I clarified and she told me that they have a lot of people coming and going and just can't let me stay by the pool. The rigid rationale of 'insurance purposes' evaporated. Please note, there are 30-40 lounge chairs. Only 6 of them were occupied.  I asked her if she had any suggestions for lunch. She recommended the Pool Bar.  So, evidently I was welcome to pay to eat at the pool but still not allowed to use the pool or any of the lounge chairs at the pool.  It really felt like a contest with Lucrezia. She had told me 'No' and it was more important for her to stick with that initial response that find some way to accommodate her hotel guests. She obviously wanted us to spend 4-5-hours at the airport cafe than at the NH Hotel.  inexcusable.  I will certainly never stay at this hotel again and I will think seriously before considering an NH Hotel. There are lots of options. What started out as a pleasant airport hotel experience ended with me wondering Why did I bother?","14470":"Privet beach: in front of the hotel Comfortable bed. Good isolated rooms. Quite air conditioning in the room. Very friendly personal. Clean hotel, swimming pool and excellent breakfast. One of the front office employees remembered me from the last time and left a notice for me. See on the photo below. Highly recommended. And don\u2019t worry about the airport. You won\u2019t hear anything inside the hotel. (Also not much on the beach btw)","14474":"We found this hotel to have a very high standard. The staff are very helpful, friendly and approachable and they work so hard. The rooms are large, clean and comfortable. Breakfast is great and seems to cater for every taste. The pool is perfect and the beach is very close.","14476":"Good clean hotel. We had a water leak in the bedroom and room was changed swiftly. It lacks a few charging stations for electric vehicles in the car park. I will use this hotel and will recommend it provided I can change my car there.","14482":"This will be my second time at this hotel. Very nice customer service and great location. Walking distance to many shops and restaurants. Very clean and good size rooms. My next visit I will try the restaurant and hopefully have more to review. I am a fan of the NH in Catania.","14483":"close to the airport and good location to start your round trip. beach is in walking distance parking is available close to Catania Rooms are comfortable and have a balcony. as the hotel is close to the airport you should keep the windows closed to minimize the noise from the plains.","14488":"Stayed a night prior to flight out of Catania. Very nice looking place, very quiet local given time of year and very nice staff.Extremely comfortable room. Other guests very friendly, interesting people which reflects on hotel. if it had a poor reparation, such people wouldn't be there. Dining room an unfulfilled potential, limited wine list however very well presented and cooked meals. Would suggest management try and make room a fine dining focus for Catania and expand the wine list","14489":"Arrived late afternoon after arriving from France. Staff were efficient with our checkin and found our room to be large and clean and great to have a verandah. They booked us a tour to Mt Etna the next day. The breakfast had a large variety of food which was more than adequate and we ate in the restaurant for dinner and the food was exceptional along with the staff that served us","14498":"The location is great. It\u2019s 2-3min away from the bus station. The airport shuttle bus arrives here.  The room is clean, although the condiments were not enough.  WiFi reception is fast. I\u2019m satisfied.  Breakfast is not bad. The local cookies are savory.  The staff is helpful to give me the directions to the city center and deals with my equity by email quickly.  The price is so reasonable!!","14499":"Strange place clearly at the outskirts. Close to the airport and bus terminal but nothing else. The decorations are strange and outdated imagine gem stones and crowns decorating the hallways. Quite a trek into any sites. Gritty neighborhood Breakfast was fine but nothing great.","14502":"we chose this hotel after reading the reviews on Tripadvisor. As well as being extremely handy for both the train, car hire and airport, it was also a very nice hotel. Helpful concierges at the desk, fun decor, very good and varied offerings for breakfast and a charming inner garden terrace. There is even a little sitting room where the wifi signal is good. Also the price was very reasonable. Would definitely stay there again.","14503":"This hotel provides a brilliant location situated minutes away from the central station. A very pretty courtyard at the centre of the hotel doubles as eating area for breakfast and for relaxing at any time if the day. ...welcome place to stay in the shade and keep cool. The reception staff are second to none ....Francesco and the rest of the team helped us to navigate complex journies using public transport. This was vital when we aimed to get to Villa Romana de Casales with a very small smattering of Italian..and found ourselves totally stranded on two occasions...  All the staff here are superb...they work very hard to make you stay a success.","14504":"This is a comfortable hotel within easy reach of the bus stations and central railway station which is particularly useful if you don't intend to hire a car. The city centre is roughly 15 minutes walk away. The staff could not have been more friendly or helpful. The room was well appointed and comfortable with much-needed air-conditioning which was great after a hot day's sight-seeing! The hotel has a very individualistic decor which is unlike any other hotel I have stayed in (and is all the better for it!) and is arranged around a central courtyard where breakfast can be taken. Despite being near a busy main road the interior rooms and courtyard are an oasis of calm and quiet.","14506":"Lovely building, Good size room, stored our luggage, comfy bed, handy for bus and rail. Good cappuccino if you ask for it at breakfast. Reasonable choice of food, some good some bad. Although no drinks in the fridge other than water, there is a reasonably priced vending machine near the breakfast room.  The air conditioning wasn't on in our room, and it was impossible to find any instructions or work out how to use it. They turned it on at reception for us, but then I didn't dare adjust it! Not the normal remote control system. Poor juice at breakfast and the coffee from the urn was undrinkable (but cappuccino good). Not a very pleasant walk to the Old Town, (but if coming by rail you would have to go that way anyway if you were staying elsewhere)","14508":"Stayed here with family for 11days read all the reviews before booking.yes the area is rough but we had no problems .it's 3 minutes to train station ,5 minutes to bus station this gave us early morning trips to siracusa,Palermo,taormina,Agrigento,Naxos beach .The hotel staff were all great,especially the room cleansers.The breakfast is great also 10 10 .thanks for a great holiday","14512":"I loved my stay here! The hotel was very comfortable. Staff was very helpful and pleasant to deal with. I give you guys (Valerio and Francesco) 10 on a scale of 1 to 10. Hotel offers free WiFi in the entire building. Very clean and hygienic rooms. Loved the location and the breakfast. Close to airport (around 15 min by cab and 30 min on Alibus) walk able distance to the subway, buses, trains and restaurants. It was a good stay!","14514":"I chose this hotel for its location. It is right next to the train and bus station and only a 10 minute walk to the centre of Catania.  The staff just couldn\u2019t do enough for you, especially Francesco and Valerio. Valerio and Francesco told us all the places to eat and see and Valerio marked them all on the map for us. Valerio also found out all the bus times for us as we were heading to Ragusa Ibla next.  There is also a lovely courtyard and a wee sun terrace just off the courtyard. The hotel is quite traditional in its decor, which adds to it's charm. The bed was very comfortable and the air con was brilliant, had a great nights sleep. The rooms were spotless, tidy and spacious.  Would highly recommend this hotel, we can\u2019t wait to go back!","14515":"As others have said, the hotel is in rather a sketchy part of Catania near the train and bus stations, but I chose it purposefully because we were arriving from the airport by bus and travelling to Noto the next day by train. The walk after turning left out of the hotel and left again (as advised by Reception) 'en route' to the old town is decidedly sketchy so we came back another route after dinner but still managed to walk past three women selling their wares just yards from the hotel! The hotel itself is great value and I booked the most expensive room which was a deluxe including breakfast. The room was delightful, full of character and very spacious with two french window leading onto small Juliette balconies. This overlooked the road and the sea but with the shutters closed at night was absolutely silent. The bathroom was spacious but beware the jetted shower that if you turn the wrong knob when adjusting the temperature with the shower doors open, results in 6 powerful streams of water soaking you and the bathroom! Breakfast sat in the delightful courtyard was very good with a range of meats, cheeses, eggs, fruit, yoghurts, croissants and other pastries and the coffee was very drinkable. Service too was very friendly so no complaints at all. If I was to make any negative observation, it is the fact that in the heat, the hotel is a little too far to walk to the old town. Whilst not expecting too much from Catania on an overnight stay, it delighted us with its wonderful buildings and atmosphere. For the price I paid, the standard of accommodation, the breakfast and the convenience for our transport options, the overall package was very good. I can certainly see why it suits a lot of people who choose the Hotel Villa Romeo.","14517":"This hotel has a lot going for it. It is near the railway station, the bus station and only 15 minutes from the city centre on foot. The staff (Francesco, Gian-Marco and Valerio) were really kind and helpful. The room, although rather dated in its d\u00e9cor (the 1980s), was clean and had a decent bathroom. Breakfast was good and the ladies who served were also very pleasant. However, and this is no fault of the hotel, the area around it is very run-down and we weren't happy walking there at night. In the end, we went a long way round to get back from the centre each evening. If we were in Catania again we would definitely consider staying, but for us, the location was a drawback.","14518":"This hotel is very handy for the station, metro and airport bus and probably a 20 minute walk to the main tourist areas. The staff were very helpful and friendly. Our room opened out onto the courtyard which was a lovely place to relax with a book. The breakfast wasn\u2019t extensive but there was more than enough choices to suit most people. There was a flask with hot water in to make your own tea, but the temperature was a bit variable (I suppose depending on how much had been used and how long since it had been filled) I\u2019m generally very easy to please but become weepy alternating with diva-like if I don\u2019t get my tea fix. One day the water in the flask was barely tepid and did not make a decent cup. The lady presiding over the breakfast service was terribly sweet and used the coffee machine machine to magic up a teapot full of boiling water, and harmony was restored. I don\u2019t drink coffee but noticed she would make other types of coffee (cappuccino etc) than the one available on the buffet, if asked. It\u2019s definitely quite a quirky hotel, but is spotlessly clean and staffed with very nice people. I would recommend. Good WiFi.","14522":"The hotel is very well located for public transport with the main train, metro and bus stations only a few minutes walk away. The airport bus stops over the road too. Where the local transport failed to deliver travel to Etnaland (worth a day out if you're into that sort of thing), the hotel provided a very comfortable and pleasant transfer for us in their private minibus. We found it easy to explore Catania centre from here and did trips out to Taormina, Syracuse and Mount Etna all using local transport. The hotel is very clean, the staff are really friendly & helpful and the breakfast is really good with fresh fruit, cereals, cheeses, cold cuts, cooked eggs etc. (the freshly baked warm croissants were a firm favourite). There is a nicely decorated inner terrace where you can have breakfast as well as just relaxing at any time of day or night. Overall, this hotel is very good and exceptional value for money. Extra special thanks to Francesco - Grazie!","14524":"The hotel is incredibly handy for the train station which was ideal having arrived on a bus from the airport. Reception is a bit sparse but the chap was helpful and friendly. I'm not quite sure how to describe the interior d\u00e9cor - it's quirky to say the least but very interesting to walk along the corridors. Our room was pretty basic but had all the amenities required and a lovely little balcony over looking a pretty courtyard. Both were very pleasant places to sit and take a break for a while. We also used the roof terrace which was a great bonus for a couple of hours of sunbathing in a city location. Breakfast was fine, nothing fancy but you won't go hungry. Overall, a decent little hotel for a short stay.","14525":"We stayed one night after flying into Catania en route to Palermo. The airport bus (ugh!) dropped us at the station over the road and the bus to Palermo next day left from the depot 200m up the road...most convenient! Yes, the neighbourhood may not be the most salubrious but if you've done your homework there is little cause for complaint.  The room was clean and everything functioned as it should. Shutting our balcony doors cut the bulk of the noise from the incessant traffic nearby, closing the shutters blocked the rest allowing a good nights sleep.The mattress was comfy but its plastic cover a bit noisy. Breakfast was adequate coffee, fresh fruit and an avalanche of croissants in a pleasant rooftop setting. An excellent dinner can be had just around the corner at I Moschettieri in Via Marchese di Casalotto.  Full marks to the very helpful, personable Franchesco on reception, always ready for a chat and to provide local knowledge.","14526":"Loved villa Romeo was perfect location for us bus dropped us outside train station hotel just across road easy to find and sign posted . From the minute you entered hotel you got lovely warm feeling and great welcome from desk staff the hotel is quaint and quirky loved it . Rooms large and very clean good size bathroom whole hotel was lovely and clean . Buffet breakfast was great sat out on courtyard area in lovely weather having a relaxed breakfast what a way to start the day . 15 minute walk to main town area of cantina so not far away from everywhere. Definitely go again x","14527":"We spent two nights in Villa Romeo in March. The location worked well for us as we arrived in Catania by train and the hotel is located within a five-minute walk from the train station. The room was very clean and super quiet during our stay. The room was facing a beautiful garden with some wonderful flowers and plants, and we enjoyed sitting there after a long day of sightseeing. Major attractions are within a 15-20-minute walk from the hotel. Our stay was very short, but we did get a chance to meet the hotel\u2019s friendly staff. Alessandro was very helpful and kind to us. He made the airport transportation arrangement and was very attentive and hospitable and had a wonderful demeanor. Our stay in Catania was brief, but very nice.","14528":"I stayed in room # 109 for 3 nites, It is a big room with comfy bed, very clean and quiet facing the courtyard. It has a quiet AC and small fridge. I could hear the squeaky noise above me few times, but it did not bother or affect the rating. The location is safe and convenient , 5 min walk to bus station, 2 nice sicilian restaurants nearby, mostly local people dine. breakfast is sufficient and good. Fransceco, the manager is very nice and helpful as well as Valero-newly hired, they go extra mile to help..","14529":"Lovely old building beautifully preserved. Room was well appointed, bedside light, decent sized shower, etc. No tea coffee making facilities. Good breakfast with friendly people on duty. In fact all the staff were excellent - helpful, well-informed. Good location near buses and trains which we used to get to Milazzo,Syracuse and Taormina, very easy Alibus to and from the airport just over the road. Easy walk into centre of town, taxi back \u20ac10-\u20ac15.","14530":"The rooms are quite large and well appointed. The outdoor patios are great hang out areas. The hotel is close to a lot of attractions and the staff couldn't be more accommodating. They really care that your experience is great. Manager Francesco and driver Mario made our vacation perfect. Stay here if visiting Catania!","14531":"An old fashioned hotel with very friendly and helpful staff on the front desk. Room was ok and there was a large open air atrium for smoking etc. The breakfasts were a little sparse however (no real orange juice or anything hot). But overall ok.","14532":"Enjoyed my stay of 3 nights at Hotel Villa Romeo. The hotel is in a convent area, very easy to get to from Catania Airport by Alibus. Rooms very nice and comfortable, Breakfast , all you need served by a lovely lady. Reception staff welcoming and very helpful. Would stay again and recommend.","14533":"My wife and I spent 6 nights at Villa Romeo and enjoyed ourselves a lot. The staff was professional at checkin and at checkout. They provided recommendations for restaurants in the area and were helpful in terms of obtaining directions, etc. We had a very large room, #104, that was beautifully decorated, had a nice shower, very good WiFi. The AC was not turned on, but it was not needed as it was cool in Catania at the time. The breakfast was ok, nothing fancy but good. The breakfast area is adjacent to a nice garden area where breakfast can be eaten if the weather is good.  We chose this hotel due to its proximity to the main train station in Catania which is basically just across the street. The main sights are a bit of a walk, perhaps 15 to 20 minutes depending on the pace. There are local buses at the train station, but we did not use them.  Nice restaurants right around the hotel are few, but we did find two within walking distance. There is a Japanese restaurant right across the street with great food and lots of sushi. Another was about a 10-15 minute walk with great seafood and pasta.  Given a return to Catania, we would stay here again.","14535":"This Hotel is fabulous in every way. Very clean and comfortable rooms. Overall decor is good , a reminder of days gone by and suitable for the style of the building. What makes this Hotel so good are the Staff. Francesco is extremely welcoming and helpful. In particular we were returning our hire car in town. He arranged for the hotel shuttle to go with us and bring us back- when we arrived Europcar building was deserted- thedriver found we were given the wrong address. So he took us to the correct address. We are so thankful he was with us. THis is an example of just how good the Staff at this Hotel have been over our one night stay. Breakfast too is excellent !! Highly recommended","14536":"This is an interesting family run hotel with character. It has pleasant indoor garden areas for relaxing in. The hotel is clean and comfortable and is a few minutes walk from the Catania train station and an easy 10-15 minute walk to the Duomo. The staff are very helpful, particularly for us in arranging an early departure to the airport in the hotel van. They also recommended the restaurant around the corner, I Moschettieri where we had a delicious Sicilian meal in warm and friendly surroundings.","14539":"This hotel reflects the charm of the city. It is located minutes from central train station and within walking distance of the famous squares in Catania. Breakfast was a nice variety and staff were friendly and helpful. There are beautiful sitting areas outside every room!","14541":"We came to this hotel as we wanted to visit Italy and mount Etna, The hotel was a little hard to find at first but once found from the slightly run down side street opposite metro station there was a very welcoming receptionist. We were able to check on straight away. The hotel is very clean and ideal for us. It would be nice to know what the breakfast was before going . If you are into continental then fine but not much else and for 5 Euro somthing much tastier down towards the main square. No kettle in room but a fridge. We would come back to this hotel again","14543":"Great location for transport to airport next day. A great service from staff with an amazing garden terrace and if weather is good an ideal breakfast spot. Chilled out after a visit to Catania. Room was large and well appointed and good value.","14544":"We stayed in this hotel whilst on a city break in Sicily. The hotel staff were extremely helpful from booking. We booked direct as this was much cheaper than using any of the booking sites. Francesco, the hotel manager organised transport from the airport for us. He was extremely professional and helpful.  The hotel is located in a very convenient part of the city just opposite the train station and bus depot, about a 15 minute walk into the main square  Our rooms were very nice all opening onto patios one of which was covered and one was which was open giving us the option of where to set for our morning coffee or a glass of wine before our evening meal. Rooms were extremely clean and had fridges and TV.  Francesco could not do enough to help and advisers on the local restaurants and amenities. There is a restaurant literally around the corner that serves excellent Sicilian food and is very reasonably priced. There are also lots of other restaurants within 10 to 15 minute walk of the hotel.  The highlight of our holiday had to be a tour we did with a local gentleman called Alexandro Pallone. He was absolutely brilliant taking us to Etna, Tiormina, wine tasting and for a lunch by the sea in Nixcos. He entertained us the whole way with his singing and translated all of our conversations by his Bluetooth translator. He said he is very happy for us to share his number. I suggest contacting him on on Whattsapp +39 349 866 1251.  Everything about the hotel and holiday was perfect. I would strongly recommend both and intend to return with my daughter very soon.","14546":"My wife and I stayed at Hotel Villa Romeo during the first days of March. We chose this hotel for three main reasons. Firstly, we wanted an excellent place close to the Catania Centrale train station. Secondly, we wanted a 'good value for money' accommodation. And lastly, because of the ample positive reviews found all over the net. We arrived past midnight but we had absolutely no problems with checking-in. Room was very clean. Breakfast was excellent. Everything was tasty, especially the hot croissants. The only thing we really missed at breakfast was Nutella. All the hotel staff was very professional, but Francesco was super gentle and helpful. He always did his best to help us in whatever problem or request we had. The hotel is a stone's throw from the main train station. Piazza Duomo Via Etnea Piazza Stesicoro are about a 15-20 minute walk away, but all easily reachable by bus and or metro. We genuinely cannot think of anything bad negative about this hotel. Thank you everyone at Hotel Villa Romeo for making our holiday a special one. Arrivederci!","14547":"This hotel is conveniently located just one block away from Catania train station, which is also a stop for the airport bus. There is an excellent Sicilian restaurant (full of locals) just around the corner (I Moschettieri). There's also a cafe on the same street as the restaurant. The city centre is about a 10-15-minute walk away.  I really enjoyed my stay. The outside of the hotel (like most buildings in Catania) looks quite ordinary, but inside, the room was large and clean. The decor in the room was very calm, but the corridors are in Baroque style--very opulent and a real experience. The shower was very powerful. In summer, there's a nice courtyard to sit in with beautiful plants. The reception staff could not have been friendlier or more helpful. There was a group of difficult people staying when I was there and I couldn't believe how patient the staff were with them.  One of the highlights was breakfast. I woke up every morning to the smell of fresh croissants baking. There's a barista available to make espresso for those who want it and there are also cooked items, like scrambled eggs.  Overall, I thought think this hotel is incredibly good value for money.","14548":"Francesco Maravigna, Thank You for the gratuitous arrival greeting, The Garden Room you upgraded us to was Fabulous. Opening to the Court Yard Garden and steps away from your wonderful breakfast. The car that we rented stayed parked the entire time we were here. The hotel is across from the Train Station, Bus Central Location and fairly easy walk to the main tourist sites!  I wish I could give a Higher Rating!","14549":"This is my second time round staying in this Hotel for the same reason . Participating in a scale model exhibition held close by. The main reason for my second visit is because it is situated very close to the venue. It is well priced, very clean , very nice staff . Good breakfast and the rooms are very comfortable and spacious. This hotel offered a garage space to park my van safely and securely. Very highly recommended It is also walking distance from Via Etnea and there are many nice restaurants close by. I also enjoyed a pleasant walk by the sea towards the marina of Ognina. A very sweet place","14550":"Hotel Villa Romeo, is a beautiful hotel with stunning garden area. All staff was friendly, pleasant and professional. The room was clean and comfortable. The breakfast was great. It is right across the street for the train station and central locationed","14554":"This was by far the best 3-star hotel I stayed in during my time in Italy. This small hotel was right across the street from the train station. It was an elegant hotel nicely decorated and charming. The room was clean and quiet, with shutters on the windows to make it pitch dark at night. I really slept well. The breakfast was awesome and included traditional Sicilian antipasti as well as the usual sweets, eggs, and great coffee. The staff were friendly and helpful. I would definitely stay here again.","14557":"Hotel only 10 mins from bus station - Front desk so welcoming and English speaking my room was very clean- fresh linen towels very white and fluffy, spotless bathroom lots of power points - fabulous breakfast fresh coffee made by a barista - Francesco desk manager goes beyond  he is one in a million  I have no hesitation in recommending this hotel for their excellence","14559":"i was only one night in this beautiful hotel and everything was great great breakfast there are 2 beautiful terraces where you can have breakfast a particular thanks to francesco who is a really kind and professional personwho made my stay unforgettable","14560":"The hotel is only a few minutes walk from the train station and the bus station. The last stop of the airport bus (Alibus   AMT) is at the train station, and from there about 3 minute walk to the hotel. The included breakfast was good and if the weather is fine there is a nice outdoor area. Staff were very pleasant and helpful.","14561":"The staff were very polite & helpful, the breakfast selection was very generous. The central garden was a beautiful except for Smokers polluting the fresh air. Room clean with free water and short walk from the bus depot.","14562":"The hotel is located across the road from the train and bus stations. Not a great location for a night walk very typical of an area near a train station but very close to all the other attractions in Catania. They offer limited secured parking. However, the hotel is very secure, he room was clean and had a door that opened into a beautiful courtyard with sofas and chairs that you can enjoy in the afternoon. The staff was very helpful and friendly.","14564":"The hotel is located across the road from the train and bus stations and thus is well sited for allowing visitors to explore the east coast of Sicily. It's about a ten minute walk to the tourist area of the lively central city, there was a huge street festival when I visited. The hotel's neighborhood is a little seedy and pretty typical of an area near a train station; if you return after dark, you may have to wend your way through some working girls a short walk from the hotel. However, the hotel itself is very secure, and the room I stayed in was clean, modern and quiet. Breakfast is adequate. The interior courtyard is a comfortable place to sit out in the early morning, though the bees chased me indoors. The staff was helpful and friendly; they booked a tour of Mt. Etna for me.  This is an excellent value that offers mid-range accommodations for the price of a budget hotel.","14566":"Very close to the railway station; metro; taxi rank; bus station and airport shuttle stops. From the outside quite off putting but inside is very good. The breakfast courtyard is lovely. Rooms are spacious and spotlessly clean. Bathroom has toiletries and hairdryer. There is a fridge but no tea making facility. Staff friendly and helpful. About 15 minutes walk from the centre of town. For a 3 star hotel very good indeed.","14570":"We spent 3 nights at Hotel Villa Romeo and really enjoyed our stay. It is a quick 2 minute walk from both the bus terminal and the train station and a comfortable walk to the city centre.  Our room was spacious and very clean and the staff at reception were exceptionally helpful whenever we needed their assistance - whether a recommendation for a restaurant for dinner or directions for sightseeing.  Breakfast in the courtyard was also excellent and I\u2019d defined stay again should we return to Catania.","14574":"Good Hotel, near the centre of Catania, in walking distance of all the attractions and many restaurants, bars etc. The rooms was comfortable and the breakfast good. It's very convenient hotel to visit Catania and all the territory.","14575":"We had an issue with a rental car and couldn\u2019t manage the problem with the phone numbers we had. Maria. A. at the desk, called the numbers to help sort out the problem, then invited us to stay in the lobby area after we checked out but were waiting for a car. Without her help, I don\u2019t know what we would have done. She went \u201cabove and beyond\u201d to help. When we returned a week later, she asked about the car issue and our trip and once again was friendly and helpful. The breakfast was outstanding also.","14577":"This is a clean hotel but the facilities are old and in need of updating. The staff is friendly and the included breakfasts are wonderful. The views from our room included Mt. Etna and that was a terrific bonus. The location is excellent, right in the center of Catania and close to everything.","14582":"Very well positioned jotelnin centre of catania, close to all main roads. Very clean, all amenties available in hotel, very good parking available and safe for overnight stay.. ery aarm rooms and Restaurant","14590":"Stayed here each year in Nov for the last 5 years. Breakfast gone down hill. Often No yogurt out. Poor selection of fruit. Coffee poor. Stayed 11 nights, so we had a good chance to compare. Otherwise hotel in good location and staff friendly.","14592":"Room was nice and tidy. The staff was friendly especially at the reception that were very friendly and welcoming. Breakfast looked great, but as a Celiac person, there wasn't a big option of Gluten free breakfast.","14597":"The most nice and friendly Hotel in the City of Catania, with a special service in case of loss of a personnel belonging. Good location for City lovers without car. Good Restaurants arround easy to reach by walk.","14598":"A delicious breakfast. Spacious room, bed was comfortable, but the bedsheet had at least one hole. We did\u2019nt check the whole. The sink in bathroom had drains problem. The water gathered in the sink and we had to wait in between until all the water has gone down. Not an impressive standard for the price.","14599":"High end operation, with an excellent location central to most things you may want. Very modern and clean. We were on a tour and everyone loved the hotel. Not all room had excellent views, but none were bad.","14604":"Good central location. Service at the desk was friendly and helpful. They made some nice suggestions for restaurants. Lobby was extremely congested at times with groups and elevators got backed up. Breakfast was pretty average but the price was good. Could use more fresh fruit on the buffet. Also - having just the one serve yourself coffee machine does not work. It is very slow, makes only average coffee, and there always seemed to be a line of people waiting for coffee. Please change to having the waiters serve the coffee. The beds are comfortable.","14607":"This hotel is a bit further up the hill from the center but within walking distance. The room was average and needed some TLC. it smelled like naphthalene. Free Parking is limited and some spots were taken by hotel staff instead of keeping them for hotel guests. A couple of ladies at the Front Desk were a bit unwelcoming. The night shift staff was more friendly. It's an okay hotel for the rate they offer but there are better ones around.","14608":"Stayed only for one night on a business trip. Good location to access the Main Street restaurants and bars. I didn\u2019t eat in the hotel so I cannot comment on the restaurant but looking at the menu I would recommend you go to one of the many restaurants near by. Would have no hesitation staying here again. I was advised by a local colleague to be careful in Catania with your bag or backpack as it is not unheard of for someone to cut your straps and run off with your bag. I personally did not see anything that concerned me during my stay but you can never be too careful.","14613":"My friend and I stayed for an evening. The hotel is clean and our stay was good. Only feedback is that parking in the area of the hotel is an issue if you didn't book a garage spot onsite before the trip. I wish I had that information before the visit as it made check in chaotic. When we checked in, they explained it was sold out for the evening. If it wasn't for a kind man who lived in the area, we really wouldn't have known exactly where to park and how to pay for it without getting a ticket or towed.","14617":"Overall the room was very nice and clean with airconditioning. It was not clear that there was a bus stop for the airport RIGHT OUTSIDE so I had a creepy evening walk from the train station. Staff didn't really know how to get anywhere without a car, so I had to figure the buses out myself.  There's a really nice street of restaurants about a ten minute walk away on Via Santa Filomena - lots of choice. But there's not much around this hotel. Not ideal for a trip to the beaches or going up Mt Etna. Stay closer to Borsellino if you can.","14618":"Perfectly located in the heart of Catania. Easily walking distance to great shopping, food, and tourist attractions. Free parking included. Very clean rooms and bathrooms. Iron available at front desk upon request.","14622":"It was clean front desk excellent. It's a little tired. Has no bar or cafe despite having it set up. The restaurant is dull & feels like a hall zero atmosphere. Poor selection if buffet breakfast. The bars around the area are much better. Not far from main street 15 min walk. Just 4 star us fair to say. Small rooms.","14628":"Good location. Average rooms. Building and room needs updating. Close to ammenities in the city centre. Breakfast is average. Staff are helpful but the maps supplied are useless - photocopy of previous hotels maps!!","14629":"The hotel is conveniently located if you are travelling by plane and take the airport bus, which stops directly next to the hotel. The city center is a 15 minute walk away. The friendly staff at the check-in desk allowed me to check in early, which was very appreciated after an early morning flight to Catania.  The rooms are dated really need refurbishment. The only modern thing inside is the flat screen TV, which unfortunately has only very few English channels. My superior single room 726 was a bit dusty on the inside, the window dirty on the outside and the bathroom had a light bad smell coming out of the shower drain. There was also no conditioner or body lotion, which I expect in every 4 star hotel. By the way, on the official website it's stated that every room has a rainshower, which is a bit exaggerated, since it's just a round flat, but small shower head, which isn't even mounted on the ceiling. Also it said, that there should be a kettle with a coffee and tea set in my room category, but it seems like only the more expensive rooms have this. Not that I care that much about it, but I think nh hotels should not advertise it, if it's not what they really offer. There was an AC control, which did nothing, since the hotel had central AC on. The bed however was comfortable to sleep on.  The breakfast was sufficient in terms of choice and quality, however on both mornings during my stay, they quickly ran out of the better bread and only the pre-cut toast bread was left. There weren't even that much other people except me, so I don't know why that happened. Everything else was quickly restocked.  For the price and location, the hotel is ok, but don't expect anything special or luxurious here.","14631":"Had just one night on my way to Catania airport. Comfortable and clean. Close to stop for airport bus. Delightful staff. Would stay again if I could. Breakfast was tasty and the town just a short walk away.","14639":"it is just what you can expect from a NH. Good room, good bed, good bathroom, good wifi, good TV, good breakfast, good location. Very good quality for money and good location. I absolutely reccomend it.","14642":"First off the staff was great and welcoming. They were professional and courteous. The hotel was in a great location and walking distance from plenty of food places. There was even a convenient store about 2 blocks from the hotel. I found a variety of food places all walking distance from the hotel. My room was pretty small but perfect size for 1 person by themself. I'm sure there are other rooms more accommodating for families. The room was clean hiwever I wasn't able to control the overall temperature of the room, aside from opening my window. I needed to sleep during sun up hours and the blinds kept most of the sun out as I was able to sleep. Overall I was satisfied with my stay and had no issues with the room or the staff.","14645":"Amazing place, very well located and decorated. I liked seeing beautiful flowers on the ceiling every morning after waking up. The balcony with tables and chairs was also a special treat. But the real value here was the friendly hosts, delicious breakfast and absolutely clear online check-in instructions. This is important, especially if arriving late at night.","14648":"Emmanuelle is a wonderful host and very accommodating. We had made a mistake and booked the wrong Sunday in February. Nevertheless, when we arrived on the wrong day, he went out of his way (during his day off) to arrive promptly at the B&B, quickly make up an available room for us, and help us cancel the wrong reservation. He recommended a lovely restaurant for dinner. In the morning, he offered us free coffee in the bar right below the B&B on the piazza. The rooms are beautiful - modern and stylish in a old building. The room we stayed in (on the corner) is a bit noisy as it overlooks a piazza, but all other rooms seem to look on to an internal courtyard and are therefore quieter. Would recommended this lovely B&B.","14649":"Thank you Emmanuel for taking such good cate of us! This review is over due. We are so glad we stayed at Sciara Larmisi. We had a very spacious room. The breakfast was great! The property is located w in walking distance to everything we wanted to see. We loved Catania! What a beautiful city! We\u2019d read a lot of negative reviews...none of which were brought to light on our visit. We took the hop on hop off bus (which we highly recommend). We saw the beautiful coast and many sights we\u2019d never have seen if we hadn\u2019t taken the city bus tour. Catania is a do if you\u2019re in the area! You\u2019d be happy with B&B Sciara Larmisi and the wonderful care from Emmanuel!","14650":"Welcoming per SMS OK after the normal business hours. Room as advertised.  WRNING: Just arriving and when trying to turn the hot water in the shower accidentally hit the shower door frame. VERY SHARP! Leaving to the pharmacy now to get some disinfectant...","14657":"Large, comfortable, very clean rooms. Very good location within walking distance of the central piazza and with a small piazza directly across the street. Gracious, personable and very helpful hosts - Emaneule and Ada. A beautiful breakfast patio and a substantial breakfast. This B&B checked all the boxes!","14658":"My husband and I stayed here for 3 nights, overlooking a square and very well placed for restaurants, shops, sights and local transport. Our room was large with a shower room and separate toilet. Simply furnished with tea and coffee tray, fridge which had complimentary soft drinks. Toiletries supplied and even an iron and ironing board. Breakfast was very good with plenty of choice. The owner, Emanuel, is very helpful with suggestions and advice. If I return to Catania I would definitely stay here again. A trip to Taormina by local bus cost us \u20ac16. 60 and was well worth it as the journey was nice and Taormina is beautiful.","14660":"Situated close to the city centre. This accommodation was excellent. A very friendly welcome and good quality breakfast included. The room was very comfortable and spotlessly clean. Great facilities. I would definitely recommend to anyone visiting Catania.","14662":"We stayed at the B&B the night prior and post for our Malta and Sicily cruise. The location was excellent! 10-15 minutes walk to the port where our ship was docked. It was close enough to the Piazza del Duomo for us to walk. Emanuele was a wonderful host. Our room pre-cruise was very large and comfortable. Our post-cruise room was a bit smaller and still very comfortable. The breakfasts were very satisfying and a good variety of food. We appreciated the fact that we could left our luggage at the B&B while we did our sightseeing of Catania. We highly recommend this B&B to anyone who wishes to stay in Catania near the city center.","14666":"On our last night in Sicily we stayed at Sciara Larmisi. This is a wonderful B&B with updated rooms - very clean. The location was great and they have a beautiful patio to sit and relax. They also serve a very nice breakfast. Our host was helpful, pleasant, and made us feel very welcome. We would highly recommend this B&B.","14668":"This charming B&B is in a wonderful situation on the 3rd floor of a typical old Palermo building with some rooms overlooking a square and garden. Breakfasts were served on the balcony of our room en plein air with lovely views out across the town to the sea. The rooms had simple but beautiful decor reflecting and highlighting some of the architecture and original features of the several hundred year old edifice. White plaster, coloured tiles, wood and glass. Very comfortable and clean rooms. Bathrooms to be enjoyed too. Delightful. The staff were SO friendly and helpful. Francesco (\u2018the boss\u2019) welcomed us and gave us lots of information on the town, Luciano chauffeured us to and from the airport and Alessia served us delicious breakfasts every morning. Happy and friendly people who were not put off by us communicating via google-translate! The only drawback I could envisage for some would be the 4 or 5 flights of stairs to climb to get to the property: fine if you are relatively fit but not suitable if you have any disability...","14674":"Petrosino seems like it's out of the city centre but is actually in a lovely old part of Palermo and really close to the Port! Not to mention quite lively on a Saturday night! Looses 1 star for the soft bed (I prefer a harder mattress!). Allesandro contacted me the day of arrival after the initial booking to check our check-in time and made sure he was there to meet us. He did over and above making sure to recommend restaurants and things to see! The room was fantastic and overlooked the garden (really quiet!).","14675":"My husband and I stayed here on our last night of a two week Sicily vacation. Emanuele was very responsive to all questions and has a gorgeous bed and breakfast for his guests. He also has slippers, toothbrushes... he\u2019s thought of everything. The location is on a cute square filled with locals. It\u2019s a quick walk to the main piazza and luckily we were able to see the famous fish market before it closed. Emanuele also gave us great recommendations that we used for lunch and dinner. We spent time on the roof deck with a bottle of wine and had a wonderful place to relax. Breakfast was abundant and delicious. My husband and I had different flights out and he arranged taxis for us both. (The bus to the airport is literally across the street but it was raining so I didn\u2019t use)We would highly recommend this for your Catania stay!","14682":"We arrived and were received by a very professional and hospital team member, who also gave us advice on the city, its monuments, insights and restaurants. Our beautiful double bed room hat everything in it you could possibly want and need. Being near Via Vittorio Emanuele the B&B is located as good as it gets in Palermo. You are in walking distance to culture, food and nightlife. Again big thanks to the very responsive and helpful team (for this regards a special thank to Luciano for helping us out with the car!)","14683":"Good location, exceptional rooms, upgraded w  air conditioning, has elevator and close to Piazza del Duomo (5 to 10 minute walk). Ada was a tremendous hostess. She was there when I arrived, gave me several recommendations for meals, served a nice breakfast and went out of her way to make my stay a positive one. REAL customer service.","14691":"This is the best bed and breakfast we have been to and we usually stay in hotels during city breaks however this beats any hotel out there. The rooms are so quirky and authentic, with typical Palermo street square views. The bathroom shower was amazing! The breakfast was delicious and it was so sweet eating it out on the balcony in the sun. The staff are so friendly and helpful, especially Sandro! The rooms are also very clean. The location is perfect, my favourite part of the City, a very authentic Palermo feel. If we come back to this City we will stay here and we will recommend it to any family or friends who wish to visit beautiful Palermo!","14693":"We only had one night here but it was fabulous. Our hosts were helpful, friendly and the breakfast was made to order and delivered to the room. A really comfortable bed, and a great view. The location is very central and easy walking distance to everything.","14697":"Sandro and his wife were extraordinary kindly, smiley faces and helpful. Rooms are very clean and comfortable. Breakfast super good. Location is central. Closed to everywhere. Almost perfect. Enjoy it","14700":"As corny as it sounds to say that it was 'home from home', it really was. Emanuele was not only warm and caring, to the extent that he apologised for the weather being too hot! He was also really helpful with excellent restaurant recommendations and, in fluent English, lots of ideas concerning what to visit but also honest, as to what was not so good. The B&B is beautifully decorated, cool, and restful. Our room was quiet, spacious with a huge comfortable bed and clean. Not only would I recommend the location and the accommodation, but we intend to return, as our stay here was as enjoyable part of the trip as Catania itself, rather than just a base as we normally tend to select.","14706":"We stayed here for the week. Emanuele is wonderful host. Very personal care. He speaks fluent English. He greets you awaiting your arrival with warmth. He makes sure you are welcome and settled. He has great recommendations for the area such as Al Vicolo Pizza & Vino - yummy! The rooms are freshly designed really nicely with thick walls and double glass doors so you can sleep well. The breakfast is fresh and there is cute patio facing the park to eat and relax. HIGHLY recommend staying here. Thank you!","14710":"This B and B is owned and run by a particularly lovely you g man who was once a banker but decided that banking was not the life for him. He has renovated 12 rooms, our group had three of them. All were extremely comfortable, the position is very very good, a very short stroll to the duomo, unesco sites, shopping and many restaurants nearby. One of our rooms was on the third floor and was really a small apartment. Breakfast was more than adequate. Thank you Emanuele next time we\u2019ll stay longer.","14711":"Emanuele deserves every praise and recommendation as the host of this lovely B and B. He goes above and beyond to ensure that your stay in Catania is enjoyable. This place is a sea of tranquility in the hustle and bustle of Catania. After a bad experience with a taxi driver Emanuele went out of his way to negotiate a discounted tour for us and gave up his commission! He was also able to arrange a shuttle to Taormina at extremely short notice when the bus company changed the timetable and we could not fit on the only bus. Having someone local to help out is so valuable as local arrangements are somewhat confusing and subject to change without notice! If you want a home away from home in Catania with great rooms, a fine breakfast and a host who cares about you and loves his city then do not hesitate to book B&B Sciara Larmisi.","14712":"This is a lovely spot very close (6 minute walk) to all the main sights in Catania. The rooms are huge and very nicely done. Ours was on the back side and very quiet. Breakfast was delicious, and Emanuele could not have been more helpful with our questions and our needs. We were very happy to have chosen this spot for our stay in Catania.","14714":"This is one of the best places we\u2019ve stayed in Sicily and Italy generally. The day before Emanuele texted me for an expected ETA. I said we\u2019d be arriving a little earlier than check in since we were arriving by bus. (Side note: only 10-minute walk to the bus and train station, 1-minute walk to airport bus stop). Our room was free so he let us check in a little bit early. We needed to do some laundry urgently and were flying out the following day so asked for a laundromat recommendation. He went above and beyond and did it for us, free of charge! Never had such hospitality before. We also had to catch an early bus to get to the airport. Since it was too early to get the breakfast there (which I\u2019m bummed we didn\u2019t get to try because I\u2019m sure it was great), he gave us a card to get free coffee and breakfast downstairs (again complementary). The B&B itself is charming, well decorated, and just lovely and comfortable. There\u2019s a terrace that you can use at anytime (read a book, drink a glass of wine) and the room itself was gorgeous (and spacious) too! There are double-paned windows so it\u2019s so quiet inside which made for good sleeping. The bathroom was beautiful as well and by far the largest shower we came across in our stays in Italy. All the drinks in the mini-bar are complementary. There are many sights and good food options nearby so its location is good too. Emanuele beautiful place makes you feel like you\u2019re visiting family, and his warmth and hospitality makes it even better. We will be back for a longer stay next time. Grazie ciao!!!","14720":"We loved our stay at Sciara Larmisi. The best feature is the wonderfully welcoming staff. They were helpful in every way and made us feel genuinely at home. We had a lovely room with a spacious bathroom. The breakfasts are fantastic with a large variety of delicious treats. You can also use the kitchen if you wish. It\u2019s in a great location, ten minutes walk from Piazza Duomo and is really convenient for tour pick ups. There are numerous great restaurants and cafes nearby.","14722":"We stayed at the Sciara B&B for a week in early May. It is a wonderful place to stay. Emanuele, the owner, is a superb host full of local knowledge and very helpful. The B&B is situated in a beautifully restored baroque building on a piazza on the edge of the old city of Catania. It is within easy walking distance of the city centre and restaurants and the bus and railway stations. I have no hesitation in highly recommending it.","14729":"We are so happy we stayed at Sciara Larmisi! Emanuele is an exceptional and conscientious host who gave us excellent recommendations and driving directions throughout our stay in Catania. He prepares a generous breakfast buffet each day with enough variety to suit anybody and of the many people we have met during our travels, he is one of the most engaging and fun to talk too. Our comfortable room was modern and spacious with a window that faced the back of the building and free parking on the street with a security guard on duty at night. We were very happy with the location and found it very convenient for walking around Catania.","14730":"First of all, driving into and out of Catania is only for the brave -- we are NYC natives, and our nerves were shot negotiating the bumper-car craziness. And, finding free parking anywhere in Catania can be downright insane. Which is why Sciara Larmisi is such a great find -- free parking directly opposite the front door!  Our room was small, but clean, but we faced the main drag which is noisy from early morning until late at night. I think most rooms face that way, so be warned. The breakfast spread is adequate, and Emanuele makes a mean cappuccino. It's a long'ish walk to the main square and other sights, but not unreasonably so, and you will get your own set of keys to come and go as you please.  Plus, the price is right!","14731":"We never met a B&B host as friendly and accommodating as Emmanuelle! I always use TripAdvisor to help with vacation planning, and the glowing reviews cannot fully describe the hospitality, value, and location of this B&B. The breakfast room and terrace are amazing, the rooms are immaculate, and the location is very convenient. It was a short walk from the train station, and the bus to the airport was right across the street! This was our first trip to Sicily, although we had visited Italy many times. We were surprised at the beautiful architecture in Catania, the views of Mt. Etna, and the real life vibrancy of the city, especially at the fish and produce market. Initially we chose to stay in Catania to visit Mt. Etna, not realizing that the mountain would be too snowy in the winter for us to go there. But there was plenty to see in Catania for two days and the direct flight back to Venice was very convenient for us. Even though we had an early flight, we were able to help ourselves to breakfast items in addition to those that Ada packed for us. Our refrigerator had free drinks in it, and we were told to help ourselves to more drinks - soda, iced tea, water - available in the breakfast room. We were really made to feel welcome by Emmanuelle and Ada.","14738":"We chose to stay at the B&B Sciara Larmisi because of the glowing reviews. As this is our first visit to Sicily, we had no idea what to expect. Well, I have to say we were not disappointed. Our host Emmanuel was perfect! He anticipated every need and even rescued us when we got lost trying to find our way to the location. He always remembered to ask us about our plans for the day --- and then follow up to find out how it all worked out. While maintaining the highest degree of professionalism, he managed to come across as genuine and warm. The breakfast was more than adequate - a generous spread of eggs, cold cuts, croissants, jams, yogurts and more. It kept me going through our tours until dinner. The room and common areas were clean and charmingly decorated ... like someone's very well kept home. Best of all was the location - this cannot be beat. It is walking distance from the Duomo and steps away from the bus stop. 4 Euros to from the airport. I could not even think about returning to Catania without staying at this charming B&B. This definitely made our trip to Catania special and memorable. A bug Thank You to Emmanuel!","14739":"The show is stolen by Emmanuelle, he is super nice, very informative and makes the entire stay fantastic. However, that does not take from he fact that the place is well located, with beautiful view of the plaza, clean, modern, nice bkf etc. Excellent choice to stay in Catania!.","14740":"Emmanuele is a wonderful host. He makes you feel at home and he takes pride in good hospitality. The location is good, a 5-10 min walk from main attractions in Catania. The room was large and comfortable with 2 small balconies. The breakfast was very nice and the terrace is a great place to relax.","14741":"We stayed at the Sciara Larmisi for four nights in November. The hosts, Manuele and Ada were wonderful. The booked us a fabulous 6 person tour of Mt Etna for only 60 euros each. The tour picked us up before the normal breakfast time but they cooked us an early breakfast so we could make the tour. A great location, walking distance to all major attractions and local bars for evening entertainment. We were in Italy for a month in seven different cities and the best bed by far.","14742":"Stayed here for a few nights. Everything\u2019s provided kettle, fridge ( with free drinks ) etc, very clean, king size bed, friendly helpful service, easily walking distance to all the sights,airport bus stop just a couple of minutes walk away.","14744":"This place was great! The location was great! The breakfast was great! Homemade things to eat every morning.The owner was wonderful. He was very friendly and helpful. We had a wonderful stay! I would definitely stay there again! The room was very spacious and clean. We felt very welcomed. The roof terrace was a wonderful place to enjoy breakfast and a great view! We had to leave before breakfast on our last day and the owner made sure we got a breakfast at the shop next door. Thank you so much for a wonderful stay!","14752":"Our stay here was very brief as we arrived at lunch time and departed very early before breakfast the next day. However, Emanuele was there when we arrived and was very pleasant and helpful. The b & b is beautiful and stylish and every need is catered for. Our room was spacious and comfortable (the only downside was that it overlooked the main road and was, therefore, quite noisy). Perhaps a room overlooking the square would be a little quieter. The location was fine and within short walking distance of the Duomo. The breakfast area and terrace looked lovely and it was unfortunate not to be able to take advantage of them.","14762":"We visited B&B Sciara Larmisi in july 2018!  The B&B is located well, just outside of the crowded centre, which is just a 5 minute walk.  When we arrived, we were welcomed warmly by the host Emanuele. Who is a very pleasant and helpfull host. He knows the best beaches, restaurants and shopping streets, and is more then willing to reserve then for you.  The room was delightfull! All the details were matched. A beautifull original tiled floor. There is also a very nice toofterrace where you can enjoy the breakfast or a drink in the evening.","14764":"I cannot praise this little B&B enough. Ada who met us was so smiley, and made us incredibly welcome even though we were too early to officially check in. The room was clean, stylish, and well laid out. The air con was effective and quiet. The fridge in the room was topped up daily with free soft drinks and the roof terrace was lovely. Breakfast was every nice. Ada managed to book us a trip up Etna for the day after we arrived, and even made us sandwiches. Nothing was too much trouble. The location was great, walking distance to all of main Catania, the bus station, and bus to the airport. An oasis of calm in the madness of Catania. Thank you so much for making my birthday trip memorable.","14770":"Spent 2 nights here near the end of May and quite happily would have stayed for longer. Emanuele speaks perfect English and is a wonderful host with so much information,whether it is for travelling around the area or restaurants and bars. His advice and recommendations made our holiday much more enjoyable. The whole property is clean with lots of stylish touches. Our room had a lovely large very comfortable bed and pillows with crisp cotton bedding. Good shower with the choice of a hand held of waterfall shower and good lighting above the sink too for applying make up. There was also a small fridge and the bonus of a kettle so I could make my morning green tea before going for breakfast, which was held in a cute breakfast room or could be taken on the beautiful terrace. The stop for the airport bus is very close and can actually be seen from the front terrace. Would not hesitate to stay here again. Highly recommended.","14772":"What a lovely place to stay whilst in Catania. Emanuele is a fantastic host who ensures his guests are happy and obviously takes pride in his B&B. He contacted me the day before we arrived to see if I needed any help with directions from the airport and explained which bus stop to get off at. Once there he was happy to provide us with information on things to do in town and also arranged for us an amazing day trip to see Mt Etna with a guide. The B&B itself can't be faulted. The room we had was large, clean and very modern and comfortable. We had a view of both the front street and local piazza. The french doors were double glazed and so hardly any noise could be heard inside the room from outside. The bathroom was also very clean and modern. The location is brilliant. Only one stop on the Alibus from the airport and a very short walk to everything you want to do and see in town. Restaurants and bars are all a short walk. The breakfast on the terrace was a lovely way to start each day. I would definitely stay here again if ever back in Catania and will be recommending this place to all my friends.","14774":"We stayed 3 nights in this delightful B&B in Catania last week. The hotel is an easy walk away from the centre. The room was stylish and spacious with a lovely huge bathroom equiped with a power shower as well. Breakfast was the typical Italian fare but with eggs and cold meats too should you want them, which is fairly unusual for Italian B&Bs. Breakfast was served either in the charming Breakfast Room, or if you preferred, on the extensive terrace overlooking the piazza.  Our host was extremely helpful, especially pointing out where and when to get busses and trains from.  Highly recommended if you're staying in Catania.","14785":"We stayed here for two nights in November and couldn't be happier to leave. The rooms were not insulated and the street noises and noises from other guests could be heard throughout the night. The employees are inhospitable and one employee was downright rude. She had the nerve to raise her voice and roll her eyes at me when I attempted to communicate in my broken Italian. At least I tried. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone when there are so many other lodging options in Palermo that treat their guests with respect and courtesy.","14787":"We stayed in Zamm\u00f9 for three days.... ideally situated in a quiet street within easy walking distance of all Palermo's sights.... and were impressed not only by the quality, cleanliness and comfort of the beautifully designed rooms, the excellent breakfast choice ....home made cake, delicious croissants, fruit, cheese, ham etc.... but also the free use of the open plan kitchen and lounge area. Above all Massimo and his charming wife were so helpful and welcoming... their airport pick-up is great value. We will definitely be back, and heartily recommend Zamm\u00f9!","14792":"Room was clean, it had comfy beds, good air-condition. Bad sound isolation, NO W-FI, average breakfast (no real bread, just toast bread), average coffee; staff doesn't speak English (except Massimo); car parking is 15-20\u20ac day (depends on your car size) and you have to leave the car key to a person in the basement (and the person also doesn't speak English)","14795":"Very nice B&B located in the very center of Catania - the Duomo and Via Etnea are just around a corner. Lovely terrace with a view of the square nearby. Everything very new and clean. Perfect choice for a short stay in Catania.","14797":"The accommodation was the best where I have ever been to. The B&B is in a beautifully renovated apartment, everything is brand new. Our room was huge, where we were provided with great, big, comfortable beds, with fresh water and juice in the mini-fridge, and with the possibility to make same tee or coffee in the room. The room had two balconies. The bathroom is modern, daily-cleaned. The breakfast is given in a small, cozy room prepared by the lovely host Emanuel or Amanda themselves. The breakfast is great, with a wide variety of fresh bakery products, juices, freshly made coffee, fruits, etc.  We are a family with serious food intolerances. However, Emanuel and Amanda paid serious attention to our needs, and we were given the appropriate food. I forget my scarf in our room and Emanuel sent me by post immediately. We are very thankful to the staff of the B&B, thank you! I can highly recommend the accommodation.","14805":"We really loved this place! The lovely Veronica gave us an upgrade to a superior room as soon as we arrived which was a wonderful surprise and a generous offer. The room was enormous, spotlessly clean, newly renovated...just perfect! And great value for money too. The customer service and attention to detail here is wonderful, and we were given a delicious and filling breakfast which was the best we have had in Italy! Eggs, home made traditional cakes, fresh fruit, hams and cheese etc etc.. ...really great! It was a truly lovely experience and we will definitely return here next time we visit & will recommend it to all our friends. Thank you to Veronica and your lovely mother for your wonderful hospitality. Ps:an added bonus is that the airport bus drops you off directly in front of the building..it could not have been more convenient!!..It's a nice area and very safe too","14809":"What we liked the most was warm welcome and very helpful polite staff. The room was really clean and we didn't need to worry about anything. Every morning we woke up looking at the astonishing ceiling with ornaments. Breakfasts were delicious with fresh orange juice, tasty coffee and croissants for the desert. The apartment is located close to the old town and main street with various shops, cafes and restaurants. It was a very nice stay!","14823":"Located in a not too elegant corner of Palermo, the Albergo Athenaeum was according to expectations, especially for a visitor who had business with the university and stayed there for a couple of nights. Room and service (with the exception of an elevator problem that was solved relatively quickly.) as well as price were in harmony, so that a hotel that can be recommended without any special remarks.","14824":"Lovely place to stop for a couple of days & visit Catane. Amazing room with baroque ceiling 5 m high!. Clean, spacious, we have our own terrace. Nice breakfast fruit, yoghurt,cold meats, eggs & croissants included in the price. It is on the Piazza Trento which is a stop on the Alibus line ( goes round the town and to the airport) Altogether a lovely surprise.","14830":"This is a nice inexpensive hotel near the university, and near many of the tourist attractions. It is not on a main street, so it is a bit more quiet. The rooms were moderately large, and the breakfast was better than average. The staff people were helpful and informative. I would definitely stay here again.","14833":"I had great stay. Everything is treated in detail and the customer service is impeccable. The place is located near everything you need in central point, just in 5 minutes walking from the famous Etnea Road. I recommend it sincerely.","14834":"Yes the hotel is situated in a typical side street of an Italian city. Expect the neighbors to have washing hanging from the line. It offers all the comforts, sizable rooms with balconies, fast internet and free parking. Where it lost the fourth star is that the breakfast room on Sunday morning had no clean tables and everything had to be re-brought. No cheese. No bowls for fruit. The air conditioner didn\u2019t work either. Otherwise centrally situated.","14850":"Being half-Sicilian I\u2019m always going to be biased about this place. Despite coming here as a child every summer and more recently twice in close succession, this is actually my first visit to Sicily\u2019s capital.  This is the start of a nine day holiday to the island that commenced with two days in Palermo. Travelling with my parents in law, my wife and eight year old son, we collected our Fiat 500 (L - this big one) and set off for our Mediterranean Adventure.  The plan is to circle the island counter-clockwise taking in Trapani, Marsala, Sciacca, Agrigento, Syracuse, Taormina and Cefalu. We are going to the sites, little ports, temples, theatres, mosaics and sample as much food as our bodies will allow!  Back to the hotel for a second, it is easy to find from the airport, there is a large underground car park (which is great because you almost certainly risk your Insurnace excess parking on the street)... Palermo could be translated to Dented-Panel-City!!! The hotel itself is then walking distance to the northern quarter and roughly 15 20 minutes from the Ballaro Markets.  The hotel is perfect, large rooms with balconies, adequate bathrooms with a great shower. You\u2019re provided with an abundance of towels everyday! The beds are comfy and the air con is effective, quiet and simple to use.  Fallen in love with the staff here - Pipo and \u201cLorri\u201d in particular have made our stay really special. Our son is not fussy about food but like most eight year olds does prefer chips or penne with a ragu and Parmesan to anything else - and there was never an issue asking for these even if off the menu. Nothing was too much bother and the service is excellent. The food is superb, a simple four courses with three options per course. We\u2019ve enjoyed a tomato and fresh ricotta salad, farfalle pasta with salmon, chicken escalope, spaghetti with olive oil and chilli, local fish, Saltimboca and all this washes down beautifully with local red wine. Five of us eating, four courses including a pudding to die for was 60\u20ac...bargain!  Breakfast is equally simple and sublime with a vast array of cakes and pastries - our son enjoyed the donuts with nutella (so did I in fact).  Referring back to my title of six lanes into one, I was referring of course to the driving style... I\u2019m still not sure how many lanes are in one road, at one point I\u2019m sure there were six lanes of cars and busses meandering round parked cars and scooters whilst avoiding a woman arguing with her partner on the side of a motorway junction (pulled over as you do). It is bonkers. However just go with it, push out with conviction and spot the tourists - we are easy to spot as the only ones using indicators. Rear view mirrors are really there as target practise for scooters   just assume there is always a scooter or car on your backside and you can\u2019t go wrong. It was brilliant, chaotic and yet somehow refreshing to just go where you want, when you want and how you want - I think my father in law got it when we had to move over in the path to allow an impatient Vespa rider avoiding traffic caused by a bin lorry by riding down the side walk!!! Hilarious!!  Anyone who has recently seen Jamie Oliver\u2019s Italy show will know that Sicily is famous for its location in history as a spice merchants trade post. The desserts here are famous as a consequence of Millenia of Arab, Roman, Norman and Greek ownership. The markets are full of this unique history with spices, fruits and veg from pomegranate to peppers, vanilla to vermicelli. It\u2019s all here... six cultures and histories into one three sided island. Just lovely :blush:  Lastly, bit of advice, always carry some cash and change on you, there are so many stall holders with fresh prickly pears \u201cFigo D\u2019india\u201d (literally figs of India) that they lovingly cut the needle covered skins three ways - top, bottom and down the middle to reveal a stunningly refreshing pink or yellow fruit   a must do.  We leave Palermo today for the coastal road to Marsala Via Trapani so will post again later. Ciao for now","14852":"We drove into Palermo from Cefalu and wondered where on earth we were heading to this hotel. It looks like a somewhat dodgy neighbourhood so we were glad of their secure underground parking. A lift to the reception would have been nicer than 2 flights of stairs too..... Room was functional, bed comfortable except for bouncy pillows, shower good, loo NOISY! Also the hotel is incredibly noisy, or rather the guest noise filters through the walls, people talking, people coming in late at night slamming doors and having loud conversations.... Hotel is fairly practically located about 15 minutes from the beginning of the old part of town. You have to negotiate a few busy roads, and beware, zebra crossings mean NOTHING to Italians! Breakfast was pretty poor, if you don't get down early enough they run out of everything, and restocking doesn't seem to be high on their list of jobs. Attitude of restaurant staff was pretty poor. One guy at the front desk was incredibly helpful on our first day there which was great. Would we stay here again - no. Would we go back to palermo - no!","14857":"The hotel is at a 15 minutes walk from the city center. The reception staff was very friendly. The negative aspects of my visit: the toiletries consist of a very poor quality liquid for hair, hand and body wash, the cleaning staff is very noisy so you cannot sleep past 8:30 am and the breakfast is not very varied if you don't like to eat pastries. Also, I reserved a room with two single beds and received one with a double bed.","14858":"Barely 1 step up from a hostel. Positives: breakfast included. Front desk staff helpful. Negatives: shower wouldn't drain, toilet wouldn't flush, the bed is hard as a rock, paper thin walls and blankets, and it's in the ghetto of Palermo. Trash everywhere. I've traveled throughout Europe and this is the 2nd worst hotel I've ever stayed at in my life.","14861":"Friendly English speaking staff, the room was lovely and spacious and we were on the third floor so our view was really nice. Fresh towels and bottled water stocked up in the fridge every day which was an added bonus! The shower was lovely! Air con was fully working and well needed on some of the hot days! Breakfast was pastries, toast, meats, cheeses, boiled eggs. Coffee was good and there was fresh juice every day. Safe key was free of charge - just ask at reception. Walking distance to main bars and town about 20mins or if you ask the reception to get you a taxi and drop off at the port it\u2019s about \u20ac15-20 Some lovely bars around the port!  Really recommend this hotel!!","14869":"Even though our flight was delayed by 1.5hrs, it was not a problem to check in late evening. We kept in touch with the hotel with our progress and were warmly welcomed into the hotel. We were shown our room and where breakfast would be served. We were given a map of Catania and shown ideas of where to visit and where to eat. Our room was the Plaza room and was lovely and spacious, spotlessly clean, comfy bed and a nice view across the street, other than some traffic noise during rush hour it was very quiet at night. There were tea  coffee making facilities in the room, a small fridge, Tv, and a lovely power shower and toiletries.  Breakfast is served in either the garden room or you can sit outside, the ladies offer cooked eggs, and bring a plate of tomatoes, cheese and salami as well as a hot pastries. There is plenty of tea or coffee, juice, fresh fruit, cereals, yogurts. Sicilian cakes, fresh bread and a toaster and anything else you need. Delicious and filing.  The hotel is just across the road from the Airport bus stop at Trento and is located just 10 mins walk in the main areas for sightseeing. Plenty of restaurants, cafes and shops nearby, and easy 20min walk to the train or bus stations. There is a small supermarket just behind the hotel and a parking garage.  Overall we felt very welcomed into the hotel by all the staff as if it was their home. We spent 3 nights there and loved it. Thank you Veronica for the warm welcome and best wishes for the future.","14871":"This hotel may be so called central - but its tired, tiny and basic. If you step out of the shower not concentrating you will be in the bidet! Its a good walk to central town and sites. We were on the 5th floor - so it was quiet. However we only had one bath towel and had to call for another and the room was just OK. Breakfast had a selection but was not exciting - enough but not wow!","14872":"Large room but not as large as others in this B&B, however the Garden Room comes with its own private terrace which is a nice spot to read or have a pre dinner \u201creinforced\u201d cocktail. Very pleasant staff and great breakfast. Location is an easy walk to the old city and the lovely park on the hill. Wayne M Ottawa, Canada","14874":"Nice place, huge rooms with decorated ceiling. Breakfast is good with pastries, cherry tomatoes, cheese and salami, blood orange juice, tea, coffee and everything needed. Veronica gave is lots of advices for visits and place where we could find restaurants. Everything written on a map. City center accessible by foot. Great experience!","14875":"We had the warmest welcome on arrival at this BnB. They couldn't have been nicer or more helpful. We were taken to our room which was right opposite Reception and overlooking the Square in front of the hotel. It was large and well appointed. We only had the one night and part of a day in Catania before we headed South, but during that time we were well positioned to walk around the city, and most importantly to get to the iconic Fish Market. Breakfast was more than adequate. Veronica and her Mom are lovely people who really care about their guests and this is what made our short stay most memorable.","14876":"I selected this hotel because it was close to the university, where a conference took place. I had to stay for seven nights, so my review is based on a relatively long period of observation.  First of all, the hotel is about 3 km roundtrip walking distance from the city center. The hotel is located in a neighborhood that has filthy streets and trash lying around. Walking to the city center felt very unpleasant because of the trash and the traffic. It also did not feel safe. The reception on the first day was not too bad. English of the reception staff was OK, although it was sometimes hard to communicate. My room was on the 6th floor facing the street next to the hotel with many residential apartments. Especially in the morning street noise and chatter from these apartments could be heard when I slept with the balcony door open. The room was spacious, the bathroom was not bad. The bed was surprisingly comfortable. However, noise from neighboring rooms could be heard too much. Room service changed towels frequently but bed sheets only once during my 7-night stay. Breakfast appears to be diverse however in fact almost everything was sweet pastries. The only non-sweet food item was one sort of cheese and one sort of cold-cut meat. Service staff in the dining room can barely speak English and are not attentive when the room gets a little more crowded than usual. I have also experienced that they can be very rude towards guests. In general, I doubt that the hotel knows the notion of showing hospitality.  I do not recommend this hotel for long stays. It may be acceptable if you are on a budget but as a better alternative, it may be worthwhile to try a B&B style accommodation in Palermo.","14879":"I arrived to the hotel on a Sunday and the welcome was pretty okay. I chose this hotel because it was conveniently located next to the university. However, the hotel is far from the center and train station and it requires a bit of a walk.. Breakfast was okay, but not everything felt fresh. The shower was very small. The neighborhood it\u2019s located in is dirty..  All in all, the hotel is okay if you\u2019re on a budget.","14892":"We stayed there for three nights. Please inform b&b about tour checkin time a day before as they are not available there all the time. If you are coming by ferry or flight airport bus \u2018ALIBUS\u2019 drops you in front of b&b. Veronika was super helpful on explaining things and shared all what we needed to see catania and how to do our trips to other cities by bus. She even printed us bus time tables. Her mom was super generous at every breakfast and they offer good variety in breakfast. Rooms were super-big and super clean. A real king size bed in rooms which was a delight too.  5 5 and certainly recommended.","14893":"We had a 2-night stay here in July 2018.  + It is about 20-30 min walk to the center of Catania and the surrounding is generally more quiet than not. + Room: The usual amenities were provided. Good WiFi and air conditioning. Room was spacious enough but we had more space in the adjacent room and wished we had more space in the same bedroom. It was clean enough. + Breakfast: Typical Italian sweet breakfast. They made us scrambled eggs which was nice.  - Facilities: No free parking space, unfortunately and it was hard to find any space on the streets. But at night time, there were spaces right in front of the B&B.  - The worst part could be that it tended to be rather noisy. All the noise from the corridors and the kitchen came through to our room. So especially in the morning, when they were preparing breakfast, the noise woke us up. Also, the person managing the place in the morning is really really nice person but spoke so loud with the guests so her voice echoed to our rooms. It would be good to bring ear plugs if noise tend to bother your sleep.","14900":"It was a treat for us to stay in B&B Liberty 900. We stayed in the Garden room which is spacious and comfortable with a very clean bathroom. We had a delicious breakfast served on the roof-top garden. Veronica speaks good English and is very friendly and helpful, she went out of her way to help us confirm other travel bookings which was very much appreciated. Highly recommended.","14908":"We had a great experience in this b&b. Really helpful staff, great and abandoned breakfast also a very central location. I will definelty go again and I will highly recommend it! Well done to the owners and their staff.  Ms Bonnici.","14915":"I visited the place with my parents and the experience from 0 to 10 was just a 20.  The place is run by a lovely family that treated us like family, taking care of every detail and need.  Rooms are beautiful, palace-ish with incredible ceiling. The breakfast is amazing, directed by the mamma (tried to teach some Italian to my mom with no success) with care and love.  Don't miss their daughter Veronica,full of knowledge and advice.She has the key to discover all the hidden treasures of Catania,she did help us to end loving Catania as much as they do.  I just cannot say more. This is the place to stay in Catania.","14932":"We stayed here for three nights and were a bit worried when we saw the outside, it was a bit scruffy and on entering the main door, we had to go up two flights of stairs and the area in there was being renovated so it didn't look great. However, on opening the door to the actual b&b, it was beautiful; a little oasis of calm!  Nice welcome from Manuela and we were given lots of information and a map of Catania. Our room was really stunning, beautifully decorated with the original ceilings and it was huge! It had three small balconies, two with a view of the castle which was at the end of the street.  It was spotlessly clean, very light and sunny and really nicely furnished. It had quite a large entrance area with dressing table, a very modern bathroom and then the huge bedroom with a good size sitting area and sofa as well - we were very impressed!  There was tea, coffee and water available 24 7 in the lounge, which we thought was a lovely touch too.  It is very centrally located, just 5 minutes walk to the Pizza Duomo and Via Etnea and lots of bars and restaurants.  The only thing we weren't keen on was the breakfast, as were squashed in at a communal table which we personally found a little uncomfortable. There wasn't a great deal of choice either, mainly sweet pastries but they were tasty and the coffee was good!! I believe this is the traditional Sicilian breakfast anyway!  All in all, we had a great stay and it really is a beautiful B&B in the heart of Catania.","14936":"This hotel is a charming old villa in the center of Catania's old district. It is within walking distance to the historical sites. The room was huge, beautiful and comfortable. It was quiet. The breakfast was excellent and the service superb. The only downside is that it is a distance from the airport and you have to climb some steep stairs with your luggage. I recommend this hotel if you are interested in visiting Old Town Catania.","14940":"We spent a few nights here and found the location quite good, just a 5-10 minute walk from the main piazza (Piazza Duomo) and fish market area. The room was relatively clean and beautifully decorated. Breakfast was predominately sweet (typical for the area) but very fresh and well presented. The B&B is located on a busy street so if you're sensitive to city noise (cars, scooters, loud talking on the street) you might need to bring some earplugs or ask for their quietest room. It was also quite noisy in the room from neighbouring apartments well after midnight. There's no breakfast on Sunday, you need to walk to Prestipino on Piazza Duomo to use a coupon which entitles you to one of three options although we were told we could only choose between two of the options at the counter.","14945":"A sweet little bed and breakfast located perfectly by all the sites. The woman who checked us in was very helpful with a map already marked up and spoke excellent English. The music room is very large and bright with a terrace large enough for 2 chairs. The bed was very comfortable. We didn\u2019t have the opportunity to have breakfast because we had to catch an early flight, but I\u2019d definitely stay here again. Coffee, tea, snacks and bottled water are available 24 7. Most incredibly, the woman (wish I knew her name!) rushed after us at 7 in the morning all the way to the airport because she realized we\u2019d already paid for the room and came to give us our cash back. I was shocked to see her there. What amazing honesty and service!!","14954":"This place is superb. Perfectly located for visiting catania by foot but there is also free parking in the area. The rooms are beautiful and clean. Breakfast is super with fresh pastries and cakes. Staff is super friendly and helpful. Great suggestions for restaurants. Thanks","14955":"Only it's location worth it! After that the chaos!!! I don't know how to start. Beds were broken, so the owner kept the outside as a decor and is using a platform inside for the strom. But this makes it very noisy. We asked for a blanket and they brought us a piece of GFB without even a cover. The shutter broke after a couple of days and we couldn't open it and close it. And here comes the best. We'd charged 10 euros per day for housekeeping and heating, but this wasn't clear when we did the reservation. The answer was we send you an email the day before your arrival!!! I can keep writing but I don't want to spend more time for this crup...","14963":"We had five nights here on honeymoon and really enjoyed it. The hotel is centrally located, less than half a mile from the main city piazza, and within spitting distance of the Castello Ursino - we even had a view of it from our Balcony. There are numerous excellent restaurants within a minute or two on foot.  The owner was very friendly and helpful and pointed out lots of things to do and see locally, and can also book tours, taxis and travel for you.  The standard of the room was very high with beautiful ceilings, furniture etc. Our room had three balconies on two sides of the room, with views of both the castle and a little bit of Mount Etna in the opposite direction. The room and building was spotlessly clean throughout. There is a communal area with a fridge and kitchen area if you need it.  Breakfast was provided each morning in the communal dining area - there was a selection of pastries, cereal, fruit and toast, with fruit juice, tea and coffee to drink.  In conclusion this was a great place to stay and highly enjoyable. Catania is a very interesting city as well, and makes a great base for visiting Etna and other locations in Sicily. Highly recommended.","14967":"This B & B was perfect and provided us with a great location in Catania. Or hostess made us feel welcome from the moment we arrived. We didn't want to leave! The rooms are beautifully decorated. We loved our stay here.","14970":"I can not even say enough how over the top fantastic this bed and breakfast was. I wish there was 10 stars because it exceeds 5 stars by a lot!!! I had expected it to be in a great location and a really nice modern place but what I wasn\u2019t expecting was all the other extras. From the minute you walked in the atmosphere was beauty. It even smelled wonderful. The decorating was so gorgeous and all the original details were something I have never seen before. The ceiling in our room was incredible. The beds were very comfortable and the whole place was immaculately clean. The hosts were so loving and kind and helped us with everything from making reservations, calling us taxis or giving us a map of the area. The breakfast was so good with all the traditions of Sicily. We left with such an incredibly positive feeling. I actually felt sad to say good bye to the hosts. I will definitely be back!! It was a great experience!!","14972":"Don't be put off by the facade and look up when arriving. This hyper modern B&B within 5 minutes of the Duomo. Beautiful airconditioned rooms, super quiet at night. Breakfast is typical Sicilians - sweet but who counts calories while on holidays. Pass the word A GREAT PLACE.","14978":"Lovely place. Both of the two young female staff proprietors we met were very helpful and friendly. Bedroom had loads of character with decorated ceilings and interesting furnishings. Breakfasts were relatively simple, but absolutely fine. And good value too. We'd happily stay here again if we returned to Catania","14983":"My wife and I stayed here for 4 nights and it was 1st class ... thank you too the 2 sisters who helped us out with the car parking on our first night Very friendly and helpfull accomadation is superb spotless ... we will definitely rebook on our next trip to Sicily","14988":"Our expectatios have been more than met: the B&B is located in an old palazzo. Its original stukko ceilings are something special. We loved the combination of the old with a modern interior decoration. Everything was clean, the room spacious, the host very kind and helpful. Moreover, the B&B is in the heart of the old part of Catania. The market and the major sights as well as many restaurants and apero-bars can easily be reached by foot. Parking is possible free of charge along the roads, with some luck right in front of the house.","14996":"The entire area of the B&B was beautifully decorated, clean, and very well maintained. The hostess, Manuela, was always so helpful. She would go out of her way to help with whatever was needed. It was convenient to several local restaurants. The walk to the main area of the city was easy and 5 minutes away.","14997":"Thanks to the kind hospitality of Manuela we got all the information we needed to visit the region. Good breakfast. The rooms are completely renewed. Nice neighborhood in a very, very quite street. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014","15002":"Lovely warm welcome with lots of helpful information from Manuela which we much appreciated. Clean and well located. However disappointed to find the room we booked was occupied and we had to make do with a much smaller and less beautiful one. We were given a small discount for to this. Also, whilst we were very understanding that Manuela had an appointment the next day that meant she couldn't serve us breakfast, we were sad to find the bar where we were asked to go instead could only provide us with a coffee and sugary pastry.That all said we were pleased to be allowed a late check out at no extra fee. So a mixed experience. If we had had the room we booked and the breakfast as it is shown on the site I am sure we would rate this a excellent.","15007":"This is very nice B&B in 2 minutes walk from Catania duomo and close to wonderful fishmarket that is must to see. The accommodation is nice, very clean and very new. The rooms are big, clean, good equipped and has balcony. The breakfast is good, typical Italian with a lot of sweets especially croasans. All the time you can take free water and free espresso (also decaffeinated one). We really can recommend this property to anyone who would like to visit Catania.","15013":"Antadia is one of those places you want to return to. Rooms are very spacious with high ceilings and ours had a small terrace. Bathroom was very big and every day towels were changed. We stayed for 8 nights and every morning we had different freshly baked home made cakes for breakfast delivered. Excellent cakes we did enjoy them so much. The first thing we would do in the morning was to check what cakes were served. There was also a coffee machine and a selection of breakfast food in the fridge. We were impressed with the cleanliness of the place. Every day we saw it thoroughly cleaned, so no wonder it was spotless at all times. Location is excellent, located right in the center of the town in the peaceful street. Within the walking distance to the train station, tram, the old town it is really a fantastic place to stay.If you are flying I would recommend you to ask the owners to collect you at the airport. For a reasonable price the owner will wait for you at the airport, help you with the suitcase and during the drive give you all information you need. We certainly enjoyed our stay in Antadia and hospitality of the owners. Regarding the price we got far more than we paid for. If we return to Palermo we will certainly stay in Antadia.","15021":"Couldn't be more happy than picking B&B il Leone Blu as start of our Sicily holiday. Wonderful rooms, tastfully decorated, great bathroom. Probably one of the best B&B's in Europe. The price is realy very modest if you compare with what you're getting, it's a great deal! B&B is centrally located in wonderful Catania, she recommended and booked some great Italian restaurants within 2 minutes walk. If you want to start or finish your Sicily holiday just book B&B Il Leone Blu, you will not regret it. All my thanks to the host Manuela, you are a wonderful host and person and many thanks for all your help!!","15081":"The location is perfect to visit Catania very close to all the turistic attractions and to bars and restaurants. Rooms are very nice and well equipped and the service is excellent! Absolutely reccomended!","15087":"OK, let me start by saying that My friend and I were supposed to go to another hotel within the area which I did, but it turned out to be very old, dirty and just one big mess. I decided I could not to stay there so at the last minute I was looking for a hotel, bed-and-breakfast or anywhere that was clean and professional for us. Fortunately, through some miracle contacting places, I found Antonella. We told her the situation and she was more than happy to help. She came late in the evening to greet us and make sure that we were situated very well. We got into the room and it was absolutely beautiful, clean and very comfortable. Antonella treated me and my friend like we were family she would check up on us to make sure we were OK, see if we needed anything and she provided many recommendations-she was just a delight to be around. Breakfast in the morning was delicious and she always had fresh fruit available (if you needed a little snack). Everything about this place was wonderful the location, the room, the hostess, the breakfast ...everything from start to finish was excellent I highly recommend this bed-and-breakfast. When I return to Palermo, this will definitely be the place I stay!! And honestly, Antonella is amazing you will love her!","15088":"One immediate plus was that the taxi driver at the airport knew exactly where it was, always a good start. Check-in was painless although as we arrived on a Sunday, and being a B&B with minimal staff on duty, not all of the facilities were obvious or pointed out. The accommodation was clean and well appointed and the air conditioning was very efficient. Breakfast was more than adequate with a full range of cold cuts juices, cereals and fresh fruit available with a courteous and helpful lady on duty. One small drawback is that although the rooms we occupied were well insulated from traffic noise, noise from the reception area, which includes vending machines, was at times intrusive. I would certainly go there again if visiting Sicily.","15091":"Lovely little B&B near centre of Catania. Really helpful owner and loads of good restaurants & bars nearby. Only about 10 - 15 minutes to centre. Room well equipped and comfortable. Would stay again :-)","15102":"We arrived on August 28 in the evening at the LOrlando Furioso and the receptionist did not understand or speak English. We received room no. 2, which was apparently all clean and nice. We received a bottle of water and we sat on the bed. There was a double bed and two smaller beds, we travelled with our 10 year old son. My son noticed a brown insect going pretty fast on the white sheet of our bed. He crushed it with a napkin and it splashed red blood all over. We didn't know what it was, we were kind of tired after a 4 hour drive and we just wanted to go to sleep. We used the shower which was ok, there were clean towels and little soap bars. Whan we sat on the bed we saw 4 more insects and when looked it up on the internet we realised they were bed bugs. Blood eating insects living in the mattress and wooden parts of the bed. We called the person who had confirmed our reservations and until her response 2 hours later we caught 20 more bed bugs which kept coming from all the beds. We were so tired and scared but finally the lady came, she seemed stupefied with the situation and offered us a free stay at a nearby hotel. The bedbugs had been there for some time and it was not something that appeared on the spot. I took some pictures of the bugs but they moved so fast.","15106":"Lovely, clean bright and airy rooms with high ceilings. Lovely helpful staff that gave clean answers to all queries. Great location close to main attractions. There was plenty of breakfast and it was fine for starting the day. I would stay here again.","15110":"This is a great place to stay in Catania. Very central, rooms are very clean, breakfast is good. Staff is helpful and they speak English. The room for 4 people is very big and nice. Not a bad word to say. Thanks!","15112":"We stayed in this lovely bed and breakfast for one night but we definitely wish we had stayed longer. The place is extremely cleand and the breakfast is simply delicious. It's location is perfect and are only a minute away from the historical centre. The kind staff even found us a parking space. I highly recommend it to anyone visiting as a family or a couple. We had two rooms, one of which had 2 single beds and a double and a second with a double room. They adapt to your needs and when you are there you feel at home.","15113":"Truly disappointed, this B&B deserves my lowest rating.  1. WRONG ADDRESS IN HOTELS.COM - Receptionist blaming Google for the mistake (address is correct in TripAdvisor and Bookings). This MANAGEMENT mistake costed me time and good temper! 2. AIR CONDITIONING INSUFFICIENT - Stand-alone unit INSIDE the room truly NOISY. Must be turned off for sleeping. 3. MINI-WINDOW to the school play yard=Sweet dreams! 4. NO BREAKFAST INCLUDED- I did not see any, nor was told so. Had to go to the caf\u00e9 downstairs.  However, to be fair, this place also has its assets: A. BEST LOCATION IN TOWN B. SPACIOUS ROOMS C. BRAND NEW BATHROOM","15134":"We spent 7 nights in 8 Mood - and are very happy. We booked a family room with a double bed and an additional bed for our son. There would have been a 4th sleeping option on a very comfortable leather sofa. What is very important to us is a comfortable bed - not too soft especially. And we were sleeping very well. The room was big enough for the 3 of us. A small desk and chair as well as a cabinet to store our stuff. For summer the room also offered an air conditioning. A small balcony with window towards the street - a big noisy tough if you open the window. The bathroom was well equipped and almost new; and do was the room as well. The breakfast was incl and we found all we need. Cereals, several cakes, fresh buns, marmelade, honey, Nutella, cold cuts and cheese. Fresh squeezed orange juice on request. Only the coffee was not great but okay. The B&B offered free internet - not the fastest but working well.  The service and friendliness was outstanding.  For parking we booked a close by (3min by foot) locked garage.  There was a vending machine as well so you could buy some drinks, sweets and snacks - all at very reasonable price !  The B&B is located only a few walking minutes from city centre - so a perfect location close to all main tourist attractions. Beside the B&B a small Cafe and a super good bakery opposite side of the street. Owners are just amazing ! Try their pizza snacks, home made Grissini and buns !!  All in all a great stay ! Thank you very much !!","15141":"It was great place to stay in Catania, as the location of the 88mood B&B was very central and close to the best arancini place as well as the main street of the city center. Room was beautiful and clean, breakfast was really nice. Staff was friendly, kind and helpful. It was great to be there.","15148":"I stayed at 88mood B&B for two nights and I can highly recommend this place who visits the beautiful city of catania Sicily.The staff are very friendly and very helpful especially the lady called Ribella who explained and told us all the places to visit in and around catania along with how to get there ECT. 88mood is a beautiful modern B&B hostal right in the centre of catania with great views of the city with local transport near by along with easy access to travell in and out of the city.The rooms are very modern, clean, and tidy with a shower which is to die for and I couldn't wait to get back to my room to shower it was just amazing.The breakfast was just lush with alot to choose from starting with the juices,teas,coffees,pastries,fruits,along with the selection of Italian meats and lots more.I will deffentley be returning to the beautiful city of catania and I will defentley be staying at 88mood. Ribella grazie mille e alla prossima.","15150":"The B&B is located in the center of Catania. We arrived by car, so it was necessary for us to ask for a safe place o park. We could rent a garage 5 minutes away which was super comfortable.  The people at the b&b were super friendly, polite and helpful, and we could fortunately speak English The room was clean und for breakfast we had an unexpected wide range of different ddishes (fruit, cakes, cereals)  We recommend this lovely B&B.","15167":"Great views, great place, friendly staff, clean, best shower I\u2019ve ever used, great breakfast selections with a great juice selection, cappuccinos, and espresso. Very helpful staff. Late check in was easy even though there were no staff at the front desk. Happy with our stay","15177":"Lovely hotel close to city centre. Wonderful breakfast. Very comfortable room. Very helpful staff and very helpful owner. We will surely return to this hotel me and all my family. I will recommend to everyone.","15182":"Our host Pietro, made us feel like family. The rooms were spacious bright and clean. He took care every morning to prepare a lovely breakfast spread, and made our cappuccinos himself. He had wonderful suggestions about what to visit and where to eat. I would stay here again next time I visit. Couldnt ask for better","15186":"I would highly recommend this B&B, breakfast, rooms and facilities are excellent, the location is in the centre of Catania, walking distance from all the main attractions . Ribella and her staff a super friendly ! I would definitely stay here again . Thank you again .","15200":"Two days before the shut the entire country down and cancelled our flights the hotel told us they had a \u2018special rate\u2019 for us that had to be \u2018paid in full and was non refundable\u2019. We\u2019re so sorry for the Italian people during this crisis and every hotel has kindly refunded us except habitat. They are keeping our money because of the \u2018special rate\u2019 and cancellations policy. Very poor customer service. They\u2019re allowing us to visit another time but this is just not good enough.","15210":"Split between two buildings at the same address, this hotel is quite quirky. The reception and breakfast room are in one building accessed from a shared courtyard. However, the majority of the rooms are on the renovated upper floors of the main building. All the rooms are very pleasantly modern and elegant. The negative point for the rooms is the smart home electronics for controlling the windows, blinds, heating, lighting, etc. At first, we had problems opening the Velux windows. It would be helpful if the hotel would provide clear instructions for people who are unfamiliar with this technology. The bed was comfortable, and the room was quiet. The highlight of this hotel was the extensive breakfast buffet, which was the best we had on our vacation in Sicily. There is a vast selection of savory and sweet items, mostly organic. A big plus was the abundance of fresh seasonal fruits, from freshly cut fruit to deliciously fresh-squeezed juices and smoothies.","15233":"We picked this hotel after reading about it on Trip Advisor. We were doing a two week road trip around Sicily and wanted to find a hotel where the 4 of us could say. As we were driving in from a great day hiking on Mt. Etna, for whatever reason, finding this hotel was a real pain for us. We were using google maps which actually guided us onto Via Vittorio Emanuele for whatever reason. After driving around for about 20 min (and getting separated from the other car that was with us which was very stressful), we finally figured out to pull into the street piazza where a school was getting out and drive down where there is a small sign on the wall near a bar. On our check in, the reception person was not very sympathetic when we told him our plight. I ended up driving down some locals only streets which means I may be seeing a ticket from the Catania police in a few months if they review the video.  Once we unloaded our bags and figured things out, the parking was pretty decent (in a secure garage maybe 300-400 meters away). Our rooms were spacious for Italy or even for the US. Breakfast was very good. We had a big shower that had good water but didn't drain 100% perfectly. Our room was pretty quiet but my mother-in-laws room was a bit louder at night as there are bars nearby. Her room also required a climb up a staircase after taking an elevator which would obviously not work for people with physical issues. Internet was adequate. The other staff that we encountered there were more friendly than the initial gentleman that we encountered.  So would we stay here again- probably now that we know where it is! I'd highly recommend the hotel give people more specific instructions of how to get there when they make their reservation. The location is pretty central to Catania and wasn't far from both the Fish Market area and Bellini Park (where we went to a Gelato festival!)","15252":"The localisation is very interresting for visit th\u00e9 nice Town but Sleeping is not possible because the noise during the night ! The room was clean and the breakfast wicth quality prodiges. If you Dany to sleep during the night, chose an another h\u00f4tel !","15254":"We thoroughly enjoyed our recent stay, we agree with all the other guests comments - big rooms, a bit style over substance, no tea coffee, noisy and not insulated, shower could be warmer, however, that said it was lovely and I\u2019d stay there again without question. The breakfast alone made it worthwhile and the friendly, helpful staff. As a regular traveller in the UK, staying in premier inns and travelodges this was just the antidote I needed - it had personality!","15262":"Habitat is in a great location. There are many good restaurants and bars nearby and it is an easy walk to the centre and the bus and railway station. The staff were very helpful and the breakfast buffet was good. However, there are some important issues with the room. (We were in one of the modern rooms in the new part). The first one being there is not a wardrobe or any drawers cupboards at all. We were here for a week and lived out of our suitcase. I do not like doing this and have travelled all over the world and never stayed anywhere where you can't unpack and put your clothes away. There is a hanging rail in one corner of the room but this is only suitable for mens shirts or short items as there is a shelf underneath. The room was a good size so I have absolutely no idea why this is so. The other thing I didn't like was that the shower was in the main bedroom so you had to watch your partner in the shower. The toilet had a glass door (frosted glass admittedly) but you could still see through it. The whole bathroom layout was terrible. There were no towel hooks next to the sink and hardly any space to put toiletries. The phrase 'style over substance' comes to mind. We did not have any noise issues as others have mentioned. There are velux windows in the ceiling which let in lots of light but no other windows so you cannot look out over the streets and rooftops which I think is always fascinating when staying in Italy.","15270":"A modern sophisticated place. My room was on the top floor, no windows to see something, only windows were in the ceiling. Excellent location, can walk to the center, as well to the train station. Free fast internet. Free breakfast was very good. There were few issues important to me. 1. Not even a single english channel on TV. 2. No refrigerator in the room. 3. No glasses in the room (I went to the reception and they got me one). Would give it 3 points, but giving 4 because I payed not too much for it.","15280":"Loved our stay here. We were welcomed by Luigi and he is super fantastic, gave us great information and tips for Palermo. We booked a private room so were moved location, which was right in the city centre, we couldnt have asked for better.","15286":"Habitat is an immediate standout for couples like us. It conveys funkiness with elegance, minimalism with warmth, service with overattention, convenience of location without crowding. All at a solid but reasonable price, and lots of plants :) The location, set behind an access doorway and ancient passage, just near the glorious Teatro Massimo Bellini is simply wonderful and easy to get to.  In the large reception and dining areas, the restored interior (of the exposed beams kind) makes attractive use of wall space using plants and coloured bottles. Our room, with bathroom, looked spacious and comfortable.  Habitat is a relative newcomer but it's already showing signs of wear and a low-cost approach to fittings. Tiles and glasswear in the bathroom are getting scungy. Our door handle came off - a safety concern. Practicality seems to have been sacrificed for mimimalism, so there's little storage space, especially in the bathroom.  Sound proofing also seems to have been overlooked. Every sound between rooms can be heard - interrupting sleep early in the morning late at night. As a result, we gave up our last booked night and stayed elsewhere.  The stairway is uncomfortable to negotiate, with a rather unstable railing on one side and a wall potplants at the bottom curve where a stabilising handrail is needed.  Breakfast is tasty, plentiful and well-serviced, in an attractive, large, well-lit room. The long-table arrangement works well if you're able to chat with your neighbour. Otherwise it feels a bit oppressive, like an old library. Likewise with the seating area with books. It doesn't encourage you to linger. Again - looks over function.  Habitat sits uneasily between 'hotel' and B&B' - not quite one or the other in terms of service and function. So, definitely give it a try, just be mindful of these things. And guests we spoke to are discerning. I would really love to see Habitat going strongly into the future, Habitat is a wonderful concept and has so much going for it. With improvements and adjustments, I'm sure it can do so.","15289":"Very lovely boutique hotel at an extremely convenient location. Located a few steps from Teatro Bellini. Walk towards Teatro Bellini and continue onward to Via Coppola   Piazza Spirito Santo and onwards to Piazza Stesicoro at Via Etnea (the biggest pedestrian street) and you would find many restaurants. Restaurants that were tried and tested and highly recommended in the area included MeCumpari Turiddu, Osteria Panecaldo and Street 54 Trattoria Sicula. We didn\u2019t have a chance but would have loved to try Trattoria Del Cavaliere; the place looked happening at night as well as during Sunday lunch. One can also walk south towards Via Vittorio Emanuelle II and head right (west) towards Piazza Duomo or Piazza delle Universita. All this can be done within 10 minutes.  As of now, there are 17 rooms in the hotel. Go past the front door of the house building and you would find an entrance on the right where they have recently taken over the 3rd and 4th floors of a building to put in 5 rooms per floor. Walk towards the back past the \u201ccourtyard\u201d and you would find the original hotel, with reception and 4 rooms on the ground floor, and the breakfast room and 3 rooms on the 1st floor. There is some construction work going on with other floors buildings sharing the same courtyard; not sure if they may be expanding in future.  We were occupying room 45 on the 4th floor of the building on the right past the front entrance. To get there, you can take the elevator to the 3rd floor but have to take the stairs from 3rd to 4th. The room is very spacious. Interesting enough, there were no windows that opened onto the street; rather there were 2 windows that opened through the tilted roof (which you can control with the buttons) as well as a skylight rooftop window in the bathroom. During the day, there was copious amount of natural light. Like other rooms, the toilet and shower areas are not connected, so feels a bit awkward. And like other rooms, the shower cubicle is very open; the hotel may work best for intimate couples only. Wifi works well in the room.  Did not feel unsafe at all even when walking back to the hotel later in night. Typically hip crowd hanging out at the sports bars and that actually made the scene feel quite secure. Used the key to open the front door and we could quickly go back into the courtyard.  Enjoyed the breakfast in the morning, particularly the juices. Skip the eggs that are presented the first round; they may be left over from the day before (nothing wrong), but they are likely to have been put in the fridge over night so would be quite cold. Wait for the fresh batch of boiled eggs that are prepared. Breakfast is served between 8am and 1030am.  Some comments on the \u201copportunities\u201d that the hotel should look into  - I suspect there may be a plumbing issue hence the bathroom and the shower areas are separate. If the hotel is renovating other parts of the building, perhaps consider putting them side by side. Currently there are no towel hangars in the toilet itself. The \u201cnod\u201d to hang your bath towel in the shower area is not easy to use.  - Noise level \u2013 since we are on the 4th floor and our windows do not face the direction of the street courtyard, we heard NOTHING from outside. The only noise that we heard was when the occupants in room 44 and on 3rd floor were using their showers. Not sure how much insulation there is between the walls. I notice the billiard room that shares the same courtyard and I think that is attached to the bar at 27 Via Teatro Massimo, and I wonder if those who complain about the noise is talking about the billiard room or the 5 bars that open onto Teatro Massimo to the west of the hotel; I can imagine this noise can be distracting at night for those in rooms with windows that open to them.  - There is so much space in the room, yet there is no proper closet. There is a bar with hangars for clothes, but the table length extends to that area so your trousers may be touching the table itself. Perhaps cut down on the length of the table, and instead, build some shelf space at a lower level where one can put t-shirts underwear whatever. Maybe build some proper shelf storage space for luggage.  - Loved the flat screen TV. However, all channels were in Italian. Perhaps subscribe to some non Italian channels (like CNN or BBC World or something like that) so at least guests have \u201csome access to the outside world\u201d.  - There is no telephone in the room. Didn\u2019t bother us as we had a European sim card in our cell phone, but some may find this bothersome as you have to go to Reception to speak with somebody if you need to.  - No water kettle glasses in the room. Again didn\u2019t bother us as we bought bottled water from a store across the street, and we were told to grab glasses from or make tea in the breakfast room if we needed to; but again not very intuitive.  - Highly recommended this hotel if you are going to drive or rent a car. Parking costs EUR20 each night, and the secured garage is at Piazza Lupo. You just walk east on Via Teatro Massimo to get to it, around 200 metres away. What I would recommend is for the hotel to give specific instructions to arriving guests in the hotel web site or when they reply guests who request parking on how to get there, including photos so that people know what to look for. The Map function on our phones showed us where the garage was, but we drove around a couple of times before realizing where the actual garage was. Also, there is a panel buttons on the door to the garage and this is where you can press \u201cReception\u201d to talk to reception and they can open close the garage door for you. When you pick up your rental car from the airport, recommend to directly drive to the garage, park your car, and then walk back to the hotel with the luggage.  - If you rent from Hertz, ignore all signs of car return and what your navigation system tells you. We saw signs of Budget Avis but the entrance to Hertz return is on a different road. The entrance to Hertz return is near the A1 or R1 parking lot. \uf04a But don\u2019t worry, if you get lost, stop and flag down anybody and they would be more than happy to help you, despite the language barrier.  - The hotel is NOT for the mobility challenged. No matter which of the 17 rooms you stay in, you need to walk up and down the stairs every day (at least to from the breakfast room).  Now, I have to say, we loved the hotel, and would be more than happy to stay here again if we ever go back to Catania, but I can imagine that the design of the hotel may not work for everybody.","15291":"It was a bit tiresome that the reception & garage were on the other side of town, but the room was interesting & in a short walking distance to all the main sights - the main square, markets, restaurants, ....","15293":"This place is a little hard to find, but once you do you are glad you chose it. It is so quaint. They are renovating an old building and keeping the original floors and stairs because they are in such good shape. It is very central \u2014 we walked from the train station and walked a few blocks to catch the airport bus. The breakfast is very good and the rooms are amazing! They aware spacious and modern. There are many good restaurants close by and the sights to see are all within walking distance. All the staff are very attentive to all your needs.","15296":"This a very fun, friendly boutique style hotel done very well in contemporary design. We loved the location which was easy walking distance to the bus station and lots of great restaurants and bars. The staff was very helpful and friendly. The morning breakfast was very good.","15297":"I highly recommend habitat B&B for anyone staying in Catania. The buildings are all old and classic Sicilian architecture in the area, but once you enter the building, the rooms are a real surprise, as they are all newly renovated, very stylish modern, high ceilings, cool air conditioning and spacious private bathrooms. The breakfast included is also wonderful with all fresh local produce, juices, fruit , breads.  We have been travelling throughout Europe and Scandinavia for 5 weeks now and this is one of the best places we have stayed. The staff are also most accommodating and very helpful, and have no problems with English speaking customers.","15299":"Great location, very easy walking access to Catania sites. Fantastic service from the reception staff and the guys on breakfast duty (yes the breakfast is good). All very helpful. Hotel is modern (inside), clean and secure. Lively outside at night but that is all part of life in central Catania.","15301":"This is a very nice hotel. The room is very modern and the location is great! The have bicycles you can use and go around the city. The breakfast is AMAZING and the staff is very friendly. All is wonderful with this place once you find it. To find it at first is a challenge though. The hotel should send some detailed instructions to locate it. But once you find it you will be happy with it.","15309":"Just back from Sicily and after landing at Catania airport we chose Habitat for our first night. The drive from the airport could not have been easier (15 mins) and when we parked in their garage, their porter grabbed our suitcases onto a trolley and took them straight to the hotel. It couldn't be in a better location with sights, restaurants and bars all around. The room was very stylish - simply and very tastefully done and the bed super comfy. Breakfast was great in a gorgeous room. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because of the noise from the bars close by. But even that seems harsh as what do you expect if you are staying in the middle of the city?","15311":"My daughter performed at the Teatro Massimo Bellini so I chose Habitat which is conveniently located next to the theater and minutes from Catania center. The area is fairly safe with police presence. To get in the building , one has to unlock the impenetrable door on the street. Another locked door to the reception area, then to your locked room. The room and bathroom were clean and modern. The AC could be lowered to 26 degrees Celsius, comfortable but I preferred a little cooler. The breakfast was on time and above expectations for an B&B with good selections of foods and beverages. We highly recommend this B&B and definitely will return here next year for our daughter\u2019s performance.","15312":"Went on a girl trip in Sicily and we stayed at the Habitat in Catania for few days. The outside looks like an old run down apartment complex however when you walked inside, it was a godd surprise. They turned what looked a run down complex into a adorable eco friendly hotel.  The moment you ran the door bell, a staff was out to greet you and helped with your bags. You walked through a hallway which was surrounded by trees and plants into the hotel receptionist area which looked like a family room. Our rooms were in the next building (again looked run down on the outside) but inside is all very modern. Our rooms were large with nice big bathroom and shower. All products are organic and very cute. Most impressive was the breakfast in the morning. Fresh brew coffee upon request. Fresh bakery and the croissants were just YUMMY. Cold cuts, cheese, fruits are all ready in the morning. We had to depart for airport at 7:15am and they had their staff to be ready to bring out breakfast for us at 6:30am (normal hours are 7-10am).  Location was very convenient. 5 mins walk to restaurants, bars, city center. Fish market is a must to go with lots of restaurants. Seafood is their main diet and you can't get any fresher than that.","15318":"Our experience at Hotel Politeama was wonderful. The reviews that I read on trip advisor were very accurate. We had an incredibly warm greeting , received information on things to see and a dinner reservation to a great restaurant. It is a wonderful location for walking around and seeing the sites. The room was sound proof. I absolutely loved soaking in the bath tub! The breakfast was absolutely amazing. The gal serving coffee was really working hard and doing such a great job. Having Mimosa's was like the icing on the cake so to speak. You could squeeze fresh orange juice and add sparkling wine! There was also so much variety to enjoy. The fruit, pastries and warm breakfast items were very tasty! It was nice being able to trust the car park with parking & it was not very expensive!","15321":"We had a one night stop in Catania and stayed at Habitat. This property is in a great location, short walk from being dropped off by the airport bus and a short walk to the railway station. Well located for restaurants and key sights. The room was exactly as described, well appointed and comfortable. Whilst the property has a generally \u2018unfinished feel\u2019 don\u2019t be put off. Breakfast was good quality, local and tasty. Only negative for us was the noise from neighbouring bars, all was quiet when we went out but the street scene had changed once we returned after dinner, we were aware of noise until well after midnight.","15323":"Extremely friendly hosting, very nice location. Breakfast, rooms, coffee is extremely awesome. Might be kind a expensive, but it is worth for it. Private garage is a big plus. Bellini center could be noisy sometimes but does not effect that much. Really recommended.","15324":"Excellent: I stay often in this hotel and every time I find excellence and quality. Central location, beautiful view from the rooms directly on the theater, always very kind and helpful staff, the quality of food at breakfast is extraordinary for freshness and variety, comfortable and modern rooms. Every time the best!","15327":"Arrived here very quickly from landing at the airport as booked the airport transfer directly with Habitat. Stayed in a front room in the new block which was simple though stylish with wonderful high ceilings and the best noise insulation ever. Large firm,though very comfy bed and pillows and crisp cotton bedding. Great shower and lovely toiletries with large bath towels. There was also a small fridge and a good size safe drawer for valuables. Breakfast was taken in the stylish breakfast room with a good selection of various foods. All the staff we came into contact with spoke good English and genuinely cared about the business. The location is great with most things being a few minutes walk away from restaurants bars to the main shopping street of Etnea. Highly recommended.","15329":"Great concept. Great convenient location. Feels like a youth hostel for adults. Decorated in a way that you don\u2019t realize the lack of light or views. In fact, I kept searching for the bathroom light until I realized the brightness was due to a sky light.  During the day the square seems a bit desolate but by nightfall it gets quite busy. Almost too busy as you can hear a little noise. Lots of bars and nightlife right outside your space.  Rooms were large and modern.  The breakfast room is welcoming and conversations naturally start. I think this could be a great home base where travelers have the opportunity it\u2019s to make new friends. The staff are very down to earth, welcoming, speak good English. and contribute to the positive vibe. They go out of their way to make recommendations and they seem to assist in helping you plan tours or logistics. And you don\u2019t feel like they are recommending for a kick back.  They arranged a taxi for us back to airport the next day, the driver was prompt, professional, and charged us what we expected.  Breakfast was one of the more creative ones on this trip.  A great modern travel concept. They said they recently acquired more properties and will be turning this into a boutique hotel. I\u2019ll be curious how this concept develops.","15330":"There are a lot of hotels to choose from in central Palermo, and in recent years I have opted to do vacation rentals as most hotels are dated, and their offering very outdated - not to mention thin windows and lots of noise. Hotel Politeama is such a departure. Its modern, clean, the rooms are well equipped and to a high standard, the bar and lounge area comfortable,and the staff friendly and accommodating. I work in Palermo twice a year, and this is now my default accommodation choice. Highly recommended.","15331":"The staff are so hospitable and very helpful. The breakfast was straightforward and of good quality. Our room was new. very fresh with a great shower. It was a terrific place to use as a base for site seeing. Catania itself is interesting but sadly a bit on the dirty side with a lot of graffiti on many buildings. But still worth seeing.","15334":"We stayed for one night on our tour of Sicily. We received a friendly welcome. The staff even stored my brothers luggage for the day, as he was not staying the night. They arranged transport to the airport.  The B&B itself has common areas decorated very nicely with a hip vibe. The room itself was very clean and the bed comfortable. Wi-Fi speed was excellent. It was very quiet during our stay. The breakfast room had communal tables, which is nice if you want to acquaint yourself with fellow travelers. The entrance is on a pedestrian only walkway. At no time did we feel unsafe.  The B&B is in a central location right by the Teatro Massimo. It is a short walking distance to the cathedral and Etna Street, the shopping district.","15336":"We were lucky enough to get a room in the new block (a superior room admittedly) - but it was absolutely stunning.  High ceilings and generous proportions. Balcony views out onto the street - where there is so much life but where excellent double glazing screens it out when it's time for sleep.  The d\u00e9cor and design is beautiful - simple, elegant with great attention to detail. A combination of industrial, contemporary and at the same time using original features (19th century tiles) wherever possible. Difficult choice of a luxurious deep free standing bath or a glamorous rain forest style shower. This is the kind of room in which you want to hang out and pretend that it's yours.  Breakfast is communal with a great spread to 'standards' together with local cheeses, meats and fruits.  It would be daft to stay anywhere else at this price point","15337":"Central location places you in a beautiful walkable center. Adjacent to a major city square, you can easily reach city sites as well as stores highlighting major Italian designers. Hotel staff is capable, friendly, and ready to offer local tips (e.g. when we were challenged with parking during the Christmas holiday). Rooms are clean, bright, spacious, and quiet. Plenty of room for the three of us. The bathroom offered a comfortable shower that kept the floor dry despite the three of us testing its full use (unlike a few other European hotels). We slept easily despite a lively party on the ground floor and traffic down below. Recommend planning ahead if you bring a car. It was a challenge navigating due to the holidays and some roads are limited to those with special passes. The hotel offers garage parking but advised us against it due to unpredictable holiday scheduling. We had no issue with on street parking after following their recommendations.","15340":"We went on a family trip to Catania and stayed at this lovely place very well located and clean .Family room was very spacious . The B fast was amazing with a spread of sweet and savoury prepared freshly every morning . The staff were super helpful would definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting Catania ..","15342":"This is a gem of a B&B . We arrived in Catania late but the hotel organised our transfer so we walked off the flight into the car and then into the hotel which made a long day much easier. All around the hotel is the bustling area of the Teatro Bellini so plenty of choices to eat and drink .The location makes exploring really easy and the train station is in walking distance so onward travel is simple. The staff are amazing and Frederico really makes sure you have everything you need . The hotel is spotless and how they keep the jars in the restaurant so clean I do not know ! The breakfast is amazing every day is different and freshly cooked .We had a tasty back olive and tomato salad then roasted rosemary potatoes as well as the usual breads meat and cheese. The chef clearly tries to give something imaginative every day .The hotel was so peaceful and I have seen other reviews raising concerns about safety but I never felt at any risk . I was sceptical about a B&B as opposed to a hotel but this was of such a high standard so I would certainly go back .","15344":"We spent Christmas in this B and B and it was fabulous!  The staff were quite accommodating. I started messaging them early with emails and they responded to all. By the time I arrived everything was in order for our tours and Xmas dinner.  The breakfast was fabulous! The chefs do a great job with great assortment of food.  It is situated in an alley way and there was no one after hours, but we never felt unsafe. There are nice bars and pubs in the area that are open in to late at night.  During the day you can walk everywhere. The downtown shopping, restaurants, market, bus depot. Everything is only a few minutes away by foot.  We would stay here again!","15345":"Terrific hotel in nice area of Palermo. Comfortable room, good breakfast and helpful front desk staff. Close to both city bus stops and the stop for the airport bus. Quiet rooms, despite being close to lively area of the city.","15346":"1. The security of the hotel is very questionable the hotel is positioned in a dark alley where you enter with your key after midnight. And there is no security at the lobby as well. It feels like after midnight the building is left to the b&b guests. 2. The walls must be very thin. Aroind midnight my son an I we were talking inside the room with normal tone (no yelling no screaming normal conversation). The television wasnt even on. Yet someone from next door kept banging on the wall like a maniac. I replied with banging on the wall as well and someone from the other room started yelling and screaming in Italian. My wife stopped me from paying a nasty visit to their room.","15349":"Great location in Centro Historico de Palermo. Very friendly service. Comfortable room. Very good breakfast. Nice neighborhood. Restaurants, bars and shops close by. I travelled solo and really enjoyed my stay.","15352":"Very nicely redone! Excellent location- probably the best in Palermo for visitors. I would be very happy to stay there again. Room was clean, spacious, stylish and comfortable. We had three rooms, and all were fantastic. Would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone I know- even picky travelers.","15378":"We decided at very short notice - impact of Coronavirus - to stay one night here prior to our return flight. The hotel is very well located for Catania airport although it\u2019s situated in a light industrial area. Reception staff were friendly and helpful. Our twin room in fact had 3 beds: one double and two singles and was very large. Shower room and lavatory were separate from the wash basin. Beds were comfortable and there were no noise issues. However the room could best be described as bland. The lobby and bar struck me as equally featureless. Given the Government Coronavirus measures, the restaurant was unable to open but room service was offered for both dinner and breakfast. Dinner was good but breakfast was very average. Value for money overall was acceptable. Overall perfectly acceptable for one night if airport proximity is a requirement but if visiting the city of Catania as a tourist, I would recommend staying in the centre which is certainly worth seeing.","15384":"On arrival at Catania Airport every incoming passenger had their temperature take. A precaution due to the Virus. Better to have some arrangements in place unlike Bristol which had nothing in place. Good Alibus service to and from the centre of Catania at a cost of 4 euros per person. Small duty free and a few cafes are available.","15387":"Great hotel, We have spent 4 nights and it was very good experience in all the aspects. I travel a lot and I like when you have a sleep quality like at home. This is exactly the case. The reception service was very responsive and we've gotten the support in all our needs.","15404":"Airport shuttle is great (store their phone number) and hotel only 5 minutes away. Rooms are super large, clean, tasteful with balcony. Make sure you try 'The Simpson Pizzeria' - they use a wood fired oven, its cheap and the pizzas the best I have ever had in Sicily. It only opens at 6:30pm and is takeout only but worth it! It only 300m away, leave the hotel & turn right, its opposite the Caffe Parisi.","15411":"Overall good hotel for flying in or out of Catania, and if I was on business this would be perfect. The room was very large with lots of desk space for two to do work. The bathroom was very nice and super clean. The water pressure was outstanding. The WiFi was very fast and easy to use. I did have some cosmetic issues with the room such as the paint rubbed off, or the wall breaking around an outlet or unpatched Marable. The price is a little high for the offseason, but overall about right.","15424":"Only stayed 1 night but was very happy with the very cosy bed and beautiful decor. I've stayed in many places recently in Italy and this is one of the best quality. Breakfast is a small offering but still all you need and should expect from a very small b&b. The main city area was about 10mins walk away so the location is good too. Parking can be a bit tricky & the ticket meters are located only on the main road! There are some noisy water pumps in the bathrooms however - but they do stop after a while!","15427":"Stayed for 1 night after landing late into Catania.  Absolutely excellent hotel, staff very helpful and friendly, food good (@bar and @ breakfast) and room clean and spacious.  Highly recommend for a stop off between travels and good value too.","15434":"Pretty good for a 'generic' airport hotel. It's a large property, modern, with very big rooms that are nicely furnished. Most if not all have balconies. Surprisingly quiet hotel considering it is next door to the airport, I never heard any airplane noise. All the staff speak English.  Very clean and proper, comfortable beds, friendly & helpful employees in every department. A great place to stay the night before the flight. Nothing of interest to see or do in the neighborhood (it's an industrial area). A taxi to or from downtown is about \u20ac22. The hotel operates a frequent shuttle service to and from the airport.  I was very happy with my 2-day stay here and would not hesitate to return.","15438":"Arrived at 4pm after driving from Milazzo to be told that the room I had booked on Booking.com 6 months prior was not available. The whole idea was to stay 5 10 minutes away from the airport as we had an early flight the next morning. Instead we were transferred to their sister hotel, a 45 minute drive through Catania in rush hour (don't try it honestly) 5 miles away from the airport.","15444":"Great location if you need to get to Catania airport for an early morning flight. The shuttle bus is great but only runs beginning at 5. The desk staff was helpful, the room was clean and large and we had a delicious dinner in the restaurant the evening we stayed there. Bar could stand to offer more light lunch snack options. Did not get to try breakfast.","15449":"Booked in here in order to connect with morning flight. Terminal shuttle bus booked with reception the night before and worked well. The hotel is 800m from the terminal so walking with suitcases would be challenging. We weren't sure how getting to the hotel worked upon arrival so took a taxi at Euro 15 which was pretty expensive. Our room was clean and spacious with comfortable bed and roomy toilet shower area. Breakfast was ok with plenty of choices available.","15456":"It was a very good experience, all clean. Location is great, close the city centre. Breakfast was very good (typical Italian) as well. The room has air conditioner and TV. Internet available and Claudio (the owner) is very charming and friendly. I highly recommend this place.","15458":"We chose this hotel because it's less than a mile to the airport and we had a morning flight. Upon arrival at the airport we called for the hotel shuttle and were promised that it would leave in 10 minutes. No problem, we thought. Then 25 minutes went by without a shuttle and I called again and was told (again) that it would leave to pick us up in 10 minutes. Another 25 minutes went by and we called again and were again given the 10-minute story. We waited again, but then decided enough was enough after nearly an hour of waiting. We took a taxi to the hotel - minimum 15 Euro. And the hotel staff did not agree to reduce the rate of our room by the price of the taxi. Terrible transportation to the hotel and also the hotel's response to our complaint.  On the positive side, the person who checked us in was very nice and our room was very clean and spacious.  We could see the terrific-looking pool from our room, but could not go in the pool because the hotel closes it down very early (like 7pm, and doesn't open it in the early morning either). The gym evidently has similar hours, so don't plan on a workout early in the morning before your flight, or during the evening after getting in to the hotel.  Our departure, via the shuttle to the airport, in the morning was uneventful. (But we scheduled our departure from the hotel about an hour earlier than we preferred to since we were worried that the same fiasco with the shuttle would happen again and we didn't want to miss our flight.)","15468":"Very near the airport, in a very good quiet location , rooms very spacious and very clean excellent breakfast and mouthwatering dishes at the restaurant, will return for sure friendly staff  the pool very big and nice to swim in :)","15471":"This hotel is convenient to the airport, and was perfect for us as we needed to return to the airport the following morning. The rooms were nice and the restaurant was good. The shuttle was just a bit casual though. It took 2 calls to the hotel and more than 45 minutes to get a pickup even though it is only about a km away. Don\u2019t even think about walking as there are no sidewalks and the traffic is really heavy all the time. Returning to the airport with the shuttle requires a reservation with the front desk and it departs every 30 minutes.","15479":"We decided to stay near the airport instead of getting up at 2 am for the two hour drive to catch our 7 am flight home. We had my father in law with us so we requested a room for three. The room was quite large with a king and a twin bed. The bathroom was large as well. The hotel staff and transport driver for the airport were very helpful and professional. We would definitely recommend staying here. When we return we will stay here again.","15490":"Catania airport is of moderate size but needs a lot of updating. It\u2019s tired and worn. Catering is limited and the amount of space is crammed. On the plus side it\u2019s easy for drop off and collect and the hire cars are near by. Queuing to get on the plane at the gates also needs a lot of organising you can\u2019t have people standing for two hours with minimal ac working.","15492":"This hotel is convenient for people who need to stay near the airport, but is far from the center. Although it is only 1 km from the airport, taxi drivers charge an absurd minimum fare of 15 Euros. The bedroom and bathroom are huge. The breakfast is very good.","15505":"This hotel is perfect for overnighting prior to an early flight departure as it\u2019s minutes to Catania Airport. The rooms are massive and very comfortable. Staff were helpful and the shuttle service to the airport is really convenient. It is exactly what once expects from an airport property- convenience.","15513":"Wish I could give a negative rating! They gave our room away to traveling soccer teams and told us that the hotel was having electrical problems (they said this to multiple customers checking in, when the hotel was perfectly fine with all other stayers) This was a nightmare for us and 4 other family members as my partner had broken her foot and was on crutches and needing a wheelchair, however they still sent us to a hotel in the city centre.  We only booked here (months in advance) cause we had a flight the next morning. They said they would transfer us to the airport from our city hotel picking us up at 7.45am as our flight was at 9.45am. We called them twice the night before to confirm everything was all ok which they replied \u201cof course\u201d. We called again in the morning and said someone will come at 7.45am as requested...no one came...got to 8.15am and we managed to get a taxi which we had to pay for who was our hero in the end who amazingly got us to the airport after picking us at 8.30am, somehow we made our flight!  Would stay well clear from this hotel even if you don\u2019t need to be close to airport. If this place is the only place left to book to be near the airport for a flight just sleep on the airport floor. Worst experience ever!","15515":"The rooms (at least the one I stayed in) are awesome, really great paintings at the ceiling, however, the balcony was tiny. The staff was really friendly (even though some people hardly speak any English), the breakfast is good with several nice choices.","15544":"Modern and completely renovated (the whole staircase of apartments are made into various rentals). Modern bathroom with all utilities provided. High quality of bed linen and towels, spotless clean room. Quiet A C. Safe at night (gated community). 7min easy walk to main sights. Parking garage (paid) right in the basement. Breakfast from 7:30, but as we had to leave at 7AM the receptionist prepared plenty of breakfast options for us much earlier- very appreciated! The receptionist did not speak English, but he had a phone with google translate and it worked out just fine!","15550":"Location is very central -15 minutes on foot from the main bus station (to go to Taormina for example), and even less from Piazza Borsellino, from where you can get buses to other towns, such as Siracusa. If you land at Catania airport, just catch an Alibus for EUR4, and it will take you directly to Piazza Stesicoro, from where you can walk it to the B&B in less than five minutes. Piazza Stesicoro is bang in the middle of Via Etnea, where all the main shops are. The hosts are very nice and welcoming. We arrived after 11pm, and we found Piero waiting for us. They even emailed asking for our flight number to be able to monitor our arrival. The place was always clean and the breakfast food was varied. When Ketty saw that we were using soy milk, the following day we noticed that the selection of yoghurts included soy ones as well. Nothing to complain about... the only thing is that the bed was a bit small for tall people, but the proprietors do provide the dimensions before you place the booking. It was otherwise very comfortable.","15561":"Absolutely amazing place to stay. Very secure with a lock on the entrance gate as well as getting into the apartment. It was supreme luxury inside and the ceiling was so beautiful to look at when lying in the super comfy bed.  Lighting was perfect, having both mood and reading lighting available. The room is airy, large and bright, yet you can shut this out at night with shutters and curtains. We didn't hear any noise outside so a perfect sleep was had.  The staff are professional and helpful. The check in and out was easy. The breakfast was ample and tasty. The bathroom was extremely clean and functional, with a perfect shower for both pressure and size. Loved the seat in the shower cubicle.  Location was good with only a short walk into the centre, or very close to some food places.  If we could have been able to open the other door into the bathroom, it would have been easier to get in. But would still recommend this place to stay, 100%.","15570":"This place is absolutely stunning. It's elegant and situated in a beautiful old building. You can see that someone put a lot of effort into arranging the decor, and I personally felt like a princess, with all these stucco ceiling decorations, queen bed, and great art on the walls. It's classy and very tasteful. The owners are very nice and chilled, I felt warmly welcomed. I'm going to reccomend this place to everyone, it's the best accomodation I found in Sicily. The view is on an old house across the street. Fantastic!  The room had everything that I needed, including a hairdryer, and a kettle.","15571":"First, nice room, quietest night and amoung best bed in similar B&B's in Italy, but be ready for a bit of a mess in neighborhood. Trouble finding it, small dark street with construction scaffolds (quiet from 6pm to 7 am thankfully) no street signs (take 2nd little street in piazza off of Via Roma, not the first which is the market street.) Lobby dirty ( I know lobby not his, B&B is 4th floor only) lots of stairs. Really good breakfast","15576":"This B&B is located in the heart of Palermo, inside the history centre. Good point to start discovering the city and its culture. The owner, Claudio is realy nice and helpful. The rooms are very cosy and clean. Breakfast was good. We stayed there on Saturday and were amazed about the atmosphere we found in Vucciria Market with its own street food ( fresh octopus and lemon was amazing) Has we wanted to stay for an another night but the hotel was fully booked Claudio helped us to find another one Great location Great service Great B&B Definitely we are coming back!  Salvatore from London","15579":"We travelled to Catania in November 2019, just for a short break, from UK. We have really enjoyed the stay here. Everything was good about this place, and the staff was nice and friendly. Will definitely come back. Amazing views on Etna.","15581":"We are a family of 4. We got an apartment on the 3rd floor, which spread over three floors. Top floor was the kitchen which had a small terrace. Then below was the small living room which contained a generous sized sofa bed which can sleep 2, plus a toilet. Then the lower floor had the double bed, ensuite bathroom and terrace. Overall, a quaint, tidy and clean apartment. Bit of a hassle going up and down the internal staircase, but do-able. The location of the apartment is great as well. Door step away from restaurants, bars, shops, pharmacies ... and about 10 mins walk to the main square.","15588":"We picked Catania for our home during our stay in Italy since it's easy access to Siracusa, Ortygia, Noto, Palermo, Cefalu, Catania and Etna. Helpful staff stored our bags on both sides of trip since we have inconvenient travel times. They have tours and can connect you with a car service. I wish I'd known how present and helpful they would be before I booked a different hotel for later in the trip. Just stay put and you are close to restaurants a beautiful park (Bellini). Cooktop, pots, pans, glasses dish soap and rags, fridge, coffee and tea, sugar, salt, balsamic and olive oil, wine and water provided! Hospitality plus.","15592":"I spent 3 nights in an apartment within Ferrini home on the recommendation of a friend. This is what I call my home away from home. Booking was cordial and efficient. Management was available on my arrival and the apartment was ready on arrival. A bottle of complimentary local wine was available as was some sweet local delicacies. The whole apartment is LUXURY finished and the standard of amenities are second to none. Well done and thank you to the management. I will surely be back :smiley:","15602":"We stayed in Apartment 2D for a week and really felt at home. The staff are very helpful and not intrusive - they checked in with us mid-week to see how we were getting on and were great to arrange taxi to and from the airport. Lovely spacious apartment with fabulous 4 poster bed and little terrace outside to enjoy the weather. Great kitchen and amenities and comfortable living area. No complaints.","15604":"We stayed in apartment 3F for 4 nights. The apartment was good size, two levels with bedroom at the top. A bit dangerous stairs during the darkness of the night, but we didn't have any accidents. The only complain we have is that the aircondition didn't work very well. The apartment had two units, and downstairs it was quite okay. But we were unable to get the bedroom cool enough for us, and didn't sleep very well. The location is very convenient for everything in Catania, only issue is the restaurant next door whose staff never gave up on having us eat at their place. We chose other places as we dislike pushy restaurants. The staff at Ferrini was very nice, and communicated well in English. The airport shuttle stops right outside the door, so convenient.","15611":"Simple B&B, offering good service, spacious rooms and a central location for exploring Palermo for a weekend. Six rooms, including one three and one four bed room, located on a side street off the main shopping street. 5 minutes to airport bus (6 euros one way) or 40 Euro flat rate fare by taxi.  Room remain cool. Good shower. Simple breakfast with good coffee and friendly family running the place.  Overall great stay and excellent value for money.","15620":"We booked Ferrini as it looked to be good value based on images we saw and what was advertised as it's features. It was an excellent location. Our personal experience is outlined below.  We were allocated room 3C at Ferrini Home in Via Monte Sant'Agata 5. The room was located on the top floor (3rd level) with access via stairs or lift . Room 3C was a loft style room with 2 sky lights. Unfortunately, upon entering the room we were surprised by how stiflingly hot it was, despite the air conditioning. We brought this to the attention of the staff who came to inspect the unit. They had a play with it and asked for us to give it some time. They were unsure and said they would call technicians to evaluate what could be done and then call our mobile phone to advise if there was any solution. It was clear to us that it was indeed indicating on but not at all effective. No call came whilst we were out so we were left to sleep that night in what felt like an oven. The next morning we approached the front desk and pointed out that it appeared the air con was not working and that it's location was useless being directly in front of a wall that acted as a barrier from any air being blown into the room or else it may have had some chance of circulating some air at least. That being said, our bed was up in a loft with a very low slanted ceiling which required caution walking around to avoid a head strike. With the bathroom being downstairs it was not ideal or safe as the awkward steel spiral staircase also sqeaked when walked on. Furthermore, any slight movement on the bed produced a loud squeak, probably the frame. Needless to say, no sleep for us! Things got a little more frustrating when during the evening we ran out of toilet paper.....only the 1 roll that was on dispenser. No spare to be found anywhere. I complained the next morning and the house keeper was very apologetic and embarrassed. We were told again that no rooms were available to recover the issue of the room temperature. We had to stay in the dark and block out all light to try and keep the room as cool as possible. On the positive, there was a well equipped kitchenette with substantial items to cook in room should one wish to. This was well thought out and a great set up. On check out our complaints were acknowledged and we were advised plans for new location of air conditioning unit were in place for after August. This led us to believe they were well aware of the problem. Too little too late for us unfortunately. All in all we had 3 uncomfortable sleeps and I would recommend that apologies can only go so far but doesn't make up for selling a room which is not fit for rental and no compensation offered We felt a little duped and being on holiday expected some much needed quality sleep.","15622":"We stayed for a week in apartment 3E at Via Monte Sant'Agata and had a lovely relaxing stay. The building has been sensitively restored and cleverly converted all done with typical Italian style. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful, everything went as planned. We took the alibus (4 euro each) and got off almost immediately outside. The stop is on Via Etnea(Stesicoro). Ring the office buzzer by the door to get in. Our accommodation was ample for a couple but is designed for up to four. You enter into the middle floor lounge area where there is a sofa bed, TV, and WC. Up the spiral stairs to the kitchen eating area off which is a private external terrace. Down to the bottom level is the bedroom, with an en-suite shower room. There is a small balcony overlooking the alley way. The kitchen was adequately stocked although we did not use the cooking facilities much. A microwave was offered to me (I requested it on booking) but we declined it. The room was serviced twice in the week we stayed on agreed days. Location was absolutely perfect to see all the old part of the city. The Teatro Romano & Odeon is a must see and if you visit on the first Sunday of a month it is free! We felt perfectly safe staying here at all times and never heard any undue noise (apart from the ac unit in the bedroom - only complaint!). The only slight irritation was the number of people trying to entice you into their restaurants but as far as Ferrini Home I cannot fault it. Yes, the bed was firm (to my taste) and there was some scuff marks on the walls but for the money this was an exceptional place. I have no hesitation in recommending it.","15626":"This has been a perfect stay. Quiet, ac, WiFi, and friendly Staff. We had help with transport and booking. And they recommended affordable and relieble services. The cleaners did not take the tips i left on the bed, which i hope means that they get paid fair :) And most important was the appartements in great standard and really close to all there is to see.","15628":"This is our 2nd stay with Ferrini Homes and both times is excellent.  The apartment is clean, well laid out and functional. The kitchen has all the basic equipment one would need to prepare a simple meal. They provide oil, vinegar and salt, as well as some coffee and laundry capsules.  The management seem very helpful and relaxed and the house keeper is normally nearby during the daytime if you need any refills or clean towels.  The apartment is very safe and secure. Supermarkets are within walking distance. You can visit the Botanic garden only 5 minutes walking distance.  Thanks very much! We will be back!!","15638":"Senior citizen female traveling solo. Apartment 1E is beautiful, building secure, close to all the major sights and shopping (including a supermarket). Staff fabulously helpful. Equipped kitchenette (no m w, but hob and coffee boiler.) Internet in the lower level. Fair warning: it\u2019s a loft apartment, with some rather scary steps to the upper level, so if you\u2019re afraid of steps heights it may or be for you. This is disclosed in the photos. Absolutely recommend, unreservedly.","15661":"We stayed here for a city trip in catania with our 2 daughters. Very nice and clean place with everything you need in it. De hotel is located in the middle of catania. The staff is also really friendly.","15694":"We have been company of friends. Property is just right in the center of Palermo! Parking is very close. Every room has its own nice design. Everything perfect starting from the moment when we arrived and owner offered me to go with to show parking near by. They offered good breakfast with personal attention to everybody of us. At the end of our stay thay even helped with a car, to arrange assistance with rent a car company. They spend couple of hours to do it, despite to the fact that it was time we had to check out. They even offered some snaks and when we solved problem they helped with a bags to take it to the car... I travel a lot but so welcome meet propably first time","15726":"rated at 2 stars but i felt better than a lot more places. the room is big, the place is quite, the ac works perfect, the hosts are very friendly and want to help. English is not their strong point but they are so willing to help that i felt at home. the breakfast has basic choices but all are good and you can have it in a terrace overlooking catania.  Strongly recommend the place.","15731":"The hotel is walking distance from the main attractions, shopping streets, restaurants bars and transportation to further afield. The rooms are modest but with most amenities. the breakfast is buffet style and has something for most tastes. the coffee is freshly made and usually brought to the your table. Breakfast is inside or if the weather is good outside with views of the sea. The staff are friendly and helpful","15733":"We liked this hotel better and better and are really glad we stayed here. The host is very friendly and helpful and did what he could to make us comfortable. Our room was spacious, very clean and with nice colors. The breakfast was really good with a nice selection of delicious bread, salt and sweet, yoghurt and fruit. It was wonderful to sit on the roof terrace to enjoy it. And you are so close to the main streets without being much disturbed; one minute and you are in the middle of everything. We were especially glad it was so close to the Teatro Massimo Bellini, and we definitely would stay here again if we visit Sicily again. So although the building is not impressive when you arrive, this hotel gives you really good value for money.","15736":"Nice hotel close to the Centre of town. Hostess was very helpful and room was very large and spacious for my wife and daughter and I. Beautiful roof top terrace breakfast area and breakfast item choice was good. Tip. If you can not park inside the courtyard then find some secured parking area nearby. We were parked in the street behind our hotel and our vechile was stolen. Puts a damper on the holiday. Though the hostess was as helpful as she could be in the circumstances.","15805":"Thoroughly recommend this little place, a little different and very quirky which we both loved. The location is perfect and there is a great little bar a few doors down on the left going toward the Piazza Duomo. The host was fantastic and if we return to Catania we will definitely stay there again.","15810":"The host makes this great place to stay even better. Went out of her way to help anyway she could and looked after my wife for breakfast with her gluten free requirement. The breakfast for me for good also with good coffee's, meats, cheeses and pastries. There was also a few cereals. The place only opened July 2018 so everything is freshly done.","15816":"Great experience, newly, super modernly renovated clean B&B with an interesting concept for the rooms, its in and old Sicilian apartment building and the B&B is on the 1foor, Elisa, the owner she is super friendly, in the communal kitchen there are food, water, coffee or tea to get. I strongly recommend this place. we didn't have a view from our room but it is not such a problem","15818":"The rooms are in a newly renovated big flat on a 1st floor of an old, classic building which is in about 500 m from the central piazza and the cathedral. The rooms have letter signs instead of numbers. We got the number D, the lady Diana room. The room was modern and clean with comfortable beds and spotless bathroom. There is a fridge in the kitchen full of food. We had to leave the room very early, so instead of breakfast we prepared ourselves some sandwiches and fruit. There is a nice small garden terrace next to the kitchen, ideal for some evening drinks or for the breakfast. The very helpful and friendly owner was waiting for us and left the keys of the flat.","15821":"Perfectly located for nice walks and easy access to the city center. Rooms are new and clean. Bathroom with very good shower. Nice quality towels and sheets. Mattress is good. Missing some more warm decorations in the rooms. Breakfast is basic don\u2019t expect much. Management nice and available. They organize taxi transfers from and to the airport with trustful drivers. No lift yet only one floor of stairs easily climbed. I recommend it. CIAO","15824":"We stayed at B&B Elmi for a week in April. We found it an ideal refuge from the noise and bustle of the city.  From the outside it doesn't look very appealing but once inside it is a different world.  Elisa, the owner makes you feel at home. The rooms are spotlessly clean and there is a modern feeling to it all.  The buffet breakfast consists of croissants, eggs, meats and cheese, all delicious. And the coffee is to die for!  It is well placed to visit all the tourist spots of Catania and bars and restaurants are only a short walk away. We would highly recommend staying here.","15840":"Best location to sleep in Catania. Amazing host! Elisa was really helpful with everything. The breakfast was nice, they even have gluten free options. The rooms were specious, very clean and relaxing. Every thing what you wish and want from a hotel! I strongly recommend it!","15845":"A place that definitely makes you feel like home... We spent 7 days in the Elmi's B&B and we are extremely satisfied by everything. Clean, situated in the center of Catania and surrounded by cafeterias, restaurants and several shops. The breakfast was rich...much more than the typical breakfast served in other places. The rooms had all the equipment you could ask for..Wi-Fi access in every corner of the hotel and the kitchen had a bar and a really beautiful terrace where you could enjoy your morning coffee, a drink or a meal. Last but not least, worth mentioning is the owner of the B&b who was truly helpful in everything we needed. She spoke perfect English and she gave us information about what to visit and what to see...where to eat or drink. We are deeply grateful to her! I suggest this place to couples, group of friends, business trips, solo travelling or even families. 5 out of 5 stars!","15868":"As usual it is really nice to visit this B&B. Located in a very good area, can be reached easily by bus. Few minutes from the center. Owner are really friendly . They always give you a good service. Breakfast is great :) Its a pleasure to visit B&B xx miglia.","15881":"I stayed in more than 100 hotels and guesthouses over one year. And this was one of the very best, a renovated old property that retained dashes of character in spacious, comfortable rooms  Personable service and flawless English from staff who provided knowing restaurant recommendations and a cracking breakfast. The building and area looks a little iffy. But the convenient location makes up for it. Highly recommended.","15885":"When my wife and I arrived in Catania we had arranged a transfer from the airport with Cristian by email. Despite our flight being 1.5 hours late, the transfer was there as promised and very quickly we were at B&B XXMiglia. As has been said in many of the reviews, the initial impression of the area is not good and there is a climb to get to the b&b. Cristian had arranged for our case to be taken up the stairs and, when we arrived, we were delighted with the room we were given for our 10 night stay. We never had any feeling of being threatened at all in this area. It is simply a very ethnic area and the people there are not finding it easy to make their living. We very quickly began to feel totally at home with Cristian and Angelo and they could not do enough for us. Everything was relaxed and friendly and we met so many nice people from many different countries who were staying there. I have stayed in many hotels in the past but nothing compares to staying in a b&b as good as this one is. The restaurant just round the corner is very good and the prices are amazing (If you like Pizza then this is the place for you). On our last night my wife was so excited to learn the cooking of authentic food of Catania which we then ate with the two of them. It was an excellent evening and one which we will not forget. The bus and train stations are within 6 or 7 minutes walk and we took the train to Siracusa and buses to Taormina and Noto all of which I would recommend. The guided tour of the Monastery which is now the University is an absolute must and was one of our favourite things we did during our trip to Catania. We did both the small train and the red tourist bus which were only ok but nothing to get excited about. If you only have a day in Catania it may be more appealing. Sorry if I have gone on a bit in this review but I just cannot speak highly enough of these young men and what they have done in this b&b. My wife and I are around 70 and would adopt these guys. Thank you so much Cristian and Angelo for giving us a haven during our stay in Catania. They even both came to transfer us to the airport for our return home which we found very special. When would you ever get that from a hotel?","15906":"This B&B has been a very surprice ! Excellent position very close to the city center . The guys that manage the place are friendly and very nice people ! The unique problem I had it has been that I couldn't stay longer ! The room, a single for me , very nice space, clean, new, comfortable, with all the facilities . Very Good Wifi . The breakfast surprised me too, first at all the beautiful room with all the painted cealing that maintain perfectly the 800 900 century style . I can definitely recommend this B&B if you are going to visit the Beautiful city of Catania ! 10 + ! Well Done at the owners !","15912":"We stayed here for 3 nights and enjoyed every single minute of it. The rooms are spacious, quiet and the bed is super comfy. The room has a little balcony but the B&B also offers a rooftop terrace. Perfect for lazy summer evenings. The owner is super helpful and recommended us the best restaurants in the city. On top of all this, the breakfast is the best we had in sicily. I highly recommend to stay here.","16013":"The online photos were beautiful. I love architecture and had really looked forward to coming. I\u2019d tried making a reservation direct with the hotel but they didn\u2019t respond after a day so I booked through a booking service (their website is Italian only). I did email the desk about upgrading my room. After five emails back and forth with them telling me there\u2019s an extra charge and me saying I realize that I gave up. Then I realized I booked one day too many. I\u2019d be checking in Jan 28 and not the 27th. I didn\u2019t expect a refund but the email I got back was downright unfriendly. \u201cwe inform you that unfortunately if you will make no-show tomorrow, you should make a new reservation from 28th January to 01th February 2020.  Unfortunately there are some conditions to respect with the agency, and your reservation is not refundable in case of no-show at check-in date.  Thanks for your comprehension.  Best regards  Giuseppe Rapisarda\u201d  I called the booking service who straightened it out. I asked (nicely) to speak to a manager. No manager is available.  I\u2019m really disappointed. Doesn\u2019t help that the room is dark, dingy, and smells of mildew. I\u2019ll add some outside photos tomorrow that will stun you on how different they are from online photos.","16021":"Tucked away on a side street, this place is a find. Staff were friendly and obviously love their jobs. The breakfast selection is delicious and eating in the sun on the patio is the perfect start of the day. Aperitivos and wine at night under the stars left us feeling relaxed and happy to be in this wonderful city.","16023":"The staff is outstanding. I cannot praise them enough. They are friendly and very helpful. They do need more help at the front desk. Often, five people were in the little lobby for help while the desk clerk scrambled. The beds were comfortable. The hotel is quirky and charming. Breakfast was excellent.  I take issue with the management. We had requested an larger room with an upgraded bathroom and the workmanship and repairs were shoddy, someone sloppily caulked the tub over mold, and drains that don\u2019t work properly. Housekeeping attempted to remove the mold and were able to only reach that which had grown out from under the caulking. We were in and out the bath as quickly as we could. Soaking in the jacuzzi tub wasn\u2019t an option.  The hall lights are on motion detector switches that only trip as you are walking toward the room. In the opposite direction, You are in the dark til you pass the light. The lack of attention to details, some important (mold), some not (light timing), made me concerned for what we might not be seeing. This makes me think someone is not watching over the entirety of the property and operation.","16032":"Stayed at Manganelli Palace Hotel for 1 night October 2019. The hotel is very conveniently located to the airport - it was a 25 euro cab ride, but I could have easily taken the metro as the stop is only a few blocks away.  The hotel is located off a palazzo adjacent to the key shopping and sightseeing area off Via Etnea. Walking along Via Etnea will bring you the main square of Piazza Del Duomo. There are lots of lovely cafes and stores selling reasonably priced, but very chic, Italian clothes. Not too many tacky souvenier shops.  The area immediately around Magnanelli Palace is a real neighborhood. You can see people hanging up their laundry to dry off their balconies. Checking on the profusion of potted plants on the balcony set out to soak up the Sicilian sunshine. This is an authentic Sicilian neighborhood. There are still some buildings with stucco peeling off the sides of the buildings. Some graffiti. It is not overly sanitized, which means you will be getting a true taste of Catanian life. The hotel is on the 4th floor above the street so I was not bothered by any street noise. But then again I wear earplugs. The air conditioner was a bit noisy.  The hotel staff are very friendly and efficient. Check-in was a breeze. The couple in front of me were asking for dining recommendations and the desk clerk was most accommodating for them. I personally didn't ask for any recommendations but have no doubt he would have been equally as forthcoming for me. There are many dining options in walking distance, so you will have no trouble finding anything from a rustic trattoria to fine dining in easy walking distance to the hotel. The room was very large by European standards. The bathroom small but efficient. Came with a bidet which is also standard. The bathroom amenities were small but usable. Plenty of hot water and the shower easy to figure out. There is a mini bar in the room - good for keeping leftovers in. They did charge me 1.50 Euro for the bottle of water I took, which was on the expensive side.  The aperitivo offered is a steal! For the cost of a glass of wine (I paid 14 Euro but there might have been cheaper alternatives) you get to eat off the aperitivo buffet for free - as much as you like. The food was delicious and a huge variety. A fresh avocado salad, caprese, sliced meats, salad, etc. Definitely enough variety to make a nice simple dinner. Breakfast was also delicious and plentiful and was included in the price of the room.  Check out was good.  Overall highly recommended.","16034":"Lovely hotel. The hotel is on 3rd and 4th floors. My parents stayed in a double room on 4th floor, my aunt on 3rd floor and I got a flat (no room number, but flat) on 4th floor but needed to use stairs to go down to rooms so the flat was somewhere between the 3rd and 4th floor. Very interesting never has seen such but just loved it. Daily cleaning, lovely breakfast on terrace of top of the building. We spent 3 nights there. Our rental car was parked in the hotel courtyard.","16036":"We two were in a Standard room with double bed, room 404, for 2 nights. Location is convenient to airport shuttle bus, fish market, main shopping streets, and is about a 15 minute walk to bus   train stations. Friendly service from all staff.  Very good value. In particular the included breakfast was excellent. There were tables inside and on a terrace. Extensive choice of foods and drinks at the buffet. Drip coffee available and coffee on order (eg espresso) offered also. Meats, eggs, fruits, cereals, milk (cow and soy), juices, yogurts, cheeses, breads, pastries...  Our room faced a quiet inner courtyard. The ceiling was high with unique painting and other decor. Bathroom was new and clean. Internet (over Wi-Fi) worked very well.  The hotel arranged us a car ride from the airport, and said we could pay by credit card. Car was there as scheduled, with a very competent tattooed female driver who got us to the hotel through a complex series of non-main roads with interesting local urban scenery. When we went to pay, the driver could not take credit card herself but had to go to the hotel front desk... we just paid cash to make it easy.  TIP: if going to from the bus or train station with luggage, there is a little-used bike trail along one street that is very easy for wheeled luggage -- unlike the dirty and curby parallel streets. When using Google Maps walking directions, it is the route that goes down Via Giovanni di Prima -- which by chance includes one block where the street has been named after Tony Curtis (Via Antonio de Curtis).","16046":"Centrally located and in walking distance of all sites. This hotel was truly somebody's palace a long time ago. Staff is very pleasant and helpful. The hotel is clean. Check in time is 2 p.m. if you arrive early and there are wonderful restaurants all around. Definitely recommended.","16052":"The people who run this establishment truly understand customer service - providing a wonderful experience appeared to be what they strove to achieve each day. We loved the spacious room and the roof top bar and outdoor breakfast area where you can see Mount Etna. The location is great - you are within walking distance of the main streets areas - very easy to find your way back to this place from wherever you venture to.","16060":"Clean Hotel in the center of the city. The staff was friendly. The breakfast was good and they have a roof-terasse where you can sit and have a look over the neighbourhood. After a day full of walking and shopping in the city you can enyoi a glass of wine there. Take a hop on hop of bus tour to the cyclope rocks when you are in Catania.","16062":"This is not a modern 5 star hotel with pool, gym and minibar, but that's not why we travel. What it does offer is a clean room, a nice breakfast buffet and secure parking. It is within easy walking distance to most major attractions in Catania and the major shopping street for your nightly passeggiata. I would recommend this to anyone looking for good value for their tourist dollar.","16064":"Charming hotel close to the main streets and to the impressive Teatromassimo. Nice reception staff, wonderful roof terrace, the location, and the personal touch of the breakfast, made this hotel a very good place to stay. God mixture of old and new style in this old Palazzo, clean, good beds, and we enjoyed it. Would recommend it for my friends, and will gladly stay here again.","16080":"When we arrived we were a little scared, this hotel is hidden in a street. The lift is quite small (there are at least two, actually, depending where your room is).  However, we were very impressed by this hotel. It is in walking distance of all the major sights, and inside it is nicely decorated and clean.  Whenever we are in a major city we worry that it will be loud, especially at night. However this location was very quiet - this is always nice after a long journey or flight.  The breakfast tasted good and fresh, and is situated on a lovely outdoor terrace. Staff were friendly and helpful.  This felt closer to a hotel than a B&B (it seems advertised as both, depending where you look), and was excellent value.","16103":"Nice refurbishment - palazzo decorations are kept, however you do not feel any signs of dilapidation. Good breakfast includes local specialties and is served in an atmospheric roof terrace. Many thanks to the staff, everything was just perfect.","16114":"Friendly staff and comfy hotel. Breakfast is great with a nice terrace over the district. The room is quite big with a French balcony. The building is basically an old palace which was transformed into a hotel. Original paintings are found in the ceilings of the rooms. Paid parking square is available outside the hotel.","16116":"Sort of buried in a dead end street, the hotel occupies both sides of the street with a passageway over the street connecting the two. The rooms are pleasant, the food for breakfast good, and the location is excellent. Price not unreasonable for the location and quality","16121":"Hard to gain entry - buzzed in if the desk clerk is at the desk BUDGET ROOM was disgracefully small for the price. Carpet was DISGUSTINGLY DIRTY Shower was small Bed was small and uncomfortable and in a corner No cold water NEVER AGAIN","16123":"This Hotel is actually on the 4th floor of the palace building with on site parking, the rooms are clean and very spacious, we had room 103 for a week and then the suite for a couple of extra nights , The roof terrace is great for breakfast and the staff are all very helpful. The location of this Hotel is ideal, right in the centre of Catania with restaurants and bars in the vacinaty, The Cantina Manganelli is very good with fresh food and good prices. Ideal for all shopping and other attractions, We will use this hotel again.","16129":"We had to cut our stay here short by one day due to an airline strike. However, while we were here it was a great experience. The hotel dates back several centuries. However, they did a great job updating the rooms for modern conveniences. And yet, no ruining the character of the palace. The staff from reception to housekeeping to breakfast are excellent and very customer oriented. I had a place for my car rental which was in their courtyard. The staff at reception was helpful with travel directions. I can't say enough great things about this hotel.","16131":"It\u2019s hard to know what to expect from the outside but the human touch by the staff wins you over.... Breakfast is delicious and so inviting. We were too tired to go out the 2 night so we ate in the terrace it was romantic and Paola went out of her way to make it special. The elevator is heaven sent since the prior 2 hotels were on the 3 floor and no elevator. It\u2019s so close to everything, in the middle of it all. I highly recommend it !!!!","16138":"We only stayed one night at Hotel Manganelli Palace but it was excellent and would have stayed longer had our travel plans permitted. From the moment we arrived we were treated with 5 star service. Great hotel, service and people. Highly recommend.","16142":"We stayed at the beginning of our three weeks trip on sicily in this hotel for two nights and a second time when we were leaving for one night. We stayed in the \u201eflat\u201c both times and were very happy with it. :-) It is not one of the rooms with a pretty painted roof but is has a nice bed room and bathroom joined by a little living room. The interesting thing about this room: you are going down a narrow stairway from the main floor after you stepped through your door. Then there are several steps before the bathroom and two or three to the bed room. Nothing for people with disabilities!  We found it to be very cosy and with windows only our to the inner courtyard it was very quite even with the windows open.  The staff was very friendly and we could safely park our car in the inner courtyard. The breakfast was yummy and as a highlight you could use a lovely rooftop terrace all day :-)  I would only recommend to stay in a room with windows to the inner courtyard because the street and the piazza in front of the hotel is always very noisy.  Good stop for the beginning and ending of our trip!","16145":"The hotel is located in the heart of Catania. It\u2019s not a big hotel, with narrow corridors. Yet we got a spacious room with a bathroom. Free toiletries every day and towels changed every day as well. They serve delicious breakfast, with fresh orange juice and delicious Italian coffee. From the terrace you get a view to Etna - impressive. I do reccommend this place to everyone visiting Catania.","16174":"Nice, small and clean room with good bathroom. So kind staff. Special thanks for girl on breakfast. So delicious meals. The reception is on 4th floor. The hotel is so close to the centre( The Elefant sqear).","16175":"This hotel is on the top floor of a somewhat gritty building not far from the main square in Catania. A new elevator was being installed during our visit (a bit of bad timing). The staff was very pleasant. There is a outdoor roof terrace where one could eat breakfast in the warm weather or just lounge. The public areas were pleasant. The room was comfortable.","16182":"Having read a review in The Guardian for Al Giardino, we were so impressed we cancelled our original accommodation booked in Palermo and contacted Donatella directly and confirmed our booking on 20 3 19. When we arrived at Al Giardino on 6 7 19 and buzzed to be let in, she said she had her mother staying with her and had no record of our booking and cut me off on the intercom! Panic stricken, I got our iPad and pulled up the email trail as she would not answer the intercom again but I found a record of the phone number so called and was put through to an answerphone. I left a message advising her how unprofessional this was and quoted the dates of all our emails and that I would take this further. I continued to press the buzzer and she returned saying that she was arranging for someone to come to see if he could help us from another B&B. Luckily Giusseppe from Harmony B&B was amazing and sorted us an apartment out or this could have completely ruined our family holiday. I understand that Donatella may have had something crop up in her personal life but when you run a business, the least she should have done was to either email or phone us to advise before we actually arrived on her doorstep. Wouldn't risk staying with someone so unprofessional.","16183":"We were in Catania for an event and chose Casa Barbero because it was a few blocks away from the venue and stayed for a week afterward to tour southern Sicily. What great luck!  The B&B is located in a quiet street parallel with the main thoroughfare of Catania, via Etnea, about a 15-minute walk to the historic center, the Cathedral of St. Agatha, the famous fish market, and many restaurants and shops (there are also several buses that run on via Etnea downtown).  Antonio and Monica are the co-hosts, but we interacted most with Antonio. They both speak English and the ever-charming Antonio was the proverbial font of knowledge, as a lifelong resident of the city. When we arrived in Catania after an overnight flight into FCO and a multi-hour layover there to connect to CTA, we were greeted by a taxi arranged for by Antonio at our request. It set the tone for our visit. While we chatted at breakfast each day, he also provided us with a handy map of central Catania, referrals to restaurants and shops, and suggestions about where to visit outside of the city that dovetailed with the destinations that we had already chosen. His warmth and attention made us feel like true guests in his family home.  We found our room quiet and comfortable. We never knew how many other guests were there while we were. The B&B is located in a historic building with a central garden courtyard that is available for breakfast during the warm weather. We were there in January, so we had breakfast inside. Fresh Cappuccini and warm cornettos (croissants in the U.S.) were supplemented by, among other things, yogurt, hardboiled eggs, an array of cookies and fresh fruit, and bread for toasting. We helped ourselves to all. There is also a kettle in the room.  After 4 days of touring Catania, we rented a car to visit Taormina, Agrigento, Noto and Siracusa, and the mosaics at Palazzo Romano Casale. Antonio suggested a 24-hour attended parking lot a few blocks from Casa Barbero, because on-street parking is challenging. This made it possible to see parts of Sicily that we wouldn't have if we were reliant on buses and trains. The next time we visit Sicily, we will use Casa Barbero as our base again!","16185":"We were a group of 3 couples, having booked 9 months previously. Arrived at 9 pm from the airport to be told they didn\u2019t have the 3 double rooms as they were decorating. We were given 2 apartments - one for two a walk away and another for 4 nearer but it was a family room with a very uncomfortable sofa bed in the sitting room. Access to the bathroom was through the sitting room. Breakfast was very inadequate basically self catering, not in the \u2018lovely courtyard\u2019 No service. No warning of this was given.  A discount was offered which did not compensate for the experience. Card machine broke down so only took cash. Too big a party to find somewhere else. Extremely disappointing. We can not recommend. I only give positive reviews usually but on this occasion I felt compelled to write this.","16191":"The location is excellent, close to everything in the historic old district and many good restaurants. The young man who works there is very friendly and helpful. The breakfast is very good with plenty of choices. The downside was the musty room, not a good place for those with allergies or sensitivities to odours.","16192":"Lots to like - a great location in La Kalsa just off Via Alloro, easy walking distance from the train station, two friendly cats, a degree of character in the room including works from local artists and, above all, excellent service from Murali, the Sri Lankan born concierge. Cleaning was also carried out very quickly and efficiently (Palermo is a tricky city to remain fragrant in) and the fruit at breakfast was enjoyable. Downsides are few although we might have wished for fresh bread at breakfast and prices are perhaps on the high side.","16193":"Stayed here for two nights. Had a large double room, was very clean. Staff were super friendly and helpful. A C worked perfectly  Located a short walk, 5 or so mins, from the centre of Palermo and the train station.  I would definitely consider staying here again.","16203":"Thanks to a Naples Air Traffic control strike we found ourselves stranded in Catania for 2 nights initially without anywhere to stay! Thanks to the excellent Dorling Kindersley guide to Sicily we managed to get a room in the Casa Barbero. It's in an old palazzo bang in the middle of the city indeed the main street Via Etna is a 2 minute walk and has only 6 rooms. Monica and Antonia are charming hosts and run a delightful small family hotel. Very much old Europe - perfect. Rooms are a good size and breakfast first class. Everything you would want to see in Catania is within walking distance.The city itself has a faded feel about it but it's full of splendid buildings and churches. If you are looking for somewhere close for dinner look no further than Trattoria DA Peppino, mention you are staying at Casa Barbero and you will get excellent and friendly service. Food in Sicily is top knotch.","16205":"What a delightful surprise awaits you when you unlock the outer door. You are in a beautiful courtyard with lush exotic plants. It is so quiet and peaceful - a haven of tranquility. Some of the en-suite rooms open on to this space, where breakfast is also served. Breakfast was superb. First of all we were brought delicious warm almond croissants and the best coffee I have ever tasted! A huge variety of fresh fruit, pastries and hard boiled eggs etc was tastefully laid out in the dining room. This room itself is to be admired, with its amazing original painted ceiling with intricate plasterwork, and a beautiful tiled floor. It was real treat to stay there and it is only a short walk to the main part of town. Antonio was a charming host and arranged our transfer from the airport and also a wonderful half day trip to Mount Etna.","16210":"Having been recommended this place by a friend, we found it extremely welcoming and pleasant. It is not too far from Catania city centre so you can walk there or catch a bus. It is quite close to a nearby metro station. Our accommodation was comfortable and clean. The breakfast courtyard was lovely and cool. Antonio, Monica and Matteo make every effort to make your stay a pleasant one and we really enoyed our time in Catania.","16229":"We very much enjoyed our short stay at Casa Barbero. We had three of the rooms which were all very nice and well appointed with all ammenities. Quiet, clean and comfortable. Lovely old renovated building with beautiful outside courtyard and garden. Very good location to walk to the city center to see the sights. Nice breakfast in the garden. Excellent communication with Antonio regarding arrival instructions and nearby parking. Casa Barbero is a small, quaint B&B located within walking distance to the city center where you will not be disappointed with your stay...highly recommend.","16255":"We stayed here for two days when we flew into Catania and the night before we left and chose the B&B for its proximity to the city centre by walking down the Via Etnea. It was an excellent location for exploring. The building itself is a converted residence that retains the feel of the original house but has been fitted out with modern furniture that is a great comfortable blend. The rooms are located around an enclosed garden that provides an excellent location for breakfast. There is easy-to-use key code access that Antonio, the host, told us about by e-mail before we arrived; this made check in and access very simple at any time. Hospitality was friendly and extremely helpful. We did pick up a car at the airport and found the location relatively easily (factor in Sicilian drivers) using Satnav; Antonio had previously told us about safe parking about 100 metres up the road. (Green Parking just up the street for 9.5euros per day). We would thoroughly recommend this B&B for its all round excellence and location.","16266":"Located a short block away from Via Etnea, you can walk anywhere on Via Etnea easily. Several wonderful restaurants in the area as well.  Our 2 rooms were lovely. Breakfast was great and the hosts are very helpful.  Short walk to the bus stop which can take you to the airport. Or have them provide transport.  We got a rental car before leaving Catania and parked it at nearby Green Parking lot. Easy to access and secure.","16275":"Easy communication with owner who provides code for keypad access at any time. Owner Antonio was very helpful. Beautiful clean rooms with historic tile floor and large ceilings. Dining room and entrance has lots of interesting artwork. Quite street , 1 block removed from main road of Via Etna. Location is probably further than most B+ B however about 20 mins to main historic section of Catania","16280":"This is a hidden gem and the location is fabulous to walk into town and see all of the sights ( just off Via Etena) Antonio is fabulous, very helpful with communication pre-visit then gave lots of information during our stay. The room was lovely (Adele) opened onto a lovely courtyard where breakfast was served which was delicious - excellent selection of pastries, boiled eggs, walnuts, juices etc -Fabulous ! Matteo served breakfast and was lovely and helpful too. Room lovely, bed so comfy and bathroom nice- all spotlessly clean. Really chilled vibe to the place with jazz playing at breakfast. this is the ONLY place to stay in this city and I will be recommending it to friends who are hoping to visit Sicily next year","16283":"We had a very enjoyable unexpected stay at this bed and breakfast for 2 nights due to arriving at another bed and breakfast we had prebooked and them unfortunately cancelling our reservation due to not having any electricity. They then found the Casa Barbero for us for 2 nights. Antonio the owner was quick to contact me and arrange the check in procedure, and make sure we were ok. He also arranged a very early transfer back to the airport whom was very prompt and done with ease. We were allocated the Adele room, which was lovely, large and comfortable, with a beautiful bathroom. The room opened out on to their courtyard. Matteo, Antonios son served us breakfast, and he was very polite and helpful. We appreciated the cereals, fruit, pastries on offer, especially the warm croissants and fresh coffee, and we had breakfast in the courtyard. The Bed and breakfast was in a good location within walking distance of everything. We had a lovely stay here and would thoroughly recommend. We were very grateful to Antonio and the team for assisting us in our circumstances and making our stay an enjoyable one.","16295":"Small simple B&B , only 5 rooms, very safe and charme with nice garden for breakfast.The only thing which needs improvement is breakfast, only sweet options, without cheese or ham. Although worse visit","16296":"Thank you Antonio for taking care of us at Casa Barbero. Due to flight delays we had a very limited but very restful stay at Casa Barbero. Antonio took time to make sure we could check-in easily after hours. He also recommended a great driver for pickup at the airport who we used later to return to the airport. Casa Barbero was our first stop in Sicily and gave us our first taste of excellent Sicilian hospitality. We loved the Bianca room, our first Sicilian breakfast and the location of the B&B. Antonio made our first day in Sicily Catania easy to navigate. Grazie!","16300":"My wife and I spent five nights in Casa Barbero, in the superior room Bianca. This B&B has everything for a decent stay in Catania - and even a bit more: Very clean, tasteful furnitured rooms, all necessary equipment (a TV that works for e.g.), a green garden in the middle, in which the traveler can start into the day with a healthy and rich breakfast. And not far, a place with different restaurants, a few bars, a supermarket etc. And all is held together with a warm professionalism by the owner Antonio. Outstanding place!","16310":"A charming b&b with a gorgeous little courtyard garden. It's about 10-15 minutes walk to the centre of town. We stayed in 'Bianca' a huge room with a balcony and a beautiful shower room, grey tiles, all very chic. Good wi fi, great coffee and wonderful attention from Antonio, Monica and Matteo. They are a joy to deal with and Antonio answered all my idiotic questions (first visit to Sicily was my excuse!) immediately. Spoil yourselves, go there, it's a gem.","16315":"Nice and roomy hotel room that easily accommodated our family of four.  Cost from the airport is a flat \u20ac40 and from the train station it is \u20ac15. However if you are able to catch a Metro, the station is very close to the hotel. Supermarket, atm, McDonald\u2019s is all located close by.  Room is accessed via a bunch of keys and the front desk only operates until 9pm. We found reception very friendly, helpful and even organised taxi bookings for us.  Can not provide a comment on the breakfast as we had to checkout at 5am which was a tad early for the kitchen staff.  The room setup was two single beds and a family bed. The room also had a safe, lcd tv, refrigerator and tea making facilities.  Good ample size bathroom and decent size shower.  Location is good as the Main Street is just a short walk across and plenty of eateries around.  Your typical European flea market operates right out your door in the morning and you can pick up pretty much anything.","16322":"Stayed here in Fall 2019 for one night. The hotel was lovely and the staff very friendly. Surrounded by a lush green park, but the bus stop was across the road. The local bus was free for us to use. However, things that cost us extra were the bike rentals and valet. On our check-out day, we were able to rent the bikes to go all over Palermo, which was nice and the front desk held our luggage and car for us. Would definitely recommend as a solid middle-range hotel.","16328":"We stayed here for a week in late September. Our room had a small balcony that overlooked part of the adjacent park. The room was clean, and they somehow always managed to clean it quickly, so that by the time we finished having breakfast on the roof the room would be clean again. One complaint about our room is that while it had two bathrooms, one of them had a terrible smell to it so we just kept that one closed the entire time (we never actually mentioned the smell to anyone.) Something else to note is that the key to enter the room has to be inserted into a slot after you enter in order for the room to have power (this may be how it\u2019s done in Sicily in general, as we had to do the same in another hotel.) Breakfast is available on the roof every morning. The food was mostly decent, but you are treated to some nice views. The hotel is a bit of a walk to get to the center of Palermo; we enjoyed the long walk as it probably was needed from all the eating that we were doing - but it may be too far for those that are not able to do long walks. There is a Jacuzzi but I think you have to reserve it - it was covered during our time. There is a bar next to the lobby and it\u2019s not terribly overpriced. Overall, the staff was very friendly and I think it\u2019s a pretty decent place to stay.","16331":"It was nice hotel with a few old telephones and typewriters as deco. It is located near a high end retail stores shopping area. I especially like the nice garden next door, and the easy one minute walk to airport express bus. We also found very nice restaurants within easy walking distance. In fact we had a nice evening and nice dinner near by.","16343":"We stayed in this hotel for 3 nights,the staff was very friendly who speaks english well.It's very central so we went around walking to interesting places.Although it's in a street where the market is held,we didn't hear a thing except the small refrigirator in our room.","16356":"This was a well-located hotel offering good value for the money. It is on the second floor of a building and was a bit difficult to find. It's also next to a early-morning flea market which could be a bit noisy.  But it's right next to a subway station (with one stop to the train station) and very close to a bus stop. The staff was very helpful.","16357":"This hotel is VERY well air conditioned which is very much appreciated when visiting Palermo in August. Our room had two rooms and might have been a suite - it had a living area with a couch and a bedroom. The hotel is overlooking a beautiful garden and about a 5 minute walk from the busy part of town. It has a gym and breakfast was included in our rate. They had free wifi that worked well. Our room had a spa bathtub which is unusual for Europe.  Our reception was very strange - I think there was a communication barrier because another guest arrived immediately before we did but we had to haul in our own luggage, despite me asking for help. There are stairs to get up to the hotel so I would have appreciated it if someone got our luggage. The staff is not smiley when you check in - this might be a cultural thing but it was not very welcoming in. We were hot and tired and so lugging our own baggage and then not being greeted warmly gave me a bad first impression.  However, the hotel is very nice and the room was big and the air conditioning was great. Would have been nice if they provided free water in the room. The soap and shampoo were very small. They offered a free razor and tooth brush. Room has robes and slippers. Might want to bring your own hair dryer because this one is attached to wall and not very forceful.  The staff ended up being very helpful and I liked my stay overall.","16365":"Stayed for one night. The Alibus stops near the hotel so it's very convenient. You can walk to downtown in 15 mins. Staffs were very friendly. Room was clean. Breakfast was good. Value for money.  When we have booked. We chose 1 queen bed but there was not even 1 queen bed, we got only twin beds pushed together and it wasn't comfortable at all as there was always spece between 2 beds.  For overall, if you need somewhere to stay near the city and doesn't want to spend a big money. The hotel catania town is a good choice.","16474":"Beautiful,old world hotel in a convenient location,short walk to city centre.Overlooks a charming park.Good breakfast,restaurants close by.Parking not an issue used feet!! Crazy to drive in Palermo!! Great gelato caf\u00e9 opposite park!!","16501":"Excellent location close to the Piazza del Duomo, many restaurants, bars and shops. It was a lovely modern apartment, very clean and spacious with good air conditioning. Roberta the owner was very helpful and provided ideas and suggestions for restaurants and trips throughout our stay via WhatsApp. Roberta also arranged a pickup and drop off to the airport which was very reasonable. We had a thoroughly enjoyable visit to Catania and I would definitely stay here again.","16509":"The room and bathroom were quite small, but perfectly adequate; very clean, neat and tidy. The rooms are on the third floor and the lift is very small, so don't take large suitcases. Due to it's close proximity to the main square, (one of the reasons I choose this B&B), it can get a little noisy at night time; however, I was so tired after each day, quire honestly it didn't bother me. All of the main tourist attractions, shops and restaurants are all within a 10 minute or less walking distance. Roberta the landlady met me in the square and showed me to my room; she is very helpful, knowledgeable, and polite; she showed me on the map where to visit and where to eat and gave me a list of the local food specialties - all of which I tried and thoroughly enjoyed.","16510":"We decided to book our short stay here after seeing the reviews and we were not disappointed! Honestly don\u2019t look any further: if you are going to be in Catania, this is the place you want to book. First off: the location - it really doesn\u2019t get more central than this. You are literally a few steps from every main attraction, and only a short drive from the airport. The rooms are spacious, new and impeccably cleaned. They have everything you need, from state-of-the-art A C, to super comfy beds, huge bathroom, amenities, kettle, and a lovely view. You have 24h access to a shared fridge, microwave and coffee machine.  Roberta has been wonderful: she gave us the most amazing welcome on arrival, and then shared a million suggestions ranging from things to see to where to eat. She was always available to answer our questions and accommodate our needs. We also booked the transfers on arrival and departure through her and we were extremely satisfied with the service provided.  We will definitely be back!","16526":"The property is very conveniently located. It is just a bit away from the very crowded area and also a boulevard separates it from run down neighborhood. From this location it is very easy to get to the 2 important monumental areas and the markets, we even caught a festival around this place. The welcome to the b&b was good, there are few tea and coffee facilities. The room looked good and everything worked fine inside, it had funny lights for shower. Considering the sweet breakfast was not that great, we appreciated that we got a salty option, 2 cheese types and 2 salami.  The communication with the property before arriving was difficult, as apparently the fee could not be charged. The building needs some refurbishment for main hallway, stairwell, interior courtyard. People were roaming around in the evening late and also some early noise in the property made us realize how bad phonic isolation is. No view from our room. Breakfast offer not that rich.","16528":"All\u2019 ombra is ideally situated right next to Teatra Massimo which means you are central to all the major historical sites and entertainment. The B&B itself is lovely once inside , the room we had was spot on with a balcony with views to the Teatra. Breakfast is basic but enough to start you off in the morning. We organised an Airport pick up for 35 Euro thru the b&b And was there waiting for us off the plane. Bus stop to get bus to Mondello Beach is About a ten min walk bus 806 takes u there in 30 mins 1:40 Euro one way, don\u2019t forget to validate ticket when you get on Bus (unlike me ) Palermo itself is a very vibrant city, awash with eateries and drinking establishments , all within easy walking distance from the b&b. Well worth a city break if you are thinking of it.","16534":"So first thing to point out is that a Bed & Breakfast in Palermo is not like you might find in the UK. Basically they are usually a couple of floors within an apartment building. The best way to find this building is to go to front of the Teatro Massimo then face the steps, go around the exterior wall of the theatre to the right hand side, until you are at the back right hand corner, then cross the road when you see Galloway restaurant and keep to left of restaurant until you see no. 36. Do not be put off by the dark stair way when you go inside the building, once you're in the B&B it is really beautifully restored and is very authentic. The staff are excellent and the place is spotless. I've attached photos of view from window...can't get much better than that :)","16541":"Do not be put off by the front door or the dark staircase to this bed and breakfast which is in the square next to the Massimo Theatre. Inside it is light and airy, well maintained, well decorated and impeccably clean. The room was large and en suite well fitted out. Breakfast was good and the staff friendly, helpful and efficient. Location is also good for much - most -of the great deal there is to see and do in Palermo. We would be happy to use it again.","16542":"arrived late due to bad weather in uk ,first impressions were not great just a brown door behind which was a very old fashioned clunky lift .But the whole experience after that was amazing !!!! helpful ,friendly,clean rooms decorated to a very nice standard, great big room with great view across to the theatre across the road .very quiet when you closed the double glazed door.air con,wifi ,bathroom all excellent .the b&b is in a great position in the city only two minutes walk from the main shopping streets and endless impressive buildings .breakfast was a delight nothing was too much trouble for Gabriella and her team .10 10 .have booked again for nov 2018","16567":"I think the heading captures a lot but to also say it was very clean, I slept well and the individuals, who I suspect are a family, are so nice and helpful. The breakfast had a variety of choice including fresh fruit so I did not go hungry : ) within 10 min you are in the main square so the location is quite handy. Be warned that you need to climb 2 flights of stairs to get to it just in case you need to ask for help in advance.","16662":"We stayed for a day in this marvellous place quite close to Catania. The agriturismo offers accommodation, restaurant service, swimming-pool and horse riding. A very complete programme if one wants to spend some time with family or   and friends. I enjoyed lunch with friends, simple but good starters, nice pasta and good meat. The staff is nice but somewhat agitated if too many people in the dinning room. Easy-going atmosphere with people coming and going from the houses and the swimming-pool. A little bit noisy if too many children and families meet in the main dinning-room. Nice and friendly atmosphere otherwise.","16741":"This was our fourth place to stay in our Italy trip and so far our favourite.The location is hard to beat, walking distance to everything.Below is a little street with bars and restaurants that gives it a very \u201c buzzy\u201d feel, and the noise at night is cancelled out by the double French doors and aircon. The breakfast was amazing, so much food, we never had to have lunch, and fruit, tea, coffee and sweet snacks available outside breakfast was a very nice touch. The room we had was lovely , modern and well laid out, a great retreat to return to after sightseeing.The drinks in the mini bar in the room were very reasonably priced. Last but not least, the warm and friendly welcome from the team, including great suggestions for sightseeing and restaurants. I would heartily recommend this place to anyone staying in Palermo. Only thing I would say is that we almost walked past the entrance as the sign is not prominent, and the suites are up the stairs once you enter the courtyard.","16743":"I recently stayed 2 nights in the Junior Suite & had a beautiful stay. The location is perfect as were the recommendations of places to visit and where to eat upon arrival. Great bathroom and the comfiest bed I've stayed on during my ~1 month in Europe (by far). The pillows were divine and everything was spotless. The team were amazing. Thank you so much for helping me with my printing :)))","16746":"I was there only one night before my trek to Etna. Nice apartment very close to centre. Dario is very helful guy and gave me nice recommendation for restaurant. Room was very authentic and nice, very quiet so I could sleep very well. On opposite side I wasted to leave sooner and breakfast was from 8:00. He didn\u00b4t arrange it sooner, he said me only Sorry go to cafe bar. And even didn\u00b4t give me discount because breakfast. But in general it was nice stay. Also he didn\u00b4t accept card only cash. But its very often in Sicily that they don\u00b4t accept credit cards. I was very surprised.","16754":"Never use the services of this hotel. You will lose money !!! They steal at a hotel\u044e. Cockroaches crawl in the room, in the dining room right on the floor. I spent time and money to nothing !!! I do not recommend it!!! NEVER BACK IN THIS HELL!!!","16767":"We visited with two four-years-old children. Rooms are spacious and nicely, simply equipped. We had a huge balcony, however it was connected to other rooms. The hotel staff are very helpful. Breakfast is basic but very nice. It's also possible to have dinner in the hotel. Although it's not a real restaurant, the food is very fresh and tasty. Excellent parking space is also available and free of charge. The only issue is the location. All city attractions are far; the closest restaurant is about 15 minutes walking. The supermarket is nearby.","16768":"Great staff , friendly professional attentive to your needs. Clean room quiet area down to earth people, love the women at the front desk she is a very nice person wish I had given her a proper tip, will definitely stay there again love the first class treatment. Samuel","16771":"The Villa hast new owners, who are very welcomming. We were afraid that we would not get a parking place for our car but the friendly staff took care of that. The room we stayed in was fine with a small balcony but the kitchen and the bathroom was still in need of some renovation (sounds worse than it actually was). Looking forward to staying there again.","16773":"The location of this hotel might not be perfect for everyone but it suited our needs of one night to stay before flying home. We had a car so driving into the center of the city was fast and easy. Our room was very clean and had large windows overlooking the rooftops the the neighboring buildings. The staff was super nice...very helpful and friendly. The free secure parking was a definite plus as was the generous free breakfast. Recommended!","16776":"This Hotel is surrounded by a high wall and you can only reach the Hotel area after calling the reception from outside at the street. The taxi driver told not to go out alone at night in this area. There are no restaurants or bars in the neighbourhood; one needs to taka a taxi to the centre. The room at the second level had no transparent windows just two small turbid windows and a wall outside. There was a big bunk bed in the middle of the room and a small table. The WiFi worked god but the breakfast was of very low quality. The lobby and common areas were newly renovated. I would classify this Hotel as 3 stars not 4 stars","16777":"I came to a meeting in Catania and the organizers booked me in this hotel. If was far from everything you might want to see in the city and from the meeting venue. It is located in an ugly, unsafe-looking neighbourhood, has no real restaurant and there are no restaurants close by. First thing I did when I got to my very, very basic room - with a window just above the sidewalk - was to go to the internet (good connection, I admit) and booked another hotel for the next morning. This is not a 4 or a 3 star hotel; more like a pensione in a very unattractive and remote part of Catania. The staff is plesant and helpful but... avoid the Villa Cibele if you can.","16868":"It was a nice hotel, the room was reasonable and the bathroom too. The wifi was really good. We have stayed only one night, next day we were going to fly home the next day. It was near the airport but also near the sea. We had a nice view of the sea so it was nice. We ate dinner there too, it was good. The breakfast was good too, we got eggs which was really good because we did not get it at a single hotel we were staying on during our holiday. The staff were really nice and helpful.  Aircondition could be a bit better, it was really hot in the room, but it was not possible to regulate more than that.","16875":"Ad hoc rooms is in the PERFECT location! In the connection of Bellini piazza, at the fountain of Shame, and a block from the Quattro Canti! The rooms are clean, modern and comfortable, and Luka and his family are great and helpful hosts. Loved the breakfast with fresh scrambled eggs! A+!","16881":"We stayed for a couple of nights and what a place! The owner is service minded, the rooms are well designed with pieces of antique furniture. Good location close to many places of interest. Be prepared for the flight of stairs though! Apart from that, everything is excellent","16884":"We stayed for 5 nights. Very good modern room (Theatre theme), delicious breakfast with a wide choice of food and above all a friendly welcome from Natalia, Luca and his parents. What more could you ask for ....","16886":"We have stayed in Ad-Hoc Rooms (fumetti and quadrupla) for three nights. The hosts are super nice. They provide a million info regarding Palermo and the surrounding region. The rooms are nicely decorated. The quadrupla is overpriced for what you get compared to the other rooms, unless you are really using it as a quadruple room (which unless your kids are very young would be like camping). The rest was simply awesome, breakfast and all. After a long day walking around Palermo, you really crave for a lift. That could be a plus. Other than that we had a terrible smell of sewers one day, but after informing the owner the problem was gone.","16899":"A lovely experience that 'made' our trip to Palermo! The owners arranged a taxi pickup from the airport so everything went smooth from the beginning. There are no stairs but they can help you with the luggage no problem to the 3rd floor where the B&B is located. The decor and design are top-notch, quality and elegance and a touch of modernity throughout the place. Every room is different in 'theme' so you could possibly stay there many times and always feel like a new experience. Wifi is fast, rooms are really spacious and kept spotlessly clean, location was top! We were only few minutes away from everything, endless choice of restaurants and lovely cafes just out of the door!  But super were especially the owners how engaged and helped us and gave us a feel of being home.  Make sure you come here to see the Real Palermo!","16956":"Molto vicino all'Aeroporto, all'inizio della Playa, la lunga e ampia spiaggia di Catania, frequentatissima da maggio a ottobre. Immerso nel verde ma a 3 minuti d'auto (o 10 minuti a piedi) dal Centro della citt\u00e0. Dotato di una bella piscina, una struttura in stile mediterraneo con un ampio terrazzo. L'hotel dispone anche di ristorante e di un parco. Attraversando la strada si \u00e8 direttamente sulla spiaggia, dove vi sono diversi lidi. | Very close to the airport, at the beginning of the Playa, the long and wide beach of Catania, very popular from May to October. Surrounded by greenery but 3 minutes by car (or 10 minutes on foot) from the city center. Equipped with a beautiful swimming pool, a Mediterranean-style structure with a large terrace. The hotel also has a restaurant and a park. Crossing the road you are directly on the beach, where there are several beaches.","16965":"The worst hotel I have ever been... The room is old and seemed dirty. The smallest bathroom I have seen... At the restaurant, with five guests, the waitress brought the wrong order. The only part that is good, is the reception personnel...","16966":"This is a three star hotel who deserves four stars due to the service of the staff. From the front desk to the bar, they go out of their way to help. Rooms are clean, hotel is a little out of the way, but the staff made our stay enjoyable","16969":"This hotel is close to the airport, but not in an area that I would walk in at night alone. My room, although it was on the small side did have a balcony (that I had requested) overlooking a lush garden area. Unfortunalely there was a great deal of mold in the small shower cubicle. The restaurant was very clean and bright, with a very nice wait staff. Breakfast was good as well as supper. I did enjoy the pool area with many recliners.","16973":"Cosy hotel with a real Sicily-feeling. Nice pool and the hotel are located nearby the beach (not the best thou) but you can actually see the volcano Etna while swimming in the ocean. Near the city and you can rent a bike or take a long walk to get there but you will get disappointed, it's actually a non-romantic city","16980":"We were scheduled to arrive Catania 200pm and then drive to Taormina. Due to a serious and potential dangerous in flight issue on Ryan Air forcing a return to Malta, we had a new arrival time of 11pm. We decided to get a hotel in Catania vs driving late at night so we booked Le Dune. We learned a few hours later we were not going to arrive in Catania until early morning and best case is get to hotel 330-400am. It made no sense to get a hotel then. I tried to cancel with no luck. I wrote a long email explaining the problem and no luck. They didnt even make the effort to respond. They just took my money. The room was booked maybe 4-5 hours","16989":"A very warm welcome. A very good simple hotel ideally placed for the airport or I guess, a visit to Catania. Spotless room, comfortable bed, nice shower, air con, pool, lido access, parking- I would certainly stay again Thanks","16990":"This place is nice if you come from the airport, but we were happy to stay only one night. At our arrival, we noticed a lot of dressed up people taking the elevator. We asked what was going on, apparently it was a birthday party. Considering the possible noises and the fact that we wanted to sleep (what a hotel is supposed to be for), we asked if our room was far from that party. The answer not been very clear, we understood that probably it would be hell so we asked for another room, a quiet. We got one but totally different from what we were supposed to get. The room was next to the parking outside and not at all the standard from the other rooms. It was certainly quiet but we should have then gotten a refund because it is not what we paid for...","16994":"After a very short trip (10 minutes) from the airport we were greeted warmly at the hotel Le Dune. The lady on reception was very helpful and it was a really nice start to our stay. Rooms were basic but clean, the fridge was an absolute Godsend. I disagree with other comments the showers are too small, I am far from a little fella and I managed just fine. Wifi was decent enough for me and my brother to watch the football too. Breakfasts were superb! Choice of cereals, pastries, cheese and meats, cooked eggs, ham and sausages, yoghurts, fruit, very good selection. Again I can't agree with other reviews slating the breakfasts at all but it's all about opinions I suppose. I certainly had no complaints at all.  Pool area was fab, quiet with it being off season so we had it mostly to ourselves.  To sum up - fab breakfasts, very warm welcome, great location for airport and beach (but go to the Lido Arcobalena - hotel can sort you a guest card as the rest of the beach was very grubby and litter strewn sadly)","16995":"Le Dune hotel is located on the seafront to the south of Catania City. It is very convenient for the airport which is about 1 mile away. My two sons and I stayed here for three nights whilst visiting Catania War Cemetery and I feel that I made a very good choice. We were greeted by a beautiful and charming lady at reception who made us very welcome and ensured that we had all the informaton we required to get he most out of our stay. Our rooms were very comfortable and spotlessly clean with a comfortable bed, a fridge, colour TV (all programmes in Italian) and a bathroom with all toiletries. The room was serviced every day - even on Sunday ! A splendid buffet breakfast was served in the morning with unlimited food and drinks. The hotel is set in a nice green garden with mature trees giving shade and everything is kept very tidy. To the front of the hotel is a swimming pool and a sunbathing area, a nice place to relax. The hotel restaurant offers lunch and dinner but with a limited menu so we found a wider choice in a local restaurant. The Hotel Le Dune is located just 50 yards from the beach however the public beach is rather dirty and rubbish strewn. Fortunately, the lovely lady in reception gave us a ticket to access the private Lido Arcobaleno so we were able to use that and all its facilities. Overall, I would describe Le Dune as a nice, quiet, peaceful, three - star hotel offering all the amenities a traveller could require. It is ideally located for exploring the island of Sicily and a superb destination for a short break in the sun. I will definately return.","17001":"I stopped here due to some airport issues.  The taxi ride here from the airpirt was short and affordable 10 euros. The front desk staff was nice and accommodating.  I was a little dissapointed with the room, they gave me one that is a bit of a walk from the nicely groomed reception area, through a gravel parking lot and in front of a the YMCA tennis courts. The room its self was very simple, and had minimal linens on the bed. On the bright side, it was clean on the inside and the bathroom shower was nice.  If you are looking to walk from here to town, its about a mile through busy streets, i woukd not recommend it.  The resturaunt was very nice. The menu was properly suzed food was top notch, and service was on point.  Long and short of it.... if you looking for a place to stay over night close to the airport, this is a good selection. If you are looking to tour the city i would think about choosing a,place closer to town.","17004":"Don't be fooled by the pictures... Trash hotel, spread out - with no thought for hauling luggage, impossible to park unless you are on a bike, walls paper thin, everything creaks, unspeakable breakfast  The worst - 6th century BC air conditioner from Greco-Roman times creaks like a tractor all night - doesn't cool - try sleeping through that This was October - so we could afford to switch off. In summer, I would submerge in pool  ONLY plus - close to airport But so is the runway Bad end to fab holiday in Sicily","17006":"We were pleasantly surprised with the hotel which was in between some rather run down buildings. The rooms were clean and the staff were super. The breakfast which was included was really good. American coffee was available but you could also order cappuccinos. The beach is over the road, but the pool is lovely so we swam there instead","17007":"We arrived late at Catania Airport and chose Le Dune Sicily Hotel because of its proximity to the Airport. The hotel is basic - no frills - but ok. Restaurant closed at 10pm which is quite unusual for Italy. Breakfast however quite large for Italian standard. Staff not very friendly. To get to the beach you have to cross busy road.","17044":"Thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Room C and terraces were stunning, great views of sea, city, Etnea. Pepa welcomed us warmly and was most accomodating! Location in center of city and steps from bus stop..... highly recommend!","17046":"Clean and cosy B&B in the center of Catania, not far from the Busstation \u201eArchi (Via Cardinale Dusmet)\u201c, where the airportbus stops. The reservation was very uncomplicated.  We were warmly welcomed with coffee and compote on the roof terrace with a spectacular view on the Duomo, Mount Etna and the sea. Here we enjoyed with the other guests our rich breakfest (ham, cheese, frech fruits, yoghurt, croissant, coffee, juice). Guests have always access to the roof terrace and so we enjoyed also our wine in the evening there.  We had also a private balcony, which had a nice view on the sea and the harbour. Pepa, the landlady, was very kind and helpful! We enjoyed meeting her so much! From the B&B you can vistit the interesting spots per foot: the Duomo with the elefant fountain, the fish market, Via Crociferi and Via Etnea are just a few minutes away.  Since we took our train in the afternoon we could leave our luggage after checking out in the B&B. Because of the location it can be a little noisy in the night. But we did not have any issues with falling asleep.  We highly recommend the B&B and would love to come back! Thanks f\u00fcr everything,  Franziska and Manuela","17048":"Great location, right in the heart of the historical center of Catania. Has a big roof terrace with amazing view of Mt Etna. Very good service and friendly staff. A place i would definitely recommend.","17064":"When we arrived, there was no sign on door or way to know how to buzz to get in. Owners don't live there, so arrange your arrival time in advance and hope you can figure out how to buzz in. We had to ask to borrow a stranger's cellphone to call the owner's daughter to let us in when we were at the door. Taxi driver was helpful and stood around until it was all settled.  The room was small, but decent and modern. A nice bathroom was across the hall from our room, so it could be a bit awkward even though you don't share. There is a fan, but no air-conditioning and it was a bit too warm in Oct. at night. The room is a few feet from the road and it was extremely noisy. I found 3 little bugs in my bed on the third and last night. That ruined a good night's sleep. Looked ominously like bed bugs to me and I was up half the night checking. One of the other guests had bite marks all over her lower legs, but who knows if that was related. We informed the owners of the problem and showed them one of the bugs I had killed. I'm sure they intended to resolve the issue properly although they made up some lame excuse about bugs flying in through the window (these bugs had no wings).  Owners were there only on the weekend and they made a good breakfast. Their daughter, Silvia, is there during the week. They were very helpful in answering our sightseeing questions and the owner drove us to the bus station, which was very nice, but I would have preferred some offer of compensation for the sleep lost.","17085":"stayed here for 2 nights and this place is great value and great location! We had a nice room with a small little balcony. Breakfast is served at the terrace which has an amazing view of Mount Etna, as long as there are no clouds. The lady in charge of the facilities is lovely and super helpful! Really enjoyed my stay in this place. At first it was a little bit difficult to find as it's located on the top floor inside an apartment building. Couldn't really find signage outside, overall this place is great.","17091":"This is a great hotel, conveniently located. Everything was spotlessly clean, and modern. Fantastic breakfast, with so much choice. Staff were polite and helpful. Everything just perfect. Will definitely stay here again.","17096":"every time we find a place to stay that has great location, service and price we entitle the review with YOU WON or some variation of that which we admit is a little cheesy but in this three second attention span world of readers viewing lodging websites, seems necessary to grab your attention and consider a place. We see the last english language review is October 2014 which seems understandable since many of our fellow guests were Europeans..  Just a few words about Catania...if you are just using it just as a place to land in Sicily and then jump on a bus, or rent a car, to go elsewhere and not explore this baroque town....biiiigggg mistake!....We don't have the time to convince anyone here...I invite you to reconsider and do the research work.(not adequately captured in most popular travel guides)..Catania has at least two great things going for it...it is centrally located for buses, planes, trains to anywhere in Sicily and also is easily within 3-5 days on its own...and the food and prices are, as crazy eddie used to say, insane (hello older new yorkers) ...oh yeah, almost every building is baroque, unique, an opera for the eyes, the streets are safe, the fish market is something you will never forget, the city is alive all night with carousing students, wonderful little streets and stores, but you can only know if you know...take a chance, you'll find out....we had 12 daysb in sicily...which is another important piece of advice we can give...if you are staying in Sicily less than 10 days, first reconsider...or at least don't try to do so much...you'll be too rushed and second , you won't have the time to stroll and devil may care where wedon't have to catch a bus, etc and not be on a stressed timetable or else perhaps Catania is not for you...  Second, San Placido Band B....thank you so much Valentina, Orazio and Alana...what wonderful hosts...you want your breakfast each morning on a very, very large rooftop patio overlooking etna, the churches and town, which of course is included in the price of your room...you want to linger on that patio at dusk and watch the colors change over etna while being serenaded by church bells (and church GONGS!)...you want to walk through a small, cozy and fancifully decorated Band B that makes you stop every few paces to consider a painting, lithograph, object or other eye delight...a place located in the building that was reportedly (by one guidebook)a location of the 1960 movie starring Marcello Mastroianni and Claduia Cardinale ( (Il Bell' Antonio)  ...anyway, there is no need to go on and on here...the place is well known to europeans and deservedly popular...but judging from the last English posting of October 2014, we just wanted to put it more on the map for visitors from the other side of the pond...sorry to give you more work Valentina...  Thank you so much....Billy and Karen","17115":"This hotel, located centrally in Palermo nevertheless has a side street calm to it. The young lady at the desk had class, friendliness and was helpful in resolving a minor charge glitch. The Hotel Ambasciatore, filled up at the time cheerfully recommended the Sitano which is an 8 minute walk away from it. Like most Italian hotels there is a plethora of marble modern, and the breakfast room is decorated with cultural artifacts. You will love this place. We were on a Rick Steves tour. No car.","17122":"I\u2019ve read some reviews of this hotel and do not understand the negative opinions. Our room is quite comfortable (junior suite) with a king sized bed and small sitting area. Two doors opening onto balcony\u2019s provide quite lot of light. The staff is welcoming and quite helpful in suggesting sites to see and places to eat in the area. The breakfast buffet has a nice, large variety of options and a light, airy room in which to eat. As noted in other reviews, the shower temperature control is a little tricky, but with some experimentation we had plentiful hot water. There is construction noise in the area , but we do not really mind as we are early risers. The location is just perfect. Almost everything we wanted to see is within a 15 minute walk. We will definitely stay here if we come to Palermo again.","17126":"We were disappointed with this hotel. The lobby area is strangely laid out and not very comfortable. The staff are bordering on unfriendly and definitely unhelpful. The bar area is empty and rarely staffed. However our bedroom was wonderful and like a mini-suite with a nice view over the street (a bit noisy). But... the coffee machine didn't work and when I asked for tea there was no room service or any way to get a cup of tea. I wouldn't recommend it - even though it is well located and did a decent breakfast - but again with very unhelpful staff.","17128":"Palermo is a vibrant city. This hotel is located on a pedestrian commercial street. Restaurants, bars and shops are all on your doorstep here. A grocery store is around the corner. A five minute walk takes you to the harbour where you can walk along in both directions. Good A C and good shower in my room, which are my necessities in addition to location.","17131":"Light challenged is not only issue with this hotel. Don't expect smiles or greetings when you check in. Our first room had fan but no ac. Only rooms with ac have mini split. No central air. Strange layout. Did I mentioned very dark? One positive was well located. Can probably do better for the money.","17139":"Clean and friendly, the hotel is in the centre of life in Palermo. The street outside and those around are filled with places to eat and drink and stalls selling goods and Sicilian street food. On Saturday night they were full of people just walking around or enjoying the local food and drink and the atmosphere is really enjoyable. Our room overlooked the street and a background noise existed until gone 01.00hrs as people were still enjoying the atmosphere (I saw more than one couple with a pushchair at this time) but this did not stop us from sleeping when we turned in. The breakfast was plentiful but not really that good but there are plenty of places outside where you can eat for a reasonable price. As ever in Italy remember to take a kettle and coffee tea as they are not in the room.","17143":"We were part of a tour so this hotel was chosen for us. To be fair we were warned about the dark rooms & it wouldn't be a deal breaker to us but there's really no excuse as all they needed was a decent central light. There were very few sockets for charging either. The rest of the hotel wasn't as poorly lit & the decor was modern & to my taste. The bathroom was Ok but a little compact as the door would hit you if you were standing at the wash basin. There was a spacious walk in wardrobe with a safe. We had back rooms so they were very quiet as the location is great, on a main street. Consequently everything was easily walkable including the harbour, main attractions & restaurants. The wi-fi was unsecure but stable.","17149":"If you want something that has it all, then this is the place stay. Staff exceptional, rooms great and breakfast selection vast. You can't go hungry here. Every day something different. You can use this place as base and travel around. I place I would some back to.","17150":"The hotel is situated in the city center, on a main pedestrian street inaccessible by cars except for taxis and buses. The main floor is fine, the front desk  receptionist acting already tired of tourists in spite of our stay in May. Our room was disappointing; the carpet was spotted, soiled and threadbare by too many attempts to clean. Seriously needed replacement. The dinner-seafood pasta, was tepid. The 4 star rating must have happened some time long ago. I would look elsewhere if I were to return to Palermo.","17159":"This accommodation is in an old palazzo, and looks absolutely gorgeous, if you like historical buildings. If you want a slick room painted white, this is not for you. The rooms are a bit worn out, but the suite we stayed in was in a good condition and I felt like a noble myself. The only means of heating was the air conditioner, which made air a bit too dry. There was plenty of space and the service was kind and cool. The location is optimal, in the middle of the city but also on a quiet street (you can close the wooden inner windows).","17160":"The location is perfect, is close to port and city center and the hotel is located in a cute street with lots of street food. The Staff is extremely nice. Rooms are clean and comfortable. The hotel\u2019s building is renovated ancient building, which makes it unique and beautiful. The breakfast was amazing, lots of local food and sweets. There is all kind of food that you can imagine for a breakfast. The price is reasonable.","17162":"I moved here at short notice having found the accommodation I'd booked in Catania was unsuitable. I found the hosts, Serafina and Carlos, kind and attentive. The house is absolutely wonderful - the drawing room in the picture looks even better in real life. I had a huge triple bedroom with a large ensuite shower room all to myself at a very reasonable rate. The location is about as good as it gets - just of Via Etnea, five minutes walk from the Duomo and Fish Market, two minutes walk to the bus for the airport. Heavy shutters kept out any noise from the street. Wholeheartedly recommend.","17163":"The service was excellent and proactive at the hotel, with Carlo arranging a very reasonably-priced taxi to and from the airport. The room was huge, with a stunning stucco celing; the bathroom was very modern. Situated just off Via Etnea, the hotel was very central but also very quiet. We'll definitely be staying here again.","17164":"This is a great place to stay. The level of service starts before you arrive. Carlo was very helpful and his English is great. He knows everything you will need for your trip. We will definitely stay here next time we go to Catania.","17168":"A great guest house in the centre of Catania, large high ceiling room with a good on suite bathroom. Easy walking distance to just about all central sites. No in room tea  coffee but there are facilities for this outside the reception area, hot water takes a while to come through the shower. These are minor gripes overall this is a friendly little guest house right in the heart of vibrant Catania- enjoy!","17170":"This is rated as a two star hotel. Given there is no such thing as a no star hotel and one star is not much more than camping, I truly think it deserves more. OK it doesn\u2019t have room service but it is very central, clean, comfortable, with good air con and you should see the reception room. Oh Wowzer. We have a room with en-suite bathroom. The little fridge minibar doesn't make a noise ... have an extra star for that. There is parking in the street outside the hotel but we were advised to leave our car in a nearby car park overnight - 5 minute walk. They do not serve breakfast but there are local eateries nearby that do.","17184":"The description of the hotel above states light and airy. This hotel is neither light nor airy. The rooms are dark with no natural light. The only light in the room is a giant round lamp which uses the only plug in the room. So if you want to charge your phone you have to live in darkness. There is only that one plug point in the room. There is also no wifi signal in the room. In the lobby the wifi does not connect either. The phone in the room does not work so in an emergency you have no way of getting help. The area around the hotel is dodgy and I felt unsafe walking on my own at night. The reception managers were not helpful when trying to address wifi issues etc with them. The only helpful person was the maintenance man called Milo. This is definitely not a 4 star hotel. I would not recommend this hotel no matter how many stars it has.","17188":"Very fancy entry room. old building with spacious rooms with high ceilings. The location was nice for walking to many nice restaurants and interesting sights. We paid less than $75.00 with 3 Euro added at the hotel.","17190":"Stayed here as part of a tour group and after 3 nights I was happy to be leaving. The hotel is in a good location being close to restaurants and the marina but other aspects of the hotel are poor.  The breakfast was terrible as there was clearly not enough food to cater for the number of people. Management should consider providing more food during peak breakfast times. The choices were limited to start with but there wasn\u2019t enough food during the 3 times I had breakfast.  The room was modern but was very dark as all furnishings are dark brown or black. The bedroom and bathroom were very small and quite uncomfortable. The lack of tissues was very annoying and was the only hotel in Italy I stayed at where they weren\u2019t provided. The oversized table lamp could not be turned off unless it was unplugged and I couldn\u2019t plug my appliances in the power point because the lamp was in the way.  During my stay, there was no hot water for over 24 hours due to a broken pipe. Thankfully it was summer but there was no advice from management about this maintenance issue. My tour director was kind enough to follow this matter up directly with the hotel.  I only had one dinner in the hotel and it was certainly the worst meal of my trip to Italy.  There is a terrace on the third floor which was sunny and quite pleasant if not for the staff who were out there smoking.","17192":"Very dark rooms. A weird conversion that does not work eg bar entirely in the wrong place. Our room was big so a plus but was not cleaned properly ( sink and bath) after the first night. Fridge had no glasses despite having a mini bar. The 2 plastic cups ( for teeth or drinking?) were of the type that when squeezed they broke. Not replaced . the room had no tissues. Breakfast was average jam was in syrup containers , awful stuff and the scramble egg seemed rubbery and not freshly made. You got the impression it was all bout saving a penny? dollar where possible. However a nice welcome drink and nibbles on arrival. was also close to many nice eateries , maybe why Titan use it. Perhaps the most disturbing thing is the design of the bath. The taps come out 3 4 inches at eye level for shorter people with the hand held shower to wash your hair in front. My wife just brushed the taps at eye level when leaning back .Needs removing from the tour.","17193":"We stumbled on this place by complete accident...and now it is our go to place! I love the food, especially the bar...and VERY friendly courteous staff. You will not be disappointed...5 stars. Southern Italian fair...food is absolutely fantastic. Highly recommended","17196":"Stayed for 2 nights as part of Titan tour Central position so easy for walking and sight seeing in Palermo Good room and very clean though furnishings and decor made room dark Only had breakfast in this hotel though staff didn\u2019t have this fully available for our early starts on tour Not much fresh fruit available but generally ok","17198":"Stayed here for 2 nights on our  Jewel of the Mediterranean  tour by Titan Travel from the UK.  Ok but nothing special. Bedroom was quite small, a funny shape and little useable space to locate a second suitcase. On the other hand, the bathroom was big. All appeared to be clean. The whole hotel had an unusual layout, presumably converted from its original use in an imaginative way.  Buffet breakfast somewhat disorganised : mediocre choice and some basic items late in coming out, for example bread only appeared about 20 minutes after opening.","17201":"This hotel is on the first and second floors of what is an old, historic building. Getting in and out was a bit like Fort Knox with its key code system but works once you know how to do it. The staff were friendly. There was a fridge in the room with a free drink, wifi, a hairdryer and air conditioning. The main advantage is its central location.","17203":"I styed one night. The room was very clean and hd aprivate bath outside. There ws a frige with free drinkks plus coffee and tea. Location ner via atnea makes it perfect for shopping. The lobby and office are amazing. Friendly and helpful staff. Low price. There are more expensive and luxerius rooms","17205":"Instantly welcoming with clean, large rooms and updated bathrooms. Convenient to the major tourist attractions. Loved that it was in a historic building and in a neighborhood where there were many good restaurants and cafes.","17207":"I would look for another hotel in Palermo. On our second night here, there was water poring from the ceiling in our bathroom. The telephones in the rooms do not work, so we had to go down to the front desk to report it. There was only one guy manning the desk. No one else was on duty or available. No housekeeping. No manager. Nothing. At first he did not believe us, so we made him come up to the room to look. In fact he said we were lying. That is not possible. He came upstairs to look and didn\u2019t know what to do. He went back to the front desk since he was all alone. After 20 minutes I went back down and still no solution or assistance. I made a big fuss and asked him call someone. He did, but they spoke in Italian on the phone, so I am not sure what happened. I was informed that there were no other rooms available in the hotel. We ended up taking a bucket from the housekeeping closet on our floor and a bunch of towels to clean up the mess. The next morning the front desk still didn\u2019t care and the manager was still not available. There was no compensation. There was no compassion or customer service. We ended up leaving the hotel.","17208":"Former home of a baron. We had room 7 which was very regal. The lounge is just beautiful, bit like a National Trust house. The shower was a little dated but ok. Breakfast was typical continental, no cheese or ham though. Booked as part of a package holiday. Balcony overlooks the main street, so some noise. Air conditioned.","17209":"We stayed for one night and could happily have stayed longer. It\u2019s in a perfect central location. Quirky and interesting with large spacious rooms, modern bathroom and small balcony. Excellent value for money.","17210":"A lot of positive characteristics: the building, a old restored and fascinating palace; the position, close to the cala and the main attractions and restaurants; comfortable and clean rooms; abundant and well assorted breakfast; kind staff. To be improved: very weak wi-fi; low brightness in the rooms.","17215":"The hotel is well located - a few minutes walk to the duomo and to the fish market. The airport bus is just a few blocks away. Staff were friendly and helpful. I had the room with the private external bathroom and while it was a bit inconvenient to go down and around the hall for the bathroom, the price made it a good value. I liked having the balcony and the air conditioning. Overall, I would recommend it for the price, cleanliness and location.","17216":"Stayed here last week for 2 nights as part of a Titan tour. The tour manager told us we had been allocated quiet rooms around the inner courtyard. My husband and I were the unlucky exception though and were on the main street. On entering the room we couldn't switch the lights on so we blundered around with a phone torch and discovered the 3 lights were all unplugged, it didn't make much difference when they were on though as everything in the room is dark brown, the walls are brown, the bedding and curtains are brown the furniture is brown, even the toilet paper (recycled) is brown. You need a torch to see the safe in the wardrobe. That night the boom boom boom from the bar opposite made sleep impossible. At 3am we went down to complain, the guy on front desk shrugged his shoulders and said there were no other rooms available and to ask in the morning. We asked in the morning and the woman on reception said no rooms were available and when we said about the noise she laughed and said it would be even noisier tonight! She wasn't wrong, that night was awful as Saturday night is karaoke night! Another sleepless night ensued. Had I not been on a tour I would have demanded my money back. This hotel is one of the worst it's ever been my misfortune to stay at.","17218":"We have just spent two nights here as part of a Titan tour. The room was large and very clean but rather dark because of dark furniture and furnishings. Lots of hot water and clean white towels. Breakfast was efficiently served with a reasonable choice of cakes, bread and cereal but limited supplies of fresh fruit and juices. The hotel did not appear to have a restaurant but the hotel is in the main street where there are plenty of bars,cafes and restaurants within walking distance. The hotel is well placed for sight seeing. Reception staff very helpful. Altogether a pleasant experience.","17221":"We only stayed in Catania for a night but what a great place. Traffic and parking in Catania are insane so getting there was an adventure but once we got there we were quite taken by the house itself and the especially the room. The bathroom was down the hall but private. Plenty of great restaurants in the area. Old world charm for a great price.","17224":"Stayed just one night (room 3). Loved it straight away \u2013 the room was nice and big (c. 30 metres square), spotlessly clean, comfortable bed (one big double that I slept in, and there was also a single bed in there), old style furniture, and a reasonable price. Nice touch: a selection of free 'welcome drinks' in the fridge (still and sparkling water and a couple of soft drinks).  Quick and efficient check in (they emailed ahead to ask what time I'd be there \u2013 Reception closes at 22h) and check out, and then I was able to leave my bag there while I went around the city.  When I came back to get the bag I asked if they could order me a cab to the bus station. T \u2013 the cab company phone line was busy so he kindly drove me to the bus station \u2013 and answered all my questions about the history of the place on the way.  Above and beyond :))","17225":"We had a great stay. The place is 4 blocks from Elephant Square with plenty of food and sights within walking distance. Location is also good for shopping. The room was very clean and spacious. Checkin and Checkout were easy and the manager arranged a cab for us since we had quite early morning flight. This is definately a place we would return to.","17227":"Compared to other charming destinations in eastern Sicily, such as Taormina and Ortegia in Siracusa, we were not expecting to find such a pleasant surprise as this tiny two-star hotel just off the upscale, pedestrian-friendly avenue of Via Etna. This was a local Baron's city residence, and we stayed in his former office with a frescoed ceiling and balcony. We enjoyed art galleries in nearby streets, decent open-air restaurants, and evening strolls with the locals after dinner. The other reviews are right to describe Il Gattopardo as magical and friendly. It is also quirky ... but in a good way. For example, the thoughtful and professional owners let us store some excess luggage for several days while we took a long side trip. But remember, this is not really a hotel in the usual sense, and therefore offers clearly limited services. That was fine with us. As a foreigner, you'll enjoy Il Gattopardo more if you have been in Italy for a while and want a reasonably priced place with great vibes. Feels like you're back in an earlier time. If you like literature, bring an English translation of the classic Sicilian historical novel The Leopard (Il Gattopardo) to read while you're staying here. We'll be here again the next time we're in Catania.","17228":"gattopardo house is quirky but stunning with its beautiful lounge and we had an amazing room 11 with fresco ceiling. Great location for exploring Catania. Helpful reception staff who advised us where to go and ordered us a taxi for airport run. It would be great to serve drinks in the lounge area as seems such a shame that it is not really used. Great stay. Would recommend! Shops are on via etnea and lots of great cafes and bars. Glamour bar does great food and drinks with a lovely atmosphere. Pizzas are huge at al vicola!","17229":"Very kind and helpful people running this place. It is very well located close to everything in town. The rooms are a lot bigger than expected and everything functioned as expected. I can\u2019t possibly fault this place which I have come to enjoy quite a lot. I look to my return to this place on my next visit to Catania.","17234":"This place is not the normal hotel, in fact i seem to recall there is a note somewhere within in the place that says 'this is not a hotel'. I am certainly glad it was such a different place, the room was huge and with great character, they told me that the house belong to the aristocracy from the XVIII and yes i could see the style. The situation could not be better, in the centre, close to all bars and shops and even to the airport bus. The staff so kind and attentive I loved it!","17236":"We stayed there two different times, the first time we had a most fantastic corner room with decorated ceilings, and great ambience, two balconies.The second time we had a plain room. It's a jungle to find your room - as there are different floors. We were there with a group from GAdventures. Lovely lobby and meeting room with over the top decorations and furniture. Small elevator. Staff was very helpful and friendly. Breakfast was available.","17237":"The Gattopardo house is a charming family run hotel. It is conveniently situated in historic centre of Catania and very near to Piazza Stersicoro, where the bus from  to the airport stops. The building is an historic grand town house with frescoed ceilings and a great baroque feeling for which Catania is renowned for. The rooms have historic feature which make up for the lack of luxury. The hotel is very clean, it has free wi-fi, air conditioning and the rooms have a little fridge with complimentary soft drinks offered at arrival. The owners are polite and helpful. This establishment is very reasonably priced and conveniently located for exploring Catania. It has also an excellent aperitif bar just around the corner. A good choice overall.","17284":"The hotel is in what looks like a rough area but was brilliantly convenient for all the main sights and the railway station. Everywhere within 15 minutes walk. The reception staff were very friendly and helpful. Breakfast was good. Room was very pleasant and a bit quirky. Ours had like an indoor garden with a perspex roof but had chairs so like an extra lounge. I would recommend it.","17292":"Great place to stay, in the city center of Catania, a few minutes away from Bellini theater and via Etnea, one of the Main Streets of Catania. You have several restaurants nearby, with amazing food. Great service and attention! The girl from the reception was very nice and helpful. 5 stars! Would definitely recommend this place. Have in mind it is an old hotel, but nice and clean.","17294":"The hotel provided everything for convenient stay in Catania: very good location in the old part of Catania, tasty breakfast, cozy and clean room and friendly staff. The only drawback: there is no lift in the hotel building.","17295":"+ central location, difficulty finding parking spaces in the area + large and clean bathroom, very hot water + large and comfortable bed + decent breakfast + English is spoken, helpful and friendly staff + 15 minutes walk to the railway station and 5 minutes to the city center  - hotel located in an old building without an elevator,must claim the stares up to the second level of the building - the view of the room was to the street, a lot o noise from the cars on scooters who were on the street (we have not been able to sleep all night)","17307":"This was a budget option in Catania, and we were impressed with the hotel. The reception was helpful and welcoming. The room was very impressive with a wonderful large well kept bathroom. Our room was a little strange in that the double bed (but with separate mattresses) had to be reached via some steep stairs in the room, but once they were conquered this attend to the uniqueness of the place. A simple cold breakfast was also included, which was a bonus. Wifi reception was of limited use in the room.","17336":"Poor English by staff. Our room was #108. Ragged walls, noisy A C, the room itself was very dark. Only bathroom was fine. Breakfast is supposed to be served from 7 a.m. however when we came at 8, there was nobody and reception guy was sleeping. He told us that he's late, but that's not a problem. Of course, we decided to have breakfast in a cafe close by. In general, I would not recommend this hotel, you can find better for this price quality ratio.","17370":"Room was large and clean (i had the room with a balcony & private bathroom) Ivana was very helpful she booked the Etna tour for me & even managed to get me a ticket for the bus to the airport. breakfast was adequate french toast, cereal, cake bar., coffee the only problem was the noise at night (next time I'd bring earplugs) but being so close to the nightlife what do you expe would I stay there again easy answer .. Yes  Very friendly atmosphere and I felt safe & welcomed","17382":"This is a clean and basic stay. It is well located close to everything but the streets are typical of Catania ( dirty and neglected). Catania has some wonderful treasures but you need to get over the shock of the grotty streetscape. We did not quite appreciate the quirky decor of this place.","17384":"We truly enjoyed our stay at Palazzu Stidda and enjoyed the warm hospitality of Patricia and Giovanni. The Palazzu itself is a stunner, and we loved what Patricia and Giovanni had done with it - beautiful details and interior all around. We want to return to Palazzu for warmer weather to sit in the balcony and enjoy the wonderful terrace. The Palazzu is warm and cosy in the winter though and we loved the off season experience in Catania. Palazzu\u2019s location is very good!  Thank you Patricia and Giovanni!","17388":"Totally enjoyed my stay at Palazzu Stidda. Great neighborhood; close to major sites; restaurants & bus train transportation.The apartment is so comfortable and attractive I didn\u2019t want to leave. Highly recommend!!!","17389":"My partner and I stayed in Catania for 2 days and we based our visit at Palazzu Stidda. Great location, and very good apartment. Giovanni, our host was very helpful to give us information about places to visit and to eat in Catania. He also suggested other B&B where we could stay in other Sicilian locations. The apartment is not cheap also considering that breakfast is not included and we went in low season yet it was worth the money!","17401":"We were 2 couples traveling together and stayed just one night, coming to the apartment from the airport rather late at night. Our taxi driver followed the instructions that the warm and charming owner, Giovanni had given us. He also had given us clear directions on how to access the apartment and included photos of the corner of the street. My communication with Giovanni beforehand was flawless. He stopped in when we were leaving and we had a long and fascinating conversation in French and English. The large and lovely apartment is a 5 minute walk from the fish market and the piazza del Duomo, perfectly situated. I highly recommend the Piazza Stidda without hesitation.","17403":"Comming to the end of our weeks stay and must say have been plesently suprised. The apartment is stylishly fitted out with very unique furniture and fillings, almost like living in a museum. The owners have taken their time fitting out the place. Centrally situated in Catania close to everything. Booking a pleasure all went fine and gave us lots of help getting here and away. For me this is a 5 Star place.","17406":"Warm welcome and support during our stay by Giovanni, beautiful furnished rooms, great facilities for recreation, close to the city (all can be reached in walking distance), especially the option to go to the fishmarket in early morning","17412":"The flat is very charming with lots of nice details. It\u2019s very well equipped and functional. The hosts are very friendly and helpful. The flat is perfectly clean. The common terrace is a perfect place to have dinner or relax. Nearby there\u2019s everything you need. The fish market is amazing.","17419":"Our entire time in Catania was a bit of a fairy tale. We were immediately struck with the warmth that Giovanni and Patricia showed us. Our apartment was delightful and appointed with all the right things. The location is so perfect that you can immediately begin exploring. It always felt like coming home as we approached the building. When we said our good byes we cried a little. All the best to this beautiful family!","17461":"We booked BB22 because of the positive reviews. We were put in the apartment at 11 Bandiera. Our room was tiny with a hard, small double bed. It had no windows, just small skylights in the room and bathroom. There was no shampoo, the shower was broken and didn\u2019t drain and the air conditioner barely worked. All night, we were woken by drunken people on the streets yelling and by the hard bed. The room was so small that our cases hardly fitted in. It really felt like a 1 2 star hotel and a backpackers hostel. The host was friendly but it didn\u2019t make up for it. Beware: it doesn\u2019t look anything like the photos.","17463":"We spent 4nights in the B&B in late September. The first room we were given was not at all suitable as it was still extremely hot in Palermo & the A C was noisy & ineffectual. Rodi(the manager of the property) quickly found us a more suitable room. We had also been traveling for many weeks so it was lovely of her to allow me to use their laundry(little things make trips more enjoy able)..Rodi also offered to help us walk our luggage to the ferry on our departure as the Pope was in town & we were told we wouldn\u2019t be able to find a taxi(extremely kind of her!). The owner was also lovely, gave us lots of information on Palermo.....As stated in other reviews there can be stairs to some of the rooms, although we did have a lift as well. Best to check on booking. The location is great, breakfast, simple but just fine.","17469":"The location and the room was perfectly adequate although there is no lift so not suitable for those unable to manage stairs. I was disappointed with the lack of communication when the power was cut off for almost 8 hours. The reception is not manned in the afternoon but with a situation such as a power black out it would have been nice if a staff member could have kept guests updated on the situation. My other dissapointment is there honesty bar where you actually have to pay to make yourself a cup of tea or coffee and there are no tea and coffee making facility in the rooms. After enduring no power I was quite shocked to then be charged for making myself a cup of tea. A nice apology gesture surely could have been a complimentary cup of tea.","17487":"Location in the heart of old Palermo is very evocative; tucked to the side of a tiny piazza a short distance from San Domenico, it can be hard to find on the first try, but is surrounded by the streets and vicolos that can only be found in Palermo. Beds, towels, showers are all clean comfortable. Staff very friendly and most spoke at least some English. Costanza was a standout with very helpful tips. BB22's laundry service was super affordable at 15 euros for wash dry fold. Only tiny criticism: breakfast was ample, but it isn't available until 8:30 (early risers are out of luck), and it's mostly supermarket-grade stuff. A tiny bit more effort to have local products (jam, honey, ricotta, pastries) would have been the cherry on top. Note: no elevator, quite long flights of stairs make this place unsuitable for mobility challenged, unfit, or those lugging ridiculously large suitcases.","17490":"This is a well run and very quiet hotel. The rooms are large and clean - bed was ok. The breakfast is good and the staff are kind and helpful. The hotel is perfectly located in town and everything is close to walk to.","17497":"This is a well appointed B&B in central Palermo. There are two restaurants, one excellent, and a bar within about 50 yards of the door. What more do you want?  We stayed here twice in quick succession. Both rooms were comfortable, decent mattresses, good showers, good size. One had a balcony. Breakfast was good, fairly typical Italian stuff.  There is an upstairs sitting room for guests with an honesty bar, very jolly. The staff are charming and helpful.  If you want a B&B in Palermo, don't hesitate to book here. There are almost certainly cheaper B&Bs available, but this one is delightful.","17504":"Arrived on September 9th after a very long drive from Naples. After struggling to find BB22 which is tucked in an alleyway we proceeded to unload our car. To our disappointment there was no elevator and our rooms were on the third floor where we had to lug our bags to. The fact that they do not have an elevator was never disclosed on their website and is a bit deceptive. When we asked where to park our car they told us we needed to park it in a garage 300 meters away for 15 Euros day. When it came time to enjoy a cocktail they never had any ice and the breakfast was a bit underwhelming. We paid 180Euros night for 2 nights which based on the amenities is very over priced compared to other hotels in Palermo. Before you decide to book BB22 make sure you look at other options with better value. BB22 is tops not worth more than 135 Euros night compared to what other hotels in Palermo can offer you. I was very underwhelmed.","17513":"We stayed her at the end of our trip to Sicily. The rooms are stylish and well-appointed. The common space is fantastic. Our hostess could not have been more kind and helpful. And we loved the location.","17532":"We stayed for a long weekend at the tail-end of the summer season (Sep 2016). Tucked away in a quiet street corner BB22 is in simply the perfect location for quickly getting around the city on foot or easy access to restaurants, cafe's, bars, the harbour and transport. Parking while not the covered space we expected is just a few meters away in a quiet(ish) square. We had the first floor suite which was gorgeous - simply furnished with shabby chic and lovely minimalist feel, nice sheets, comfy bed and heaps of space! Loved the small walk-in wardrobe. The owners have thought of everything a visitor might need, except perhaps tea drinkers, but no problem because the small dining room upstairs has a honour bar, snacks and a cute covered balcony room. We loved that you're left on your own to treat the house as your home - the small team is only on-site at breakfast or when you need help getting in when you arrive! Breakfast was simple (continental) but plenty to get you started. Would definitely stay here again!","17533":"Our rooms were fine; although the hot water in my shower did not work and I showered down the hall, despite paying for a suite. Breakfast was cold and the exactly the same each day but the coffee was good. Yes it's a B&B but no is English spoken; they forgot to leave my key to the room, as arranged; it took an expensive call to find someone (not so easy) to bring a key to my room. The price of this B&B was akin to a hotel so we had higher expectations. May be a good choice for weathly, Italian-speaking Millenials.","17535":"So it took numerous attempts to find the place and when we did we were at the wrong venue! Our room was within an unmarked apartment complex with 5 different keys required to gain entry. Our room was clean and functional. But no breakfast was available as we had to depart by 7.30am. The location was central and we could walk to the main attractions. Would I recommend, probably not if you want a room with a view and an easy to find location.","17538":"Stayed at Fladi for 2 weeks in July. Such a lovely place to stay. Very clean, coffee and hot water available. Location ideal for restaurants and shopping. Diletta was very accommodating for any requests we had. The cafe for breakfast in theatre square was lovely too. Would recommend and definitely stay again.","17545":"Big rooms,nice new furniture and mattress,modern bathroom.There are lockers where you can leave your things after check out.We loved breakfast served at nearby cafes,fresh and delicious.Belini opera is just around the corner and there are a lot of nice restaurants in the neighborhood.There are a bottles of water in the fridge and some sweets in the room.Hosts are very nice and price is good.Thank you Fladi house for a wonderful stay in a beautiful Catania","17547":"We were so happy to find this small hotel in central Catania. It is very new and very comfortable with a helpful and friendly staff. The exterior entrance may worry you because it is an old building but Fladi\u2019s rooms on the second floor are totally remodeled and very modern. It is a great location, easy walk to centro, fish market, metro, etc. it is extremely secure and seemed perfectly safe walking home at night. We would happily stay there for a third visit.","17560":"In the centre of the town !Very clear and big enough rooms.You are just a minute away from anything tou need in the town ! Also the service of the owner was perfect, we had communication for whatever we needed and always helped us to find out everything we needed !!","17564":"We booked two double deluxe rooms for two nights on September 17, and again for one night on return to Palermo a week later. The first stay was at the beautiful new establishment. We had room 1 by the entrance door and one upstairs. We were warmly welcomed with helpful suggestions for sightseeing and dining. The spacious common areas are excellent. However we discovered when we came back after dinner that the air conditioning was not functioning in either room. Room 1 is a little noisy to begin with due to the water heater located in the bathroom. But we had to sleep with the window to the interior courtyard open for air and a huge and noisy party continued in one of the neighbouring apartments until 5 am. Not much sleep due to heat and noise! We pointed out the problem to the staff the net morning and they had a technician attend while we were out for the day. When we returned, we discovered that the sevice air conditioning still wasn't working in either room. We called the staff who came over and after a lot of commotion to try to fix it, went to great lengths to get the technician back late at night. This time when we returned from dinner it worked. However dedicated staff don't make up for lack of air conditioning in Palermo! On our second visit we were in the Gold room in the original BB22. This time there were no staff and nobody answered either land line or the mobile phone when we had had a problem. This room has a free standing air conditioning unit in the room. We noticed it was set on 13 degrees C. When we turned it on we realized why. It blew a pitiful stream of barely cool air incapable of cooling the room. This clearly was not a temporary breakdown of central air like the first experience. They clearly have a chronic problem that they haven't fixed. We wouldn't recommend staying here unless you've received a guarantee that they have fixed these problems. Light sleepers should then avoid room 1 in the new location.","17581":"This B and B gave us lots of room. Nicely designed. Andrea was great. She brought from her home a scale to weigh our bags before flying out of the airport. We have stayed in many places but this was very much more than good. Shower is a bit small. But so what. Great place.","17583":"We spent only one night here, but were very pleased. Cozy rooms with a lovely desingn and all necessary amenities - balcony, refrigerator, air conditioning. Very tasty and varied breakfast in a nice breakfast room. In every detail you can feel the taste and effort of the owners to make your stay pleasant and unforgettable. Thank you, Angela and Rebecca for professionalism, hospitality and heartiness!","17600":"We went for a weekend stay as a family. Very welcoming staff especially the owners - Angela and Fabio. Gave us tips during our stay and even offerred shuttle services for our excursions. All rooms are very modern including the living area and breakfast area. Super clean ambience including rooms and bathrooms. The matress and pillow were super comfortable and we had a very good night sleep. The breakfast topped up our holiday.. very delicious, fresh and a wide choice for all. Would definitley return to re-visit Catania. Thank you both for making our stay enjoyable.","17616":"Palermo Rooms are in good in good location...5 mins to Via Liberta..and keep going straight to many attractions ,....train bus station,... historical area. etc.,....if you go down you will be in beautiful marina with lots of restaurants nearby! ...about the b and b were very clean..clean towels, clean kitchen which you can go anytime to do your cup of tea or coffee...breakfast was good selections of cakes or toast with a variety of ham...overall I would recommended if you want to stay in Palermo for a few days with a very reasonable price!!","17626":"We Had a great stay in Palermo!!Nice people and very clean and Nice room, good location in a Nice Area I can recommand iT To everyone old and young if you go To Palermo choose this b and b i you Will not regret iT","17630":"I spent my half term holidays in Palermo with my son and we had an amazing time thanks to Fabio's suggestions and tips and his great hospitality. The BB is very central, walking distance from main touristic attractions. It's clean and very good value for money!","17633":"Me and my husband stayed in this this B&B in Palermo during a little tour of Sicily Staff were very friendly and helpful with information regarding restaurants and local attractions. Breakfast was really excellent and much much better quality than we had in many others B&B we have tried. Our room was comfortable specious and light Location is so convenient for walking everywhere in Palermo or catching a bus or a taxi We would definitely stay there again and we would recommend it without hesitation","17646":"The location is excellent and this together with the facilities offered and made a much needed break hassle-free and special. The staff were excellent - very welcoming and courteous. Can't wait to go back.","17648":"Stayed at De Curtis Palace for 7 nights and we were pleasantly surprised. After arriving on a Monday later than expected we took the Alibus from Catania Airport (4 euros per person) and alighted at Catania train station and then we were unsure where to go, so I asked the local Polizia who were very friendly and ensured we got to the B&B as they hadn\u2019t heard of it. One officer even shone the torch on the bell to make sure its was correct - grazie mille. The owner manager was very friendly even if his English - like my Italian - was very limited. Looking from the outside you\u2019re not sure what to expect but inside the room it\u2019s lovely and clean and there was a complimentary savouries coffee on our arrival in the room. The room was cleaned each day and if the towels were left in the shower they were replaced. Not recommended for people who can\u2019t manage stairs, there was 82 up to our room on the second floor! There are no elevators. Breakfast is in a cafe about 2 minute walk from the B&B - you have to get your ticket each day to get your free breakfast which consisted of a coffee tea & a croissant. It was enough to keep you going to lunchtime. It is in quite an interesting area as about 50 metres away is the Red Light district & the women were out during the day & night!!! But they didn\u2019t bother us and the B&B was near the local bus train stations & near local eateries. I would stay there again without hesitation","17654":"Well, they did advertise this hotel as a bed and breakfast. However, the bed was present, and there is no breakfast here! We were sent two blocks away to get some breakfast. The place on the outside was rundown. Look at the pictures on google earth to get the gist of the doors to the hotel, its literally two wooden doors, I thought to myself as the doors open, this is not going to end well, the place looked seedy! Our room was spacious, pleasant and clean, and we had a street view balcony. The amount of doors one has to open to get to your room, let alone the flights of stairs to climb with no elevator. Left a lot to be desired. However, I found the staff pleasant and helpful. This place reminded me of a novice home run business, rather that a real hotel. The cats hanging around the inside of the building stairwell, I think was a blessing, perhaps keeping other rodents away, however the smell, wasn't pleasant! We only stayed one night before departing back home.","17687":"I agree that this B&B lacks a sign in the street so it is a bit complicated to find. At least little sign on the front gates would be a huge help for a tourist.However, did not meet any Italian who would refuse to provide directions (although in Italian), so found it quickly. You can not change the neighborhood but if you want a central place, (few minutes to city center and 8 min to central station) for reasonable price, you are used to multicultural environment and you don't mind it- this is the place. Really liked the room as it was cozy and huge. Was amazed by varity of bathroom supplies provided. Some fine hotels do not provide so many. Place is authentic, not fancy but good for short visit. Not sure about the breakfast cause had fresh cake and coffee in a small cafe not far away.","17735":"This is a family property in the heart of Palermo. Rooms are very clean and spacious, the bed is super comfortable. The ospitality of the two sisters, Silvia and Laura is the best You can find. I would totally reccomend this property and wanna wish the family all the best for the future!  Zinaida&Salvo from Taormina","17754":"Lovely old town house converted into guest house full of character. Central location for getting to main tourist attractions. Comfortable bed. Fridge and kettle in room. Good WIFI. Pleasant service and continental breakfast. Would stay here again!","17833":"These rooms are located through a huge wooden courtyard door that is marked by a plaque. Even though we had the address the Taxi driver walked me around trying to find it but eventually we spotted the sign. You will have to buzz in to get through the outer and then the inner door of the complex. There is a small elevator. The staff is friendly but don\u2019t expect a lot of English. Room was clean with air conditioning and typical of a 3 star accommodation. Breakfast was limited and even though it was included we had some unexplained additional charges associated with it but they weren\u2019t extravagant. Location, The rooms are about 1.2 mi to train station and water port but much closer to restaurants. It\u2019s a good location. If I were to go back I would probably stay closer to the Sant Agata church square in a hotel.","17834":"We spent 5 nights in Hotel Concordia in Palermo.We want to thank you all the staff for our wonderfu stay in Palermo. All the staff is very nice, friendly and available for any questions you may have,always smiling and they support in every moment of your stay. The Hotel is small and cozy, situated in Via ROMA in the heart of PALERMO, and you can reach every place in 5 10 minutes walking. The Breakfast is very good and they always give you every days typical sicilian sweets. Our room was very big and confortable and very clean. It is a perfect small Hotel to visit Palermo and it is not too expensive. We hope to came back. GRAZIE A TUTTO LO STAFF PER LO SPLENDIDO SOGGIORNO. Luisa e Jose Carlos","17836":"Wonderful location in walking distance to the Marina, Teatro Massimo, Capo Market, across from Lido Market. Room had a nice big bed and a balcony, the receptionists were very sweet and helpful, the breakfast was nice with good coffee! We went on the anti-mafia tour which we found profoundly interesting, and on the Streaty food tour which was fun and tasty eating the local street food! The local restaurants were to die for, we didn\u2019t have a bad meal!","17837":"I stayed here for four nights and was not very impressed. I'll start with a few good things though. The staff were very friendly and those that could speak English did their best to be helpful. Check-in was quick and easy. The rooms were a good size and bed was lovely and big as it was two single beds pushed together. The bathroom was clean and the shower was hot and powerful. There was air-conditioning in the room which worked well when needed and was easy to adjust. However, the hotel was very run down and shabby in appearance. It is on the first floor and the lift is tiny. The breakfast was a limited selection of cold meats, cheese, cereal and cake. Nothing hot at all. There was bread for toasting but no standard toaster, just some sort of flat toasted sandwich making machine. The worst bit was my room. It was a corner room with windows over looking a very busy crossroads. Traffic went past constantly day and night, including many ambulances with their sirens on full blast and motorcycles with no silencers. Although my room had outside windows, shutters and inside sliding doors, none of these shut properly so did little to shut out the noise - I may just as well have been trying to sleep on the street.","17839":"We stayed at Catania Centro Rooms for 4 nights in two different rooms. It is placed in an old building in the center of the city, just on the corner with the main street and mere 10 minute walk from the very city center. The rooms are nice and very clean, staff helpful and the breakfast is good. There is very limited parking space, so if you are coming by car, be sure to reserve the parking in advance. Overall, good value for the money.","17842":"Amazing b&b situates perfectly in one of the main road of the city, you can reach the cathedral in literally 15 minutes by walk. Everything was tidy clean and the staff 24 7 was really polite and helpful.","17872":"I stayed for 2.nights. The lication is very convenient, near the city center, close to the train station. The staff is very friendly and helpful. However, the internet connection did not work and the television reception was quite poir.","17901":"Let me start with the good things as these are few: central location, ok breakfast  Bad: 1. toilet makes loud and strange sounds when light on or flushed toilet- even when lights off, stranger sound for 1 more minute- which at night is not at all convenient...  2. Toilet not functional with paper- so imagine all the paper used in a separate basket... I did the mistake to flush paper and it got broken clogged.  3. Really noisy as the rooms face the main road  4. Small room, no option to open windows cause there are a lot of mosquitoes during night (there is a mosquito device in the room but remember there is a lot of noise and you cannot leave it open and sleep) so there is a huge feeling of claustrofobia (red carpets witch makes it worse)  5. rude staff at reception: we could not stay for the whole 3 nights but for 2, we could not get our money back but were promised we can have the city tax included (9 euros) and the beverages that we will consume. in 3 days we had 20 euros value mini bar beverages and when we wanted to do the check out there was a huge fuss on how much we have consumed from the minibar. I insisted to pay in the end as we were put in a really uncomfortable position the staff being really upset and annoyed by the fact that we consumed too much Apparently now they were also adding the city tax to that amount which was so unprofessional. I then insisted we want to keep the room's keys for the 3rd night as it was ours (initially we said we won't stay the 3rd night and were promised the city tax and beverages... now our deal was off) and they got pissed off and were not talking to me anymore in english but with my bf in spanish...rude! In the end I insisted to give me my change as I was paying for all of this and mentioned I really don't want the keys for the 3rd night all I want is to leave the hotel forever and that they can book it for the last night to someone else and double their profit. Then they've decided to give my money back and say in that case they don't want me to pay anymore and said goodbye. THIS WAS EVEN MORE FRUSTRATING!!! 30 minutes at the reception, humiliated in the worse way possible! Never again! At least if it was a nice hotel...but had to bear all of the above in the 2 nights there!","18007":"I have just returned from a five day break in the fascinating city of Palermo. L'Opera Buffa proved to be a very comfortable, home from home, for our stay. The host greeted us by pointing out key sights to see and some really good restaurant recommendations, all highlighted on a map of the city. Park of a Sicilan house, right in the centre of town, it was clean, well equiped with good wifi and the bed was wondefully comfortable. It may be useful to point out there is a USB power point for charging phones so need to buy an adapter for visitors from outside Italy. Just the right side of quirky, including interesting artwork and a colour changing rain shower, it reflected the very individual city it is found in. The hosts and staff were all extremely solicitous and provided a really good, varied breakfast, that set us up for the day ahead. Within one day of staying, we felt really looked after, including having a large jug of delicious strong coffee and fresh toast brought to our table, without having to ask. I can genuinely recommend staying at this lovely B&B.","18018":"We stayed at L'Opera Buffa in June 2018. This B&B is located right in the center of Palermo, 1 minute from the Theater and at walking distance from all major attractions. The owner greeted us when we arrived and took plenty of time to show us where the main attraction where and how to reach them. He also gave us a list of restaurants and bars we could try during our staying with their business cards. Really great.  The rooms are small but clean, functional, and stylish. The breakfast was simple.  I would consider returning.","18020":"A nice-sized, clean room with a view of the Mediterranean and the busy street below our window. The location couldn't be better; you can walk virtually everywhere that is worth visiting. The host was great, very helpful and a nice, interesting all around person who displays an interest in his guest that goes far beyond treating them as customers. On-site parking is a major plus, especially since finding safe, free parking is far from easy. The breakfast is quite good and the host is there to ensure that everything is to your liking. Downsides? Not really; very good value for your money.","18030":"A superb little B&B right in the heart of the city of Palermo, on the edge of the \u201ccentro storico\u201d. We booked here as it is close to the Teatro Massimo where we were going to see an opera and this location is just a two minute walk. Entering the building we were not sure we had chosen well, there was a mountain of plastic waiting to be collected by the council under the new differentiated rubbish collection, Saturday is the only day they collect plastic! The narrow spiral stairs were the second doubt, no lift. However one arrived in the B&B it was everything we expected having seen the website. Welcome very good, clearly they work a lot, nice explanation of things to do and places to eat, time was no trouble. Room very clean and just like the photos on the site, fully equipped with tv, wireless, air conditioning and air fresheners (in the bathroom there was a need for this as there seemed to be a light drain odour, nothing grave and the air freshener covered it well. They even put a thing to take care of mosquitoes. Towels are changed every 3 days or sooner if you specifically ask. Room cleaned everyday. Room very quiet, never heard other guests even though there were always other guests. Staff all very nice and helpful. I would certainly consider returning. I think the right spiral stairs should be in the advertising because for older clients it may be a bit much, and the entrance area could do with a lick of paint, but don\u2019t be put off by the first impression, it\u2019s a great B&B and in a perfect place.","18040":"We arrived at the property at the expected time after having traveled for almost twenty-four hours to find the door locked and no one there. After standing out on the sidewalk for an hour or more and no person from L'Opera Buffa showing up a kindly neighbor took us in his car to find another hotel. We booked with Booking.com and have requested a refund. Neither the property nor Booking.com has offered a refund even of their commission. We are seniors and this was very trying for us. We suggest thinking twice before using those services.","18042":"A very clean room with a good wifi signal. Camilla, the hostess, was great. She is very friendly and helpful and even went so far as to park our car, which is no mean feat on the street the place is locate: narrow and very small parking spaces. I would have wound up going to the parking garage and paid a fortune. The location is great; we were within walking distance of everything we wanted to see. The owners called me 3 times on the day of our arrival to find out when we would be there. Unfortunately, the person on the other end of the phone only spoke Italian. I couldn't figure this out since my country code in for North America, se why bother calling me if you can't speak English.","18125":"In the middle of Sferracavallo where easy to find anything you look for , from good restaurant , beach , supermarket and shopping , they have beautiful rooms and very clean . Very good prices and great restaurants around The staff is very helpful and caring Nothing to complain about","18135":"I had mixed experience with the place. And if I would not change the room my review would be very negative. I arrived two days later than planned and suppose my room was already occupied so they gave me a permanent apartment which I didn\u2019t like at all \u2013 cold, stinky, old, half clean. It looked terrible and I felt very uncomfortable in it. But after two nights I moved to other one where I spent the rest of my vacation in happy relaxing atmosphere \u2013 the same like I was expected \u2013 renovated, clean, everything in good order, comfortable and it was a pity to leave it at the end. Andrea \u2013 the manager, speaks very good English, he is very polite and helpful. Apartments are located in 5 minutes from main square of Catania. A small food shop is just in front, Bakery is on the corner, local Market is in 5 minutes walk. Quite safe surroundings. For sure I will stay there again with pleasure.","18173":"We booked 3 rooms in this charming hotel  b and b. The rooms were stunningly beautiful, and well appointed with en suite bathrooms. Everything worked perfectly: heating and hot water and super comfortable beds with lovely linens. Exvellent buffet breakfast with yummy fresh Italian pastries. Location is just near the Politeamo, so very central. Highly recommend this hotel  b and b.","18180":"We arrived b&b at 8 pm. But over booking. no room...... They had another b&b and transfer my reservation to b&b lanza(not rooms lanza) without any notification. We had to move at night time to b&b lanza for 20 min walking. Evenif they said it takes just 5 min.","18191":"They are situated right on Etnea street, near Piazza Manganelli, so you can't find a better location. Our room was perfect for 2, spacious and more important, quiet. It had everything we needed, confortable bed, hot water. They serve breakfast between 9 and 11, nothing amazing, mostly pastries and fruits. For our stay in Catania, it was the perfect choice and i think it's a great place for couples.","18195":"The B&B is located very centrally in via Etnea and it's relatively cheap. The lady who works there all day and looks after cleaning, check in and breakfast is incredibly kind and does a great job. Kudos to her.  Sadly, the rest is not very good. No noise insulation at all, so you can hear what everybody says. This is particularly bad for the room that faces the main reception area.  Furniture and decor are very cheap. Because of the attempt to make it modern, the property ends up having no character.  Rooms and bathrooms seemed clean (apart from a few hair here and there), but the quality of both bed linen and towels is very poor.  Lastly, there was a persistent smell of smoke across the property, especially on the evening of our arrival. I suspect someone had smoked inside the property.","18197":"This is the worst place I have ever stayed in! Based on the price and the reviews I expected much better!  We had to go through a gate to an inner courtyard (currently a building site) to access the front door. Upstairs to a large open plan room with a reception desk, dining and kitchen area with bedrooms of it. It is a cheaply renovated 400 year old building. The bed was hard and the frame was propped up on bricks. The pillows were also very hard. There was NO sound proofing from the busiest road in Catania. We heard people going past our room, the telephone ringing, the T.V. and the builders by day from the inside of the building and the traffic noise from the outside! Not what you expect for 206 euros for 2 nights! The lady who looked after the place had to communicate with google translate which was awkward. I asked if it was possible to have breakfast at 8 the next morning as we had to be out early for a trip. The reply was the lady worked a long day 8 - 8 so breakfast would be from 8.30. After hardly any sleep due to traffic noise and the very uncomfortable bed, we were disturbed by the lady clattering around making breakfast at 7 for other guests who were equally noisy. So we got up and had breakfast out before our trip. If we had not been out all day we would have searched for somewhere else to stay. The next morning the lady and guests were up chatting and clattering around again before 8! So we packed up and left!","18204":"Do not try to book this Hotel! Last Friday we had a booking of 2 rooms for 3 days at B&B Etnea Palace, whom Marlene Salerno has confirmed by email that we can arrive at the place at 8am. We went to put our luggage around 8.30am but no one opened the door or answered the phone. We had waited until a guest came and let us in and continued to wait inside (at least) as no one was at the reception at 9am. Around 9.15am, a man came at the place and told us he was Marlene's father and that she was coming a bit late since her car was not working and we continued to wait.. At 9.45am this man told us that they had a problem with the bath's water and it is not possible for us to stay there. Please note that this was not true as all rooms were fully booked and it was a total lie. We had to book another hotel on our own on the day which was a total hassle for us and very inconvenient!","18217":"The rooms are super clean and located near the historic district of Catania. Carlo, the host was the kindest person we met during our stay in Sicily. He helped us park our car right in front and made every effort to accommodate us. The only downside to the stay is the bar directly below that pounds out really load disco music all night. We had to take an early flight and so even at 5am the music was still roaring loudly. Thank goodness he supplied us with earplugs!","18218":"Great location. Comfortable room and very clean bathroom. It is overall a good experience until you reach your room and try to sleep. The appartement is located above a night club that opens from 10pm to 4am or even later. I\u2019m very disappointed that Carlo did not warn us upfront or that we did not read it clearly in the reviews.  We now better understand why the price was relatively low considering the location, you simply cannot sleep as you get the impression that you are in the nightclub while in your bed trying to sleep. I don\u2019t recommend this place for people who need rest and calm, that\u2019s clearly not the right place. That is so sad because the apartment is really good.","18254":"Perfect location, comfortable, clean and quiet room. An extra, shared breakfast room with coffee, tea, cereal, jam at guests' disposal. The B & B Oberdan is located in the heart of the city, within walking distance of dining spots and major sights. I highly recommend. A place worth knowing. The owners are nice and helpful","18260":"Just a lovely B&B on the border of the city, the rooms were spacious, ours was on the street side but blacked out completely and was intensely quiet, so we got some great sleep. The staff was friendly, breakfast could have been better but for what we've paid we were happy. Also there's free street parking which came in very handy as we had a rental!","18349":"I wouldn't recommend staying at this hotel more than a couple of days and only if you are on a tight budget. It is dirty and smelly. On one of the days during our stay, the whole room smelled like a sewer. More strangely, there was a hatch in the wall, which was boarded up with thin plywood.  There is dust and dirt everywhere! The bathroom is unclean and one of the (fresh) towels had pubic hair on it... They don't change the towels or refresh the toilet paper and there are NO toiletries. The beds and pillows are uncomfortable and the blankets dirty.  Although the building is old and outdated, I think the biggest problem of this hotel is it's TOTAL lack of cleanliness.  On the plus side, it is very central and the stuff is really helpful and kind.","18356":"The hotel is in Piazza Stesicoro, very central in Catania. When you get there you see a small door, hardly noticeable. Behind it, 2 floors of stairs, which lead you to the reception.  The staff were very, very friendly. Stressing on the very because they go out of their way to be helpful. When we got there, we realised that parking is a nightmare, so we called and asked whether there's anywhere we can leave the car to drop the suitcases. The receptionist immediately told us that she'll come down to help and they came down and took our suitcases.  They also gave us pointers on where to park and directed us towards a paid and guarded carpark in the area.  When we checked in, they gave us room for four, which was actually a flatlet with 2 bedrooms, shower & toilet, kitchenette and dining table. This was also air-conditioned.  The only reason that I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is that the hotel itself requires some TLC. Otherwise everything is perfect (staff, location, amenities, etc...)  --------------  Some additional notes for potential travellers. There is a McDonald's just below the hotel that stays open till midnight.  A restaurant that is very popular is also around 20 metres (1 minute walk) away from the hotel - Trattoria del Cavaliere. It has very good prices and genuine food. Cover charge of \u20ac1 per person.  Round the other corner there is Via Etnea which leads to the Cathedral at one end and to the public garden at the other end.","18374":"The hotel is really nice and well worth the price: big rooms, quiet, clean, excellent breakfast (real coffee, fruit juice, fruits, cheese and ham...) but if you stay several nights, you might be tired of walking there and back to the city center, crossing the same dodgy and filthy areas (it's funny the first time).","18375":"So we booked this place via BA Holidays, and arrived late on a Sunday evening. We were shown to a room right next to the reception area marked with PRIVATE on the door, which had no external view from the window at the back, as it was totally frosted (like bathroom glass, etc). The bathroom was tiny, there was a noisy fridge in the room, and most strangely there was a hatch in the wall, which was boarded up with thin plywood. Reception was just the other side of this, and all night we could hear every tiny squeak, whisper, step, and conversation in the reception area. We asked to be moved for the next night, and we were, to a room at the far end of the hallway (marked simply B while all the other rooms had numbers), right in the corner of the building. It was quite shabby, and while we readied ourselves for that night we decided to call it quits and booked elsewhere for the rest of our holiday, having found a much nicer place online through Trip Advisor.  I wish we'd checked Trip Advisor first before booking this place through BA. We have let them know about our issues here.  It's a place which is fine for a night or two if you're on a tight budget, and just need a bed & basic bathroom, but it's certainly not palacial as the name suggests, and not a place I would recommend. It's more like a glorified hostel.","18398":"we just stayed there the 1 night, after being in a really bad place. Really helpful, excellent service, very helpful staff they go out of their way to assist, speak really good English. Walking distance to a lot of the attractions.","18403":"Now here is a place right in the centre of Catania.... the rooms are old... yes, it has a charm too but.... it just needs an uplift. Bathroom with shower... the shower wall is just cracking and old... air conditioner sometimes stops working if the net is over used... and when you come in there is a pretty steep staircase to climb... I did not book this place myself ... But.... the very positive thing about this hotel is its staff... they are just wonderful!!!","18423":"The whole place needs heavy renovation. The noise is a little loud at night since most rooms can accommodate five or six people and the guests were young. The place calls itself B&B but the second B is missing since we were send to a bar outside to have our breakfast. This is most pathetic since we won't be the real clients of the breakfast place. On top of that there is no dedicated parking near the place.","18437":"A group of 5 friends sharing a big room wasn't that bad. Toilet was good and private as the shower box but this was too small for my size. It's an old building renovated with very good location. My bed had a very soft mattress so I end up having some neck pain. The breakfast is served at the street caf\u00e9 on next door out of the hostel. Agata - owner- was very caring manager. Internet very slow. For short stay is okay. Have fun!","18443":"LOCATED THRU A SMALL DOOR BUZZER next door to MCDONALD'S ON Stesicoro Square .Up 33 stairs and this is really a friendly B&B .Nice help youreself breakfast is a bit repetitive and the lighting could also be better.Perfect location spoilt by general noise outside from early on road cleaning to racing cars bikes and celebrations which we did not mind. Catania is a busy city and not a holiday resort so if top quality is important then try close by .Value for money.Yes.","18506":"I stayed there last night. At first I really liked the place, our room seemed clean and big. First, the hostel is a bit further away from the train station than what it said on the web site. When we got there the owner wasn't there so the housekeeper receive us with very good attitude, definitively the best thing about this hostel. First thing I saw next morning: GIANT cu","18552":"We have been 3 nights in this bnb. Super convenient. Very central. Parking are along the street or in the garden inside (both under payment). The staff is super nice, very helpfull and always smiling. Rooms are spacious, clean and quite. Very well designed. Bathroom is nice and clean. We had a balcony in the room and even if the view was just on the street its still a beautiful view. Had a great stay!!! Definetly recomended!!!","18555":"This B&B actually also has apartments in the same delightful garden courtyard, just off the main road into the old town. We decided to stay in a studio apartment for two which was perfect. Each morning we walked to the nearby bakery for fresh bread and croissants and the well equipped kitchen was more than adequate. The bed was fine and there was a sofa as well as a dining table with chairs. The bathroom was a little tired but for the price, which was good value, we were very happy. The best thing was the parking for our hire car, which was in the private courtyard, with our own electric remote to open the gates, totally private and secure. Usually the parking in quaint Italian old towns is a nightmare so this was perfect. The B&B was also only 200 metres from the main square and within easy walking of all the sights.","18556":"we stayed here 1 night and it was a large apartment in a very nice location. the balconies on the front overlooked the street. we did not find it noisy at all. we walked from here to all the attractions in catania. the staff was very kind and helpful. it was very clean. would recommend staying here.","18557":"We have stayed in this spacious, upstairs apartment twice. It has an excellent location, a long, narrow balcony, and is very quiet. Furnishings are a bit tired, but comfortable. The kitchen is not well equipped with utensils or glasses, but it has enough for basic food preparation. It does have a refrigerator, cooktop, oven and toaster, and a washing machine. The staff is very nice and communication both ahead of time and during our stay was prompt and courteous. We would definitely stay here again.","18559":"We loved this place. A bit odd when you first arrive, especially if you are not familiar with Catania as the entrance is behind a large metal gate.  We were warmly welcomed and shown to a nice and VERY CLEAN room with a nice balcony. I was seriously amazed at how clean it was! Even the bed and bath linens and towels smelled fresh and didn't have that 'hotel smell'.  Reception was very professional and answered all questions and even gave recommendations on places to eat that weren't tourist traps.  I have already recommended this place to a family member who is planning on going to Catania soon.","18561":"My friend had stayed and recommend it. We were not disappointed. It is located just up from the Dumo Square and easy to explore the whole town from there. We picked the mini suite and nice to start off our stay with so much space. Loads of fluffy towels and fridge with water. The beds were firm.  Staff really helpful and showed us all the things to find and about an ice cream festival on over the weekend.  We really enjoyed having this as our base.","18567":"LITERALLY THE WORST EXPERIENCE AT A HOTEL EVER!!!!! Paper thin mattress, not enough towels or toilet paper, thin walls, and NO WATER ON OUR LAST 2 days there!!!! Noooooo water???!!!!! Couldn\u2019t shower , flush the toilet, wash hands , brush teeth, and no compensation from the hotel???? Cheap piece of crap, spend a little more and book at a nice hotel, this is worse than a hostel!!!!! DONT BOOK, you\u2019ll regret it!!!!!!!!","18569":"Lovely place with the most friendly service. Lovely time spent there. The place is spotless, the location perfect and a welcome like rarely received. We had the little apartment upstairs with a beautiful view. Well done and keep the good work. Daniel and Christiane","18572":"very friendly and nice bb hotel in the heart of city. old sicilian building on the main street with a large space where you can park your car. clean and large rooms, enough facilities and very friendly staff. breakfast in your room is good and cheap.","18573":"Perfect place to stay in Catania. Close to the Piazza Duomo, in the heart of Catania. Very special rooms, lot's of space and very friendly staff. There is also the possibility to come with a car. Best value for money you can get.","18574":"The grand picture in their ads is not where you will be staying! These rooms are on an upper floor of what seemed to be an old office building. We arrived after dark were left by their driver on a dark street. He simply pointed in the direction of the entrance and drove off. We would have been stranded if someone coming out had not opened the gate. Then standing in a gigantic dark courtyard, there was no-one to ask for direction except a passerby. We were directed inside and up an ancient elevator but came to a locked door. After much knocking another guest let us in. Eventually staff did show up, was very apologetic and helpful but the initial experience after 12 hours of travel was not a happy one. To say the room was small would be a kindness but we were too tired to care. We did need an extra night\u2019s accommodation and the staff was very kind to find us another place to stay. Everyone who worked there was friendly and helpful but I think there are many other nicer places throughout Catania for a similar rate. It is in a great location, near centro and the fish market.","18575":"We've been travelling in Europe for a month, and this B&B rates highly in comparison. As other reviews mention, location is great. Room smallish, but OK with a kettle and desk. Internet is fast. A room on the street is noisy, but we enjoyed the sound of Sicilian activity, however it never stops at night. Maybe pre-book a room on the courtyard. AC works fine - great breakfast value if you preorder, delivered to your room. Early checkout though - 10:30. A bit complicated to access, but doable.  Great restaurants nearby, and Gelato at the Piazza by the church.","18577":"I stayed here for the night with husband and 2 children so that we could sample Catania before catching an early flight the next day. This place has very many positives; great location near the cathedral, parking on-site, lovely staff and many traditional charming features within the old building block. The suite where we stayed was very spacious and the bathroom looked like it had recently been updated. It was easy to sort a taxi for the next morning via reception and we were also able to print off tickets for our flight. The receptionist was very nice and accommodating. The city of Catania is stooped in history... lots of lovely old buildings showing past grandeur. This place I\u2019m sure will become more and more popular as people discover its charm. The only reason we didn\u2019t give this a 5* was because it was a little dated and it lacked a few extras such as a second pillow, extra blankets. It is also in the heart of Catania which comes with the noise factor, the road outside is busy with cars and people. I can recommend this B&B and would stay there again when returning to Sicily. Thank you Palazzo Bruce for your hospitality :heart:","18587":"We travelled in a group of 4 friends and had two rooms, both of which had a double and a single bed. Both rooms were very spacious and the bathing Room 1 was really big although quite draughty and cold since there was no heating.  Place is extremely central and easy to reach all the interesting spots of Catania. Plenty of good food choices nearby. Initiate opted not to take the breakfast and went out to the cafes on the square, but the last day we asked for breakfast and for \u20ac3.50 we had a really good choice (a la carte) and quite abundant (the cappuccino was too milky though).  Would thoroughly recommend this B&B especially for guests with a car as it was easy to travel outside Catania.","18603":"Booked a room for a one night stay and had a fantastic apartment. The parking in the court yard was very convenient as there wasn\u2019t a single space anywhere on roads when we arrived at 21.30 pm. Eduardo came out to meet us on the road when we arrived and gave us a quick orientation of where we were, - very central, and what to see the next day. Our several balconies overlooked a main road so it was a little noisy the next morning but worth it for the location. Bed was extremely comfortable and I\u2019d certainly stay there again if in the area.","18604":"We booked the apartment on the top floor as we were too late to get a room - so it was very spacious nice room for two & we didn't use the cooking facilities. [There were a few basic ingredients provided.] The people were very nice and we had their breakfast several times which was decent. The only slight drawback was a dog was let out onto an opposite terrace at certain times & one night it barked for a very long time. It didn't stop us sleeping but was tiresome. If you are a particularly light sleeper then bring ear plugs just in case.","18606":"Well, we have booked a triple room with a balcony for almost a 90\u20ac, but what we got was a basement-like apartment in the separate block of the building, with a small window opening directly to the parking lot! After me complaining to the manager about fraudulent photos and misleading room description, I got an angry answer, that it\u2019s the only room they have available and yes, the photos just show some of the rooms, not all of them!  Imagine my surprise, when 10 min later an Italian family of 3 checked in after us! If not for a tired child and very late evening, I would have left that place immediately.  We have been to Italy numerous times, with B&Bs always nice and matching the description on the website, and stuff friendly. That place is a nightmare.","18614":"Spacious clean modern room & bathroom. Near the centre ( Duomo) piazza, short walk to bus stations and near amazing restaurants, cafe and the absolute amazing fish market! Staff very informative and gave amazing tips on where and what to see and eat. Breakfast is at an additional charge and with great cafes around, we don\u2019t recommend it. Room n1 is right by reception which is very noisy to midnight.","18618":"Booked for 4 nights, details specified 2 bed 2 bath extra toilet. Reality 2 bed 1 bath extra toilet in the laundry. Apartment might be ok for a family as it has 2 double beds in 1 room. Bathroom not really clean, mould in shower, fittings loose. Apartment not well set up. No iron as specified (had to ask), 1 wine glass, no laundry supplies, no broom, no coffee, tea,milk etc. Tap on sink very loose. Manager blamed booking.com for the error. We checked out the next day and moved to RG7 apartments, fantastic difference. Manager advised booking.com that we were a no show so we could not write a review! Paid in cash. If you are looking at this check every detail.","18632":"This is a very clean B & B and is probably in the best location in Catania. The B & B is a few minutes walk from the Piazzo Duomo, famous fish market etc and many other attractions around the city.  The staff are extremely helpful and friendly and the rooms are a decent size for a city center hotel. Car park is available for 10 euros a day in the courtyard, which is secured with an electric gate.  Breakfast is served to your room with a variety of pastries and juices. Basically what you get is what you pay for, but it does the job for those interested in a place to sleep and no thrills accommodation.","18648":"This is my 2nd stay here. It has a great location close to the Duomo. Rooms are very clean. It is a little noisy during rush hour as it is on a busy street. Parking is available in the courtyard for \u20ac10 per night which is really useful. Staff are very helpful and friendly and can recommend places to eat.","18650":"I went in this B&B several times and I can say is the best place to stay for a short o long visit in Catania. Is located in the History center of Catania and in only 200 m you can visit the Duomo. The Owners are very polite and available to satisfy every request. If you arrive with the car they have a private parking which you can forget the stress to find a parking in the heart of Catania. The Attention to details is 100%. I really suggest to try if you want visit the beautiful Sicily.","18656":"I must admit, upon arrival, trying to find the B&B along a narrow, busy street, with all buildings that all looked like they needed a facelift, I did not have a good impression. With a rental car, I drove around the block twice, before finding the huge wooden door leading in to the courtyard of the ancient block of buildings. Coming in to the courtyard, my impression very quickly changed... I was under the impression of stepping out of Catania's bustling narrow city centre streets into a calm old Villa: a picturesque rundown fountain, trees and calm and quiet immediately changed the atmosphere and picked up my hopes. And I was not disappointed! I was extremely well and warmly received by the receptionist, who immediately offered something to drink, and then took me and my wife to the reserved room. The old building seemed to vanish, and I was surprised to find a spacious and well equipped ensuite bedroom, very tidily decorated, with a clean and fresh look about everything. Hot water in a spacious modern bathroom, an electric kettle that looked brand new, and a fantastic balcony with a view at the church in the old part of Catania: I could not have asked for more. The receptionist was always extremely friendly, and had the right answers to all our questions. We went on a day-trip to Mount Etna, and she gave us all the right tips, making it a very memorable stay. I would definitely stay at the B&B again, as it is not only well kept, but well located, in the city centre, and also has exceptionally friendly and helpful staff. I loved my stay!","18709":"We spent a week in Hotel Elite, which locates in the center of Palermo. The Hotel has very nice, quiet rooms, with a comfortable bathrooms. The staff was really friendly and helpful. Thank you very much! I would highly reccomend this Hotel.","18719":"Hotel Porto Azzurro is located in Saint Paul. The airport can be reached either by a local bus that takes a distance of approx. 40 minutes or 20-22 euros taxi. The hotel is very close to the bus station. The situation is less populated compared to Sliema or Saint Julien, but it is very picturesque and quiet. It can be reached very easily in the port of Gozo. It is an older hotel as a building. The room was very generous, new furniture and the bathroom also very beautiful. Daily cleaning is done. The hotel has an outdoor swimming pool where you can have lunch or dinner, but also a small indoor pool, games room and gym. The staff is very kind and ready and provides all the necessary tourist information. There is also an on-site tour desk on the island. Nearby there are supply shops, restaurants. There are many local buses that connect with all the resorts and cities of the island, and transport is very well organized. The cleanliness in the hotel is very well maintained. There is also a store on the ground floor of the hotel. For tourists it is necessary to own an electric power adapter or buy it from the existing store in the hotel. Breakfast was disappointing, extremely modest and insufficient giving the feeling of poverty. We have to work on this chapter. Hotel sin. If this impediment were not even recommended without reservation.","18793":"I have visited Catania with my mum in July and I have to say the service in this hotel was one of the best received so far. There was great attention to detail and the room was pristine. It had all the comfort you need and although was very central the location is very quiet. We were very happy. We recommended great local places to eat and places to visit. We would most certainly go back if we travel to Catania again.","18796":"This B&B hotel was much larger than I expected but was in a fantastic location for the Centro Storico. The decor was cool and modern and the rooms and bathrooms were fairly large. But the four of us who stayed there couldn't get past the strong sewage smell (we were on the 4th floor and it was strong throughout the building) and the noisy halls. Granted, there was a high school group staying there, too, so without a large group it might have been different. But we all agreed it brought back memories of our college dormitory stays. The front-desk service was very nice, and they have a few snack and drink items for sale in the lobby. The have breakfast for 7.20 euro on the top floor with an open rooftop lounge area that was lovely.","18805":"Just came back from a 16-day trip to Sicily and we loved every bit of it! Palermo was the last stop of our trip and we spent 4 nights at the Quattro Canti B&B. Location is excellent, just right opposite the Fontana Pretoria (fountain of shame) and few steps away from the beautiful Quattro Canti junction. Teatro Massimo is a convenient 10mins walk away and the airport bus is round the corner in front of Rinascente. We felt very safe in this area and there are many restaurant options within 5 mins walk.  We had a room on the second floor facing the next building hence not much of a view. Room is okay overall and bed is firm and comfy. The restaurant on the top floor has a good view. Special thanks to Bernadetta at the front desk who was extremely helpful with all our needs.","18810":"In front of Piazza Pretoria, less than1 minute to Quattro Canti, you can visit Palermo on foot. Staff very nice and helpful also prior to our stay. Room very spacious (we were 3 adults), clean and well furnished. Also bathroom comfortable. Our room 315 was at 3rd floor with a view on Piazza Pretoria. Breakfast on the roof. Really strongly recommended, also considering daily fare.","18817":"Beautiful hotel; bedrooms are unique, comfortable and clean, staff is amazing and the view on the rooftop is breathtaking. The location is also perfect so you can visit the city by walk. I highly recommand!","18827":"Reserved 4 rooms for party of 8. All delighted with hotel. Staff were helpful, the breakfast was very good and the rooms were comfortable. We considered this to be good vale, however it is the location that is the main asset. You can't INMO get better in Palermo","18829":"The reception staff were great \u2013 so welcoming, friendly, efficient and helpful. The location is exceptional.   Although perhaps a little more basic than we had been expecting, our room was clean, had good air-conditioning, a small fridge, a comfy bed, an excellent TV, a safe and it was amazingly quiet.   However, a little more thought into the details of the room wouldn\u2019t go amiss!   The bedside light switches were so far away that they couldn\u2019t be reached from the bed! The bathroom had no towel rail. The lovely large shower head drooped and sometimes fell down with the pressure of water. The shower cubical leaked however carefully we closed the doors \u2013 I had wondered why there was a drain in the middle of the floor!   The best feature of the hotel is breakfast on the 5th floor and in good weather you can eat outside. The bakery items were all freshly cooked, often warm, and of excellent quality. The granola muesli cereal was far too sweet and there could have been more fresh fruit but all other aspects were lovely.   A small section of the terrace itself was able to be used throughout the day and we sat up there in the sun a couple of times to recover from sightseeing! The rooftop view was delightful.   We had one dinner in the terrace restaurant \u2013 not actually owned by the hotel. It was OK but the meat wasn\u2019t properly trimmed and was full of gristle. There are many other better value eateries nearby.","18838":"The location was the most ideal about this location. It\u2019s central to the strip with restaurants and most sightseeing in Palermo is walkable. The rooms were clean and hotel is modern. Very affordably priced as well. You get a tremendous amount of value for the money.","18849":"The location is ideal, being spot in the middle of Palermo's centro storico. The service at reception is very friendly and helpful. Rooms have all the amenities you expect. The a c works as it should and the free wifi connection is very good. Breakfast is more than decent and the cherry-on-the-cake is the incomparable setting of the 5th floor terrace where it is served. Exceptional views over the Palermo rooftops.","18868":"Our travel advisor recommended this hotel in Catania Sicily. Beautiful, greeted by very friendly staff, professional and helpful. Beautiful ambiance. Hotel is situated on the west coast of Sicily with a beautiful view of the ocean. Rooms are clean, comfortable and large enough for two. Dinners are awesome and breakfast is delicious. Can highly recommend","18870":"The Plaza Hotel is very clean and a pleasant place to stay. We had two different hotel rooms and the sea view room was far better. Slightly larger plus had a balcony where we could enjoy the breeze and view. The food in the restaurant was fine but breakfast was not as good as I was hoping.","18872":"Looked with a nice view over the ocean, but a bit to far for walking distance into central Catania.  Reception where nice and welcoming.  Rooms are a bit small. Had a single room, but still.  Breakfast was good on the fourth floor. You could sit inside or outside.  I parked my car on the backside of the hotel and asked at check in to see if that was ok. They told it was not safe and that I should pay for parking in a garage. That made me feel unsafe in that area. Finding the garage in dark evening was hard. If I had rented a bigger car I would have had it even harder getting the car into a parking spot in the garage.","18874":"Plaza classifies as a 4 star hotel but it hits 5 stars all along the way. Spacious rooms , excellent bathrooms with all amenities. The fourth floor is the dining room and outdoor terrace which provides excellent views across the bay and into Catania town. Breakfasts are very good indeed - with good choices for both continual and cooked items. You can even have a glass of prosecco to help the breakfast along - and the day itself. Th staff here are superb - totally customer friendly and happy to assist with the loveliest of smiles. The one drawback is the location which is not central for Catania old town but its easy to get a taxi, or the hotel shuttle - the matter can be easily pre-booked. Tip - look across the road for a small building called Cuti where you will find a nice cocktail bar plus access to sun loungers and the sea. Discounted prices of E5 for Plaza guests. A truly great hotel","18875":"Nice hotel, close to metro station but a bit outdated in terms of rooms and facilities (eg shower). Room large enough to accommodate a family of four (incl two small children). Good breakfast, although at a certain moments the staff was not sufficient, nor the tables for the number of guests arriving. AC not working in the room during first night but after request support, staff was really helpful and fixed it!","18881":"I am not going to say that it\u2019s entirely their fault, I should have been more alert when booking. But I realised when arrived that not only they have no swimming pool or private beach, but the only \u201csea experience \u201c available is a separate club where you have to pay entrance and it\u2019s in a corner of a rocky sea side where the waves are challenging you to stay alive, or at least this is how it felt in comparison to my idea of a pleasant beach experience. I asked one of the receptionists if there were any sandy beaches, she said that about half an hour from the hotel, 25 euros taxi ride, no shuttle busses and there is no proper public transport to take you there and the hotel isn\u2019t cooperative.  My stunning moment was when I decided to cut my stay short in plaza and booked another hotel for my remaining two days. The day I checked out (2 days prior to my departure, 4 days in total it was). The receptionist checked me out without even bothering asking why was I checking out early. They simply don\u2019t care. And I understand that to some this is just a job, but they reflect the name of the hotel and to me that said enough. Never again!","18888":"Very unconfortable for business meetings. Underground and not enough air. Common spaces in meetings area very small. Ok for seafront rooms. Ok lobby area. Very diffi ult to reach this hotel by public transport.","18902":"Clean but the air into the room was perfumed with a kind of very cheap deodorant that makes the air unbreathaking. We kept the window open all the time without ged rid of this terrible deodorant. Just this would drops their stars from 4 to 2 in my opinion. The personal is very friendly and nice. Bathroom okay. The location is quite far from the downtown of the city and the taxis are incredible expensive there so I don\u2019t recommend this hotel to people who wish to visit Catania","18903":"Conveniently located clean and neat breakfast included very good, parking on site for an additional five euros. Located across a busy highway is the water, a short walk down the set of stairs is a very small but very adequate beach. Breakfast is located on the fourth floor which is the rooftop gives a beautiful panoramic view of the ocean.","18907":"We stayed 2 nights here. The hotel looks lovely from outside. Our room lacked natural light as the shutters over the window wouldn't open (the maid opened them for us the next night). Air conditioning was not great, never cooling the room down too much. Breakfast had coffee in paper cups and juice in plastic glasses, with a limited selection. Staff were friendly. Good location for seafront walks, but a 40 minute walk into town.","18910":"room stinks of heavy vanilla scent asnd i mean heavy. Avoid the restaurant, go out i didn't due to weather. no power adapters and no amenities. even mini bar was severely limited, but the fake vanilla scent just killed it. plus i had to exit on the street, in the rain to get into hotel","18911":"I went to the Plaza Hotel for a very interesting conference in a big room in the basement. I appreciated the location very much both above and below. It was elegant, clean and comfortable. And the location is very close to the sea.","18912":"Check in - they are very friendly, Rooms are ok, if you don't have a room with a view to the sea you have a view to the vulcano. The only thing is, maybe some mattresses are at the end of their life and should changed. Breakfast is typical for this area - tastey. Check out is the same as the Check in - very friendly. On my next trip to Catania I'll stay at this Hotel.","18924":"Situato in un palazzo storico nel centro citt\u00e0 si tratta di un affittacamere appartamento non rinnovato di recente, molto semplice. Il bagno \u00e8 dotato dell'essenziale e gli asciugamani vengono cambiati solo su richiesta e a pagamento. Il personale \u00e8 gentile e disponibile per le eventuali richieste. Costo contenuto ma adatto soprattutto a giovani e a chi si accontenta di un alloggio modesto. Located in a historic building in the city center, this is a not recently renovated, very simple, room apartment. The bathroom is equipped with the essentials and the towels are changed only upon request and with a charge. The staff are polite and helpful for any inquiries. Low price but suitable for young people and those who are confortable with modest accommodation.","18944":"Nice staff , good location in the city center , room are very confortable with new furniture , tv , ac ,hair drier , cosmetics , comfortable bed and brand new bathroom. The staff was very polite and helpful.","18959":"I really enjoyed my stay.The d\u00e9cor is lovely, the room very clean and quiet and the bed beautifully comfortable. I slept very well. Rich and tasty breakfast.We had every day cleaning in the modern decor room.  Staff were really friendly and helpful and the locations is brilliant for getting around Catania and has lovely cafes and restaurants nearby. I would definitely stay again and recommend it to others.","18960":"I visited the B&B stesicoro from 6th-10th October with my wife and daughter for a short family holiday. Where do I start when talking about this establishment, I\u2019ll start from our arrival. We pulled up at the front of the B&B to be told by our driver that the entrance to the B&B was down a small side street. As we walked down we came across a small door, outside there was a couple trying to get into the same place. They said they had been ringing the buzzer for over 5 minutes and no one had let them in, eventually we were buzzed through the first door to then come across our next hurdle which was lifting our case up 3 flights of stairs. Please be aware if you are disabled or not to good on your feet there is no lift to get to the B&B this is not stated anywhere on there website. Also I think this is the reason why they don\u2019t show the entrance on there website. The next obstacle came when we reached the door of the B&B, myself and the couple who we met downstairs then rang the bell and knocked on the door for a good 10 minutes before we were eventually met by a Italian gentleman. He opened the door quite abruptly and began to say something in Italian which non of us understood but from his body language he didn\u2019t seen to happy to see us. Eventually we got into the B&B and it began to come clear that we had interrupted there lunch. We booked in and we were shown to our room which was the Ciane room. First impressions is it seemed ok but we didn\u2019t really stick around to check the room as we wanted to get out and see the city. When we got back that\u2019s when we started to see the issues, for starters we were supposed to have a double bed which as we found out was just to singles pushed together. We noticed issues in the bathroom like seals loose on the shower, the door on the shower was loose from the rail. I will warn anyone taking a shower to be careful as you could have it on cool and suddenly it will go scolding hot. There was also the issue of a nail sticking out the skirting board, parts of the floor coming up. Marks on the floor hidden by a rug. Besides all the that my biggest issue is the noise, please be aware that if you have a reservation ring ahead and make sure you are not in this room. The whole 4 nights I barely slept, for starters the room is bang next to the front door so when people come back in the evening you get woke up by that door slamming and people talking. The door downstairs was always slamming from people coming and going, and the amount of times I was woke in the morning by the staff setting up for breakfast and chatting, the air con unit bang outside the window was so noisy when the rain hit it. In my opinion this bedroom shouldn\u2019t be a room at all. I know the hotel will probably respond like they have to previous complaints about noise which is we should expect it with it been a city, but I\u2019ve stayed in some of the biggest and busiest city\u2019s in the world like New York and London and I\u2019ve never struggled with sleep due to noise. Other issues where at breakfast there our 9 rooms in total but only 3 tables for guests,this is ridiculous as on a couple of occasions people were having to wait. The breakfast is average at best they continue to bring out the same food everyday if it wasn\u2019t touched from the day before. One thing I did learn was they do eggs but I only found this out after reading a previous review which was also slating the breakfast and the B&B responded by saying they offered them. Strangely though we were never offered them once until we asked, we genuinely didn\u2019t think they did any cooked items. The only plus to the B&B is I would give a lot of credit to the young lady that works there, she seems to work really hard not only at breakfast but also looking after the rooms. Overall I wasn\u2019t happy with my stay and I think this is the first time I have reviewed a hotel B&B with such poor marks. The main thing for me was I didn\u2019t sleep well the beds weren\u2019t comfortable the noise was ridiculous and it just wasn\u2019t a good experience for me or my family. We would love to visit Catania again but we would definitely look else where for our accommodation.","18961":"Very large and clean room, cleaned dailly with perfection. The room itself was a little worn out. The breakfast was tastefull but rather small, no eggs or other warm dishes. Staff was very friendly and helpfull.","18963":"By the hotel site i booked a double room with balcony and instead of that i got a room seeing at the behind the square narrow street without any balcony,without any frigo or safe.When i asked to change this room i was told that they were full though i booked for a room with balcony that the description photos were showing that it was facing on the main street and the landmarks...THERE IS NO LIFT and the rooms are at the second floor of an old and tall floors building that in order to go there you have to climb 3 real floors .When checked out i asked to pay in cash and i asked for the receipt.A man pretended not speaking english denied to give me the receipt but told me to give him my mail address in order to send it to me later...I asked a simple document saying i paid my staying and it was rejected...so that i obliged to pay by credit card in order to have a proof that i paid...and no receipt of course during 3 days after my staying ever came in my mail...All this discussion was made by the gentle help of the translator made...Never again to any type of B&B ... Pay also attention at the bathroom floor that is glishing dangerously when it is wet...","18966":"The roof collapsed at 3am when we were on our honey moon, so we were left on the street with another pregnant couple. We wanted to leave immediately, but were refused a refund.  Greedy, egocentric owner. Expect a reply where he denies everything. I wanted you.","18970":"We were very comfortable and happy, and safe, with everything we needed all in one room with great view, clean and modern. Lovely breakfast, space very tight where the breakfast was laid out. Host was very pleasant and helpful, Made me feel welcome.","18974":"On day one, we shopped and dined at the Via Principe Belmonte at Maxs recommendation. Our last full day, Max arranged for a driver to give us a tour of Palermo and Monreale. Our family of four had a very nice time. The trip and the stay in Palermo offered good value. Monreale is beautiful","18975":"Best B&B in Catania close to via etnea and all shops.Staff were very friendly and helpful. Would definitely book this place again and recommend it. Good breakfast was served and rooms were also clean.","18995":"I recomand B&B Stesicore for all the services, for location and for polite staff. I visited Catania, the Etna Volcano, Siracussa, Taormina, and other little city with a rented car. It is a wonderful holiday.","18997":"Fabio and his team make you very welcome, the B&B sits on the main square and only minutes from Duomo square, within easy walking distance of everything in the City. Rooms are clean you have all you would expect from a B&B for a City break. Ear plugs are essential, due to the great location the traffic noise is very high. Recommended for anyone wishing to be right in the Centre. ( Not to be confused with Hotel Stesicoro which we cannot comment on )","19009":"We stayed for a few days in this BB, booked directly with the hotel. From the begining the staff was very friendly and assisting. Daniele, Fabio the manager very nice and on your service any time. The hotel is situated in the city centar where is very easy to reach all the attractions and restaurants. Sometimes you can hear the noise from the main street, but you must consider that you are in city centar. The breakfast it self is vey nice and consistent, coffee also I must say. Overall, I would come back and I hope I will. It's good value for the money if you need short accommodation in Catania. Preporu\u010damo!","19015":"We stayed here for 2 nights. Arriving from the airport with the local bus is fine. There is a bus station really close to the B&B, less than 5 minutes away. The entry is not on the main street, but in the back. No elevator so you have to carry your luggage up the stairs, but the girls from the B&B offered to carry them for us, which we actually didn't accept. Staff is friendly and helpful, especially Aura who went above and beyond to make our breakfast lovely! The room was spacious, with a comfy bed and overall clean, but it was noisy (closing the window did not help) and the floor really needs to be exchanged. I didn't really feel like stepping on it without shoes... The bathroom was overall clean. Really good location, 5 minutes to the city center and there are many restaurants nearby. Overall fine for 1-2 nights.","19020":"The hotel is situated in the middle of Catania, next to Via Etnea. Ideally recommended if you intend to use Catania as your base. There is some noise until late but the bonus is that you are in the centre of the nightlife. Staff was helpful and rooms were clean. The hotel is situated at the second floor and there is no elevator, but staff assisted us with luggage. Highly recommended!","19024":"centrally located on a lively square. Might be a bit noisy if you are not used to sleep in the heart of the city however we enjoyed listening to the music coming from the plaza below. The hosts were great people. They take great care of their clients answering all your queries and giving you useful information on how to go around Sicily. The rooms, linen and towels are impeccably clean and the maid is also a very sweet lady who makes sure you have a good breakfast too. I recommend this B&B to all as long as you don\u2019t mind the stairs to it. Its on the second floor however they offer to help you up or down with the luggage.","19036":"Perfect location; very close to all attractions, markets, restaurants and caf\u00e9s. Room and bath were spacious and airy and we enjoyed access to 3 balconies in our corner suite. Impeccable daily housekeeping. Copious breakfast buffet; coffee prepared to order. Fabio was very helpful with excursion arrangements and resto recommendations. Friendly staff. A-1 service all around!","19040":"We stayed here for 1 night when we first arrived in Sicily. We had requested an airport pick and this was organised for us. We arrived at almost midnight and a guy from the B&B came out into the street to help us with our bags and also carry them up the stairs. The room was clean and comfortable. The only problem we came across was that the shower didn't drain very well but that was a minor issue. We were able to leave our bags here the next day and collect them later in the afternoon. The staff were very friendly and helpful even though some did not speak English and we don't speak Italian. Breakfast was good. This B&B is in a good location and we were able to walk to the train station to catch a bus south.","19045":"We were staying there 4 days. To be honest, it is not 3 stars as it is published. When you arrive, you have to go up 2 floors with your luggage and there is no lift. It is well- located, but that means that you are downtown ( lots of noise till late at night). Breakfast ... forgettable. The bedrooms a bit old and dirty. Concerning bathrooms, their policy is charging the guest who wants towels washed every day. ( First time in my life) The receptionist was nice and helpful, but all in all, it was a disappointment.","19059":"Situated in a very safe, well lit alley on Piazza Stesicoro, round the corner from Via Etnea. The B&B balconies overlook Via Etnea and Piazza Stesicoro. The host and staff are very helpful and courteous. We had a corner room,with three balconies, one of which overlooked Piazza Stesicoro. Its always alive with pedestrians and moving traffic. Close the windows and shutters to block out the traffic noise.The room, sheets and towels are immaculately clean, Breakfast is quite basic, and hot water for tea or coffee is always available in the breakfast room, should you require a cuppa at any given time. The shops, bank, coffee shops, restaurants and market are walking distance from the B&B. The only drawbacks are the stairs, as no lift elevator is available, so I do not recommend for anyone with a slight or severe disability and also the entrance to the shower in our room was somewhat narrow with a slight high step, so getting in and out was slightly awkward. But as the Host said they are working on renovations so hopefully that will be sorted out in the near future. Otherwise we had a very pleasant stay and would recommend it to anyone who wants a basic, clean, modern room in a very central location.","19061":"Fantastic location, right in the centre of the City. Everything is walkable from there. Good sized rooms and bathrooms. Breakfast was also good. Very helpful, friendly staff who really put themselves out to make out stay a good one. Unfortunately is located up 2 flights of stairs (no lift), so a real effort with the travel cases. There is no parking onsite, so do not hire a car. The drivers in this City are mad! We will come here again","19065":"From the airport bus, get off at Stesicoro bus stop, walked for 3 mins then should be there. The main entrance was situated in a back street aisle, not on the main street. A little bit creepy and dark at night. The B&B was on the 2 F, you need to climbed up, if you have luggages, might have problems, no lift! Staff in there only speak Italian, but very very helpful. Since we are two ladies, the staff (not as young)insisted to help us to carry our cases up, very kind of him, even we rejected his offer he insisted. As this is a B&B, rather standard and basic. Clean. Breakfast is okay, no cooked food, with all you need. Location is good, an interesting, colourful and lively daily market just opposite, should visit. Shops, cafes all near to the hotel, very easy to get around. Only if you don't mind the entrance is not very nicely presented, basic facilities, need to climb up and down, then this is okay. A bit noisy at night, as it faces the main street.","19067":"Location is excellent! Staff are friendly, helpful with very good English. Market and shops are just few steps from the B&B. Breakfast delicious. Staff can give you advise about good restaurants and attractions.","19095":"I only stayed in Palermo one night, but the location of the B&B is perfect, very central so you can walk to the main sites rather than having to take the bus and being stuck in traffic. It has fast wifi, comfortable rooms, great breakfast, and the host Germana goes out of her way to make sure your stay is perfect.","19100":"Palermo...a very pleasant and surprising experience! ..and to leave in Dimora CentroWell, close to the cathedral and the most beautiful places in the city it was really an unexpected gift! Thank you, Germana, for accommodate us and for all your hospitality! Cristiana and Ecaterina - Romania","19184":"Great location, most spacious room we had on our trip with huge shower and walk in closet. Everywhere well decorated and spotlessly clean. Only stayed one night but slept well and breakfast was good. Fantastic value.","19205":"The B&B is located in an historic building right next to the Duomo. I had a very large rrom, almost a suite. There cannot be any better location and the place is very quiet. Extremely nice staff . Breakfast is self service with the help of a member of the staff and you take it to your room . Mine had a very nice table and chairs. Very close to the Alibus stop to go to the airport.I'll definitely come back here when I'm in Catania again.","19217":"Great little b&b only 5 rooms so very quite. Breakfast self service which you take to your room. Very clean,and the staff very friendly. Right on the duomo square as you walk out of the door. Did find that some of the restaurants did not allow you to just have a drink.","19230":"The best location to explore the city center. Everything is in walking distance. Clean room, effective air-condition and normal breakfast to be eaten in room. There is some noise from outside until about midnight.","19326":"A pleasant and comfortable hotel ideally situated to explore Catania on foot. The staff are helpful and speak good English. Breakfast is provided in a caf\u00e9 next door and has a good buffet selection of meat, cheese, pastries. fruit and yogurts. The staff are always on hand to help and keep the buffet table well supplied. There was a modern air conditioning unit in our room which was quiet and effective. The hotel shows photos of a small garden and swimming pool but fails to mention that they charge \u20ac15 per day to use it. The room cleaning seems to be a little bit hit and miss and I had to go down to the reception to get extra toilet paper when the one roll provided ran out and again to pick up disposable plastic mugs that were not replaced. Not major problems but attention to details would have made our stay even more enjoyable","19330":"Excellent location, our room was all in all comfortable (very well airconditioned) and although it was situated in very busy Via Etnea, street noise was minimal. Breakfast was sufficient on the 1st of our 2 day stay but scarse on the 2nd (b'fast is served next door to the hotel entrance). A young lady at the breakfast area (forgot her name) was very willing to help you plan your sightseeing around Catania and plan excursions. Bathroom needs being seen to as wash had basin had missing stopcock and the shower area not adequately lit. Towels are visibly old and need to be changed. All in all the hotel is suitable for a 2 night stay.","19337":"The staff here were so welcoming and helpful. I emailed a few days before as I fractured my ankle and they couldn\u2019t have been kinder. The rooms are very large and comfortable. I wasn\u2019t too keen on having breakfast in an adjacent building and I didn\u2019t find the breakfast very good. If I went back to Catania, I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to stay here again. The location was excellent, very central with lots of bars, restaurants and shops close by.","19341":"The hotel is well located. It is some years old and looks accordingly (also the rooms). The employees were very friendly. If you would like the park the car, you should call in advance. Price quality ratio is ok for one night. The breakfast choice is limited and is served in the bar close to the hotel.","19353":"We stayed here over the New Year. The location is excellent, right in the heart of the cultural and historic centre of Palermo. It is an easy, mostly level walk to many of the major attractions. The room was clean and characterful, and spacious. Breakfast was fine for us, it was a generous buffet, continental   Sicilian style. Paolo and his mother were great hosts, allowing us to leave our luggage after checkout as we had a late flight.  We'd happily stay here again when we return to Palermo.","19363":"This would have been possibly a 10, however an incident the very last moment somehow destroyed our whole experience. Having been in the hospitality industry for years, I've always been trying to be lenient with all hotel stuff and fair. Honestly, this is a nice hotel, convenient, clean, nice located and with many amenities, good breakfast, a good value for money generally.HOWEVER, unfortunately, the experience we had in the end was not as good. I stayed there for four nights (13-17 Nov) with my gf. Max, the owner helped us rent the car for 2 days, starting from the second day of our stay. So in the morning after having paid for the car, I went to reserve the parking space in the hotel as I had to and advised to do so. There were 2 girls who after advising where or what to do to park, I gave them 20 euros to reserve the hotel parking for us for 2 days (e.g.10euros per day). Unfortunately, I was so stupid to give cash and to receive nothing as a proof of payment. In any ways, we decided to keep the car for an extra day and by the check out, instead of being asked to pay only for one day of parking plus the city taxes, we were asked to pay everything once again, included the room which was paid through booking plus the parking for three days. This became more frustrating when max called the girls as I asked him to do and the girls denied the payment of the parking. This incident plus that we were asked to pay for the room once again at the very last moment was very suspicious, since we were in a hurry to catch the bus to the airport as we had a flight to catch. I mean it cannot be anything else, but either a fraud or bad management in front desk. After a 30 minute dispute at the front desk, finally we left to the airport were we only had 50 mins to drop off the luggage and to pass the check before our flight departure.","19364":"B&B Vittorio Emanuele is a very cozy and comfortable hotel in the centre of the old city of Palermo. The room was wide enough, the bathroom had a lot of space and it was very clean. The breakfast was served on a marble table with a lot of goodies! The owners of the B&B were too friendly. The hotel is located in the centre of Palermo's old town and you may find by walk all the historic places (e.g. Palace of Normands, Opera, Cathedral etc). The double room price is worth of booking!","19372":"Spacious room with ac and tv ... spacious terrace overlooking a garden which was far from what we expected especially since it was presented at reception desk as a plus for the room thus increasing the price for the room. Shower was leaking and when we informed we were told that being a Saturday someone to.fix it was difficult to find.We arrived on Friday and used it in the evening and it was already like this!!!  Aside from that you need to leave the wayer running for a long time before it's warm. Beds made but not as tidily as expected. In frigobar we found three small bottles of water as a welcome pack. Never replaced during the other three days. Breakfast area is the best part ... very clean and quite a variety and open for around three hours. Lift is efficient. Very well located hotel ... what a shame that it's not maintained and as well kept as it could be.","19381":"My husband and I enjoyed our stay at San Max Hotel in Catania. It is very centrally located, near restaurants, botanical gardens, and public transportation. It was easy to walk to the sights we wanted to see. The room was spacious and clean. The bathroom was clean but had a musty smell that also permeated the towels. The breakfast was good, although you had to go to caf\u00e9 next door.","19384":"Location is on the Main Street that takes you down to the square, restaurants and public transportation areas. The room was spacious, modern and cleaned everyday. Staff were really helpful and allowed us to leave our cases after check out,we had an evening flight.","19394":"Great great staff!! Incredible price for the quality and familiarity of the hotel. A great decoration and very peaceful.  Breakfast maybe needs a bit of improvement. Probably more attentive staff or more people working in the bar next door.","19413":"Abbiamo trovato questo albergo e ci siamo fidati delle recensioni,e posso dire che la reception \u00e8 realmente disponibile24 24 ,stanze semplici e pulite,colazione nella struttura a fianco dell' albergo e cosa non meno importante ma fondamentale sono 2 ,essere a 2 passi dal centro e la struttura ha il posto macchina,\u00e8 a parte nel prezzo,ma c'\u00e8,la domanda fondamentale \u00e8 riprenoteresti l\u00ec se tornassi a Catania???risponderei s\u00ec  We found this hotel and we trusted the reviews, and I can say that the reception is really available24   24, simple and clean rooms, breakfast in the construction next to the hotel and not less important but fundamental are 2 :being 2 steps from center and the structure has the parking space, is part of the price, but there is, the basic question is rebooking there if I returned to Catania ??? I would answer yes","19420":"This simple B&B is the perfect place if you want to experience old town Palermo on a budget. It had everything we needed, a beautiful roof terrace, large beds, modest breakfast included and very friendly staff. We could not have asked for more. Thanks for a great stay!","19424":"This hotel is conveniently located a short walk from all the main attractions. The owner Max was very helpful after a mix up with our booking and was very patient. He speaks excellent English and was able to answer all our questions and ensure we were happy and comfortable. Parking is secure at the back of the hotel and the restaurant next door where breakfast is served also serves a fulfilling and inexpensive lunch. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Catania.","19425":"The apartment was absolutely perfect everything was new and just renovated. The location was amazing, right in the center of the city, but at the same time the alley was quiet and the noises didn't bother sleeping. The staff were very helpful and polite. Especially Paolo who welcomed us, offered us coffee with sweets and showed the best places to visit from the map. We now have wonderful memories and experiences from this journey.","19432":"Rarely do you enjoy a place so much from the moment you step in. When I first got out from the bus on Via Etnea and dragged my trolley after me I had no idea that on a few meters I will be welcomed in one of the friendliest places I ever been to. The San Max Hotel sits on via Etnea 229 and is easily reachable by bus straight from Catania airport. It is not a new building, which I must say from the start, but rather an old, elegant structure that now houses this place. After checking in, I moved the bags to the first floor, where the room was situated, and was lucky enough to get a room facing a inner court back street so my stay at this place was very, very quiet and peaceful. As usual I will use bullet points with my review so here it goes: \u2022 Location- Great location. Not only is the place so easy to reach from the airport but Via Etnea is the main street of Catania. A beautiful street, on both sides full with old houses and little stores shops that lead to the Duomo. That\u2019s right, the hotel is 1.3 kilometers away from the Duomo and Piazza del Duomo. As a bonus right here you will see the Fontana Dell\u2019 Elefante which you will surely enjoy. Also close to the hotel is the Giardino Bellini and Piazza Stesicoro so you can rest assured you are close to the action.  \u2022 Staff- Nothing but good words. I enjoyed my time spent at the hotel, they were very helpful with information and very polite and it was my pleasure at the end of the stay to leave a nice message in the hotel\u2019s guest book.  \u2022 Room- Now, I don\u2019t know if I was lucky but my room was big. Really big. And the bathroom was just as big. Very clean, daily service, from what I remember they kept leaving us 2 bottles of water each day, free of charge and I really think that was a nice gesture. The room had a small terrace where I enjoyed a glass of wine in the evenings or just stood there contemplating how quiet that part was in contrast to the crowds that filled Via Etnea  \u2022 Breakfast- Italian. Yes, I love this country, yes I love the people here but the breakfast\u2026not so much. As usual, the selection was very limited to some cheeses, one or two types of salami and something sweet. While I don\u2019t usually eat breakfast and don\u2019t care much for it, many of the people I been with on my trips consider this an important aspect so that\u2019s why I\u2019m pointing to it.  For me this hotel was a great place. My whole trip to Sicily was amazing and after days filled with walking in sunshine for kilometers I was glad I had a good room to return to. Each night after travelling to Taormina, Palermo, Siracusa, Ragusa, etc I took my time and walked on the streets, watching people enjoy a cup of ice-cream, a canolli or an arancini. While walking on Via Etnea I found beautiful Palazzo\u2019s, ancient ruins, a Duomo that after all these years I consider to be one of the most beautiful churches I have ever seen, and a great place for arancini and a wonderful restaurant, both which I will review in later articles. While the hotel is fairly close to Catania Central Station I would strongly advise that for your trips exploring this amazing island you use the buses and not the train. For all my travels in Sicily I took buses from Bus Station Autolinee Giamporcaro which is situated on Via D'Amico, 205, 95129. In my opinion the buses are faster which is really important if you plan a day trip in Palermo for example where you have to cover about 210-220 kilometers each way in a single day. As a conclusion if you ever in doubt about accommodation in Catania give this place a try. I enjoyed my time here and maybe you will also.","19463":"We stayed for 4 nights at this property. The property is centrally located, we walked everywhere. We had 3 people in the one room with a double bed and pull out couch. The room is large and spacious. Bathroom is a good size but the shower could use some updating. Breakfast was included in the price we paid and was enough for us- fruit, yoghurt, pastries, salami and cheese. The staff also make you coffee at breakfast which was very good. All the staff are very friendly and helpful. If you also email the property direct and book with them they will give you a better price than what is advertised online. We enjoyed our stay and would be back again.","19471":"Thank you for excellent service, helping us to solve everything from late arrival to recommending places for dinner.  Location is the strongest part of the proposal. We loved the area, especially at Saturday night. You are at walking distance to everything interesting downtown.  Rooms are well designed and well kept, we loved the ambience.  As we are from another part of Europe with different habits, I can imagine to have different options for breakfast. Like eggs and fresh vegetables. But I know, that this is not a standard in Italy, so don't take it as a complain.  Summary - great value for money, we recommend this highly for families and easy travelers.  Thank you, guys!!!","19472":"Bed, book and breakfast are a great place to stay for a visit to Catania it's situated in the center of the city and very close to many of the attractions. There are plenty of good restaurants in walking distance. The room we stayed in Bronte was spacious and very nice, the bed was big and very comfortable . The breakfast was amazing with a lot of homemade food very tasteful. The whole place was stylish and modern. If we are so lucky to come back to Catania we will definitely stay here again. Our host's Diego and Guisi was very gracious and helpfull, thank you for a great stay.","19476":"We stayed here for one night back in October 2018 on our last night in Sicily and we wished we could have stayed for longer!  It was in a great location with only a short walk to the main piazza of Catania. The B&B itself was beautifully decorated with so much attention to detail. We stayed in the Bronte room.  The hosts were lovely and prepared a wonderful breakfast for us in the morning.  We would definitely stay here again if we ever come back to Catania!","19487":"This is seriously the most charming bed and breakfast I\u2019ve ever stayed in. The hosts, Diego and Juisa, make you feel very comfortable and reach out to you before your arrival to answer any questions. I was welcomed here by Diego reserving a parking spot for me right out front. The location is central and all the major sites are a short walk away. There is also a lot of nightlife and restaurants close by as well. My room was huge! The space is tastefully decorated in the theme of a local author. They decorated the space with such attention to detail. You really feel the love.  The best part is the breakfast. I was served a spread of homemade cookies, cake, muffins, budino, jams, and local cheese. Everything was fantastic!  The only thing to consider before staying is that it is located on the second floor without an elevator. This did not present an issue for me, but it\u2019s something to keep in mind if you are a heavy packer.  I would stay here again in a heartbeat!","19543":"We were left outside waiting for almost an Hour at 1:30AM on a Saturday-Sunday .. We kept ringing the Door Bell, Calling the telephone, writing emails and messages on Booking and no one answering. Most of our stuff was kept inside the room. It was cold, we were really exhausted and worrying that we had no place to sleep. At 2:22AM finally they picked up the phone. No proper form of apology was ever given.  Additional Note: Breakfast was very poor. The bathroom was very small and not enough room to have a proper shower.","19549":"This hotel represented good value for Catania for the period I booked when hotel rooms in Catania were in short supply.  Photos on TA accurately represent the actual rooms and public areas, but in reality they are not as bright and well lit as appears here  You have to contact reception to gain access to the property, and on arrival, whilst there is no lift available for Etnea316 guests, help was freely offered with carrying suitcases up the stairs.  Marco wasn't seen during our visit, but Domenico was friendly and helpful.  There was no hard sell of excursions, though they were mentioned.  Breakfast wasn't great , but was acceptable, various items having run out, by the time we visited, but the coffee was fine. There is no bar or restaurant, but this is not an issue.  Etnea316 scores really well on its location.  It's easy to reach by the ALIBUS from the airport with the stop being just a few steps away.  The Villa Bellini Gardens are just across the road  The attractions of central Catania are close by, so just a few minutes walk to many restaurants and bars (Via Santa Filomena is worth checking out). A few minutes more walking will take you past many shops and onto the Piazza del Duomo. No need for a car if staying at Etnea316.  Our room was large with high ceilings, and effective, although a bit noisy, air conditioning. Facing Via Etnea, outside noise was not an issue if windows, and shutters were closed, and curtains pulled.  The room was clean, as was the bathroom. Decoration was fine, though pictures on the walls are somewhat uninspiring.  Unfortunately the bed was uncomfortable, and the hotel should consider replacing mattresses.  Overall, Hotel Etnea 316 was a perfectly adequate place to be based for a few nights in Catania and well priced. It is simple with limited services, somewhat dated, but clean and in a very good location. I would consider staying again if ever in Catania.","19560":"I stayed at this hotel in August and was quite disappointed with my stay. The hotel pictures are misleading, as the place is dark and small, because they keep the very large drapes drawn all day allowing no natural light in. They did this presumably to keep the heat out, because they do not have air conditioning on in the main area (even though it's advertised as fully air conditioned hotel). The hotel is in a good location, and you need to be buzzed in to access, so it feels safe. The three men at reception were all friendly and tried to be helpful (to me at least). Overall very underwhelmed by my entire experience, especially because it was not a cheap hotel. Here is everything that was disappointing: *Hotel took over a week to answer my email about a possible early check-in, after many follow-up emails (which they said no to eventually). They also offered tours to me in their email, but when I asked for more information I didn't get much back. *They failed to tell me that they is a price maximum for the cost of a taxi from the airport to city center, so my cost was insanely high. They also did not tell me about the shuttle bus I could have taken from the airport for 3 euros, that stops a block from the hotel. *The continental breakfast was fine, but the coffee was not good at all. Tasted burnt everyday. *The AC in the room takes a while to cool the room down, but does work, however they will go in your room and turn it off when you leave. I left it on one night when I left for dinner so the room would not get hot again, and found it off when I returned. *The TV did not work, which I did not discover until my last night when I tried to turn it on because the Wifi was not working. When I did that I also saw what looked like a small camera on the tv which completely freaked me out. *The room does not have adequate lighting, especially because I could not open my curtains to get natural light. The curtains cover french doors, that open to the hallway, so that would be a bit awkward. *The bed was incredibly uncomfortable I am used to firmer beds from previous travel in Italy, but this was on another level. I had to take the sheets off and put the winter blanket under the sheets because the bed springs were bruising my sides. The pillows were also very very firm and gave me a stiff neck. *The shower leaked terribly no matter how I positioned the shower head and always smelled strongly of bleach (at least you know it's clean).","19562":"Hotel Etnea 316 is a great place to stay in Catania, located centrally to all of the best attractions, the rooms are very comfortable and the staff is excellent and very helpful and friendly! Marco took us on a day trip to Mt Etna which was fabulous and so informative and it was truly amazing to behold the majesty of Mt Etna, and to hike it\u2019s massive button like cones from prior eruptions. Marco\u2019s continuous commentary was so amazing in its detail and knowledge, truly a trip I will remember forever!","19568":"Via Etnea is the main street in Catania, with plenty of shops, cafes and restaurants and buses to get around. We cannot speak too highly of the input and assistance of both Marco and Domenico whose local knowledge was invaluable.The room was comfortable with welcome air -conditioning. The tours organised by Marco Parentignoti were first class and cater for up to 8 people .If you are interested in the history of Sicily,in all its aspects and life there, this is the man for you.It is clear that he knows Catania and Sicily intimately and imparts his knowledge enthusiastically and with humour .Excellent company. We have been to Sicily before but this time visited parts we had not been to previously.Were we to return to Catania we would hope to stay at the hotel. Remarkable attention to detail ,noted my Birthday from registering my passport!","19570":"My wife and I stayed at Hotel Etnea 316 for 5 nights in September 19.  The hotel is situated on Via Etnea, the main road running through Catania. It is located opposite Villa Bellini Park and is ideally placed for visiting all of the attractions and restaurants   bars that Catania has to offer.  The building is approximately 200 years old and has bags of charm and character that you would expect of a building of this age. Our room had a very tall ceiling and an en suite bathroom which, whilst small, ticked all of the boxes and added to the overall charm of the room. Although the outside daytime temperatures approached 30 deg Celsius the room had excellent air con. Whilst being situated on a main road, any traffic noise did not prevent a very good night's sleep.  This was our first visit to Catania. The help and advice from the hotel staff was second to none, whether this was travel information on the local bus services to get us to nearby towns and attractions or advice on the best restaurants in the area, Marco and Domenico were always ready to help.  You can also take excursions directly from the hotel. We took a trip to Mount Etna with a couple of other guests which was organised by the hotel. Marco was our guide for the day. We were taken in a minibus ( 5 guests + Marco ), initially on a tour through Catania before travelling up Mount Etna to see the lava flows. Marco's knowledge and humour made for one of the best excursions myself and my wife have been on. We will remember the trip and the sites at the top of the mountain for many a year.  At some point we will like to return to Catania as there is still plenty that we have to see. The Catania locals are lovely people who will always look to help you. When we return we will definitely look to stay at The Hotel Etnea again.","19574":"Our first time in Sicily.  We found Marco to be truly fantastic. Helpful and friendly. Told us about all the good places to eat places to visit.  The apartment was clean and modern. No complaints.  The apartment is in the main city, but walking to the old town is no problem.  Would come again","19580":"I stayed at the hotel for a weekend in mid August, only to discover a hidden gem in the center of Catania, Marco and all of his staff are incredible people always willing to help you in whichever way possible they can, they have a personalized treatment for each guest! The location of the hotel is one of the best in town and the rooms have nothing to ask from big chain hotels, the rooms are always clean, with AC and very comfortable If I return to Catania next year i\u2019d definitely pay a visit to Etnea 316. Thanks for everything and for making my trip a wonderful one!","19583":"Our suite was clean, bed was comfortable and sleep was excellent. we had room with balcony (we had 2 balconies) Service was just perfect, every morning we had water and juice bottles in fridge and bread with jam. and we had coffee machine. Location is really near to old town. The host was young and lovely guy who gave us all the information about the city and even more. Thank you so so much. We will definitely come back again.","19592":"Perfect choice to visit Catania e Il Etna. Located in the main road to reach every destination of the center and other parts of the city and to start an Etna tour. The charming team help you and try to solve any request. Even to reach the 2. Floor with your laggues. You can choose different rooms inside the historic building with high ceiling. You should aspects of an Italian breakfast and being out direct to Catanian live. vc","19600":"We had a great weekend in Catania at the Etnea 316. LIke most of Sicily, the building was old and full of character with a very lived-in feel. Not fancy by any standards but had everything you need and was great value for the low price we paid. Very friendly and helpful staff who run their own tours if you want to get out of the city. Didn't take the breakfast as there are a myriad of great options as you'd expect from Sicily, including the very touristy but very decent Savia just downstairs. Perfect hotel if you'll be spending most of your time exploring Catania as we did.","19610":"[--], the owner of the hotel only cares about money. We did not book any of the tours he organizes so he got frustrated and decided to make our stay a bit more difficult. The breakfast is VERY poor in terms of quality and quantity. When one of us took a second piece of bread he asked us to put it back (only one piece of bread per person - his own words). We found one of the rooms unlocked one day. The rooms are far from clean. I have traveled a lot but this is definitely the worst hotel experience I\u2019ve ever had. I DO NOT recommend booking Hotel Etnea 316.","19618":"Be aware! Hotel used my card details unauthorised! I had to start a dispute with MasterCard to get my money back. This took almost 3 months. Moreover, hotel cancelled our reservation during our stay. I didn\u2019t expect that this would be a problem, but it was. When I called Booking.com asking for help to get my money back, they didn\u2019t believed me at first that I was there because of this. This is not whole story, but most important details. Be aware of this!  I hope this review will protect someone else. Please read other reviews. This is not the first time this happened in this hotel.","19626":"Our trip to Katania was perfect, one of the reasons was our stay at this hotel. Sunny and clean rooms, a central location but the most important was Marco and Mimo. Fantastic, helpful and willing to provide any help. With the help of Marco, who is an official tour guide, we managed to make a tour in Etna and we passed it perfectly.Thanks a lot good friends and see you soon again","19628":"The staff is the real star. The hotel is located in the center of Catania, full of restaurants, pubs and wine bar; taxi park nearby, shuttle bus Alibus in 2 minutes. The staff is ready to give the best advices for events, bus timetables and Informations about concerts and night life. Good breakfasts with a lot of local products. We will come back for sure. Tours, excursions and transfers on request at the reception (good prices).","19644":"We stayed at the hotel for three nights. It has a brilliant location within easy walking distant to the centre of the city although the hotel is quite hard to find. The staff were excellent - very friendly and attentive. The room was spacious and warm, with a good ensuite shower and decent bed. The ambience is quite and relaxing. Breakfast was pretty good for an Italian hotel with a supply of fruit and rolls and some cereals. The staff arranged an excursion for us both to Mount Etna and Taormina - the guide, Marco was very passionate and knowledgeable going to extra limits to make it enjoyable and amusing. Worth taking them up on the offer of a tour. I would definitely return.","19660":"This is a hard review to write as this was a fabulous place to stay for so many reasons. Sabina was gracious and hospitable hostess and the lady who helped with the breakfast was helpful and polite. The rooms were beautifully decorated and kitchen crockery was so chic. We had bedroom number 1. And there was no worry about anything there. We had a great stay. However, our friends in rooms 2 & 3 were facing the main road where the Univery students gather at night. Especially noisy are Saturday nights, where the noise from the street could be heard until 4:30am and that\u2019s with double glazing and ear plugs. Then the street cleaners and rubbish collectors come through at about 6am every morning. Sabina, the owner, is petitioning the council, with the rest of the residents and business owners, to get a curfew set. Let\u2019s hope they succeed. The other two problems were that I\u2019m not good with narrow, open air balconies and that\u2019s what lead to rooms 2 & 3. Hence, this is why I had room 1. Be aware that that\u2019s the only way to access these rooms. There also isn\u2019t a lift, but there aren\u2019t too many stairs to get to the guest house and they are wide and easy to ascend and descend. The last problem, was that, just when I thought that we were over having to throw toilet paper into waste bins, rather than flush (must be a definite problem around the whole of Sicily) we had to do it here at the guest house. That\u2019s not optimal either. If you can get over these problems, I would definitely recommend staying here. I very much hope, for Sabina\u2019s and the residents of the street, that the Mayor sees sense and places a night time curfew on the noise in the street as that would help 100%. Good luck with that Sabina.","19690":"The place is wonderful. It's situated at the historic center of the city and it is close to all the main attractions in minutes by foot! It is very clean and well decorated. The owners are just cute and they adore pets! Only one note though : when we say free parking, it means by the street and not some private parking...","19701":"We spent four nights at La Cot, during the Christmas period and we couldn\u2019t have been happier with the choice. The location is super convenient, right by the castle and a few mins walk from the markets and key areas of Catania.  We loved the decor and the vibe of the B&B, the rooms are spacious, comfortable and originally decorated, with interesting pieces.  The breakfast is fantastic, freshly squeezed orange juice and plenty of choice every day, including Sicilian delicacies.  But probably the best of all are the hosts. Ninni was in charge when we were there and made our stay really pleasant. He gave us excellent tips for places to go and restaurants around town, he also found for us the best place ever for Christmas dinner!  We certainly recommend and will love to stay there next time we are back in Catania!","19703":"Lovely hotel on 7th floor in central location. Helpful staff and nice light breakfast with great coffee. Good room with large balcony. Good size bathroom and comfortable bed. Good for a couple of nights stay.","19715":"This hotel is a short walk outside the main stretch of Palermo. It's a little bit hidden and we had some trouble finding it. Google maps and some reading of the various signs was essential.  The hotel is very small, taking up one floor of a tallish building. This means there is little street sound, which is nice. However, due to the small number of rooms, you're likely to be placed near the lobby, which is sometimes a little loud.  The hotel has a bio theme, so there's lots of plants and some interesting handmade art on the walls. Our room had some art made out of orange peels, which was weird but nice.  Breakfast was pretty good, although somewhat limited. The staff were very helpful and friendly.  There is one warning to note: the elevator is very old, and very small. If you are at uncomfortable in confined spaces, you will not like this elevator. It is also impressively slow. It feels like the elevator could only be this slow by design. That's how slow it is. We usually walked the 8 floors of stairs going down, because it was quicker.  Aside from the elevator, this is a convenient and cheap place to stay. Recommended.","19723":"Don\u2018t book it - it\u2018s a trap! I decided to book directly and not on a booking-platform so that the hotel doesn\u2019t have to pay any fees and for me as customer it normally has more advantages too. Therefor I booked via phone. I got the same price as on a booking-site but wasn\u2019t told that this is not refundable. I didn\u2019t even get a confirmation or terms of conditions via e-mail.  We had to make a change in our route and couldn\u2019t go to Palermo. 1 month (!!) before arrival I tried to cancel our reservation - I wrote a lot of e-mails and called the hotel several times without any outcome. They didn\u2019t WANT to help me! It\u2019s so disgusting and ridiculous.  I\u2019m really wondering where is my advantage of booking directly. They just want your money...","19728":"Loved this little hotel in Palermo. Good location- quiet rooms on the 7th floor of a building. The staff was incredibly helpful and very bilingual. The room is small but very clean and new. It was a short walk from where the airport bus drops you off so it is very convenient. I even wrote the hotel on which drop off place and they were very helpful.","19730":"We stayed at the Bio two nights in May 2018. The hotel occupies the 7th floor of a building which houses serval other hotels. The awning at the street entrance simply announces Hotels. Our room was next to the reception area, and practically every sound made at the reception area was easily heard in our room. The breakfast was very good even though it did not have a wide variety of items. The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful. It is conveniently located near several sites of interest, shopping areas and several restaurants.","19732":"We stayed here for two nights. The staff were nice and the central location was great for exploring Palermo as well as for going to the airport (the airport bus goes from Piazza Ruggero Settimo). However, it was very noisy. Our room (number 6) was next to the breakfast room and the kitchen, so it was noisy from about 6am when staff started to prepare breakfast. Also, we could hear the lift. For this reason, we would not choose this hotel again.","19744":"This is a lovely little hotel, clean bright and modern. It is on the seventh floor but look out for a big blue canopy saying HOTELS and you can't miss it. The lift is small but in 5 days we never had to wait more than a minute or two. The rooms are not huge but are perfectly reasonable for a city hotel and are fresh and clean with ample storage space. We were in room 4 which is next to reception and. has a terrace which greatly extends the space and even gives a glimpse of the mountains. The shower is possibly the best we have had in 30 years travel in Italy. We didn't notice undue noise from the lift or door keys. There is some traffic noise but you don't go to Palermo and expect silence! Breakfast was nicely set out with fresh coffee and it was pleasant to sit out on the terrace. It would be nice if they also used this space as a evening lounge. It was mostly the same staff all the time and they were always friendly and helpful. The hotel is in a great location. Walking distance to all the main attractions and round the corner from the terminus of the hop off hop on bus. Tip - get 9.40 bus and for an extra 5 euros it does the first half of the tour and then goes direct to Monreale. You can the get later bus back and continue the rest of the tour. Between the bus stop and the hotel there is Via Principe di Belmont which is packed with cafes and restaurants and a pleasant place to sit and watch the world go by. If you don't need the lounges and restaurants of bigger hotels the Bio Hotel is ideal for a short stay in Palermo.","19746":"Stayed for a couple of nights over a weekend in Palermo. The hotel is really central, we could walk to the shops, restaurants, multiple sights and the port. Our rooms were clean, but not very large - this is definitely an urban hotel. The room had a small balcony, which was lovely, given this is a top (7th) floor hotel (in a block containing different hotels or accommodation on each of the 7 floors, though this looked like the pick of the bunch). Breakfast was included and a typical continental mix of pastries, cereal, bread, fruit, meat and cheese. Service was friendly and helpful, including booking local restaurants for us. There is no on site parking but they have a (paid) valet service to take your car and bring it back to you.","19852":"This small B&B has a very good location but that is the only positive I can come up with . It was very difficult to get into even though they were expecting us . There is a phone number outside but I was later told that it is NOT their phone number ! Met by rude man who was reluctant to even let us enter the building . Our room was Ok ( good size and good towels ) but was in the breakfast area so had to ask diners to move to get in out of the room ! Our sink was blocked - beds so narrow we nearly ended up on the floor and you need to be 7ft tall to reach the wardrobe rail . The breakfast was awful . very little fresh produce - disappointing in the country which prides itself on fresh food ! A very limited selection which included 'plastic' cheese in a packet . Would never stay here again although would be happy to find somewhere else better in the same area .","19857":"We enjoyed our 3 night stay at B&B Vivaldi. The location is fantastic, we loved being on the main street of the Historical centre of Palermo. The room was clean, comfortable bed and the air conditioning was great. Ricardo was so welcoming on our arrival and explained places to see and had restaurant recommendations which was very helpful. For the price, which included breakfast, we think it's a great little place.","19879":"My sister and I really enjoyed our stay. The host was warm and helpful, the room good sized and comfortable. Lots of beautiful details to the decor. The neighborhood had perhaps declined lately but we encountered no problems. It is very close to the Borgo Metro station which was great as we are traveling without a car. Highly recommended, would absolutely stay there again.","19886":"This boutique hotel at via Etnea 66 is a real delight. The staff are helpful and attentive, while the metro stop (Borgo) is right next door. Our large Belle-Epoque style room was double aspect with tall French windows and a high frescoed ceiling. The bathroom was equally splendid. The place is full of old-world charm and character. Breakfast is taken in the small basement dining room bar. Alessandra kindly organised our taxi on our arrival in Sicily, despite the fact that we were not staying at the hotel for another 10 days. So helpful. Highly recommended.","19888":"We stayed 2 nights at this Boutique Hotel. Originally built as a home by Antonio's great grandfather for his daughter (Antonio is one of the hosts), it's conversion to a hotel is relatively recent. The real gem and driving force behind this hotel is Alessandra (the other host and hands on Hotel Manager). She is absolutely passionate about her job and will do everything she can to make your stay perfect. Full of energy and enthusiasm, if she's not at the front desk you'll probably find her helping out preparing and cleaning the rooms for her guests. This hotel has an old world charm, and is absolutely beautiful with large rooms, many with frescoed ceilings, original tile floors, and a wide staircase with an ornate banister (there is no lift). How unfortunate that they don't make houses like this anymore! The small garden at the back of the hotel is also wonderful with lots of plants, where you can sit outside and have breakfast. Our suite (room n\u2022 11), on the top floor, consisted of 2 adjoining rooms with a bathroom (make sure to check out the frescoes and original tiled floor in the room at the front). The rooms were very large and spotlessly clean, with extremely comfortable beds, antique furniture and air conditioning. Our bathroom was small unfortunately and definitely needs renovating, but I felt this was relatively unimportant considering the overall quality of the rest of the hotel. Parking was easy and very cheap as the hotel has an agreement with a 24 hour controlled parking lot just around the corner. The location is perfect. The hotel is in Via Etnea (right beside the metro stop Borgo) and in less than 15 minutes walking, you arrive at Villa Bellini and in just over 20 minutes, Piazza del Duomo. It's an easy walk as it's all downhill and whilst admiring the city's architecture you can also shop (Via Etnea is one of the city's main thoroughfares and the high street shopping areas). We will definitely stay at this hotel again when we return to Catania.","19894":"I've arrived here with the ship I'm working on. Decided to stay couple of days in Catania. Just checked in in this lovely little hotel, and can already make an review about it.  It's a little cosy hotel with a lovely women at the reception. She showed me the room, which is nice and clean. Very high ceiling this gives the room, which isn't that big, a bigger dimension. Can't tell how the breakfast will be in the morning, but I expect it's as delicious as any other Italian food places!","19914":"Our experience at La Vecchia could not have been better. The hosts were very helpful and accommodating to all of our needs. All of staff were extremely nice and helpful, and all spoke English well. Breakfast was great and Fernando made a great cappuccino. The courtyard was a great place to have a drink late in the day. TheB&B is right next to a train station, and while we did not use the trains, it would be very useful to those that want to go downtown. The location is not in the thick of things, so if you want to spend your time downtown, you will need to use either the trains or a taxi. Great B&B. Highly recommend!","19930":"Catania is a busy place and Boutique Hotel La Vecchia Palma sits on the fringes of the craziness. It's close enough to jump in the fray and get in a few punches before jumping out and pretending you're innocent. We stayed here for three nights and found the place cozy, warm and just a nice place to stay. We rented a car from the airport when we arrived and found the weekend off-street parking convenient and best of all...FREE! But if you are going to stay during the week, you're going to need to pay for parking. There is a big lot a block over that charges 9 euros a day.  We opted not to take advantage of the breakfast option. Across the street is a great coffee house and in fact, we ran into the front desk manager there! We were offered a great cup of coffee our first morning so the hospitality here is second to none.  This property abuts a metro station and the narrow-gage Ferrovia Circumetnea Railroad station to Randazzo. This was a huge bonus for us and a day-trip we thoroughly enjoyed.  Great property and very comfortable. Be advised that this is akin to a bed and breakfast so you will hear people in the hallway. Light sleepers may not find this a good choice.","19960":"Absolutely amazing location, atmospehere, design and service. I reviewed so many variants, but this one is my love. Great old building, no lift, but what can you expect from the old house. We had a small kitchen, clean beautiful room and bathroom.","20019":"Good location & a very new, clean but functional, accommodation; roomy but dull & grey. Nothing special & the terrace is ok. The last place we stayed at, nearby was spectacular & similarly priced. Young carefree owner. He recommended a rooftop restaurant which had good views but rubbish service food.","20023":"This was such a lovely property in a very local neighbourhood. The owner, Giuseppe and staff were pleasant and helpful when we needed it during our stay. The room and bed were very comfortable and clean. There's little to no noise coming in from the street, making a restful sleep in this busy city is possible! Also the terrace is lovely for breakfast, or private apperitivo.","20046":"The best possible mixture of professional approach, stylish furniture surrounding you, cosy feeling of being welcome and home, flexibility in facing your needs. Salvatore is the Sicilian owner and gentleman of the B&B. From the very first moment he acted as a discreet but present point of reference for all our needs. The perfect combination that one would expect when choosing this kind of B&B. Delicius breakfast sweets-based made it difficult to test the typical Palermos breakfast (croissant+ice-cream), nevertheless, Salvatore gave us plenty of excellent references in Palermo where to taste the world-wide famous street food, as well as small nice restaurants for the evenings. If we return to Palermo, La Cubbaita is our choice.","20080":"We arrived there by our rented camper looking for a safe place to spend the night. Just 10 minutes earlier the gates had closed. Yet an English speaking man came to let us in. In the parking lot! We couldn't enter the camping or make use of any facilities. But we were just happy to be safe. The next morning we went to collect our passports and express our appreciation for the help only to find that we were actually charged for a whole day's fee for a camper and 2 people. That equaled something like 27\u20ac.night before. The man who had to tell us that was someone else. A very polite and gentle man. Also a foreigner but not the German(?) of the night before. He did apologise for this development and tried his best to explain his difficult position. We thank him.  But Camping Jonio gave a black start to our very few days stay on the island.","20167":"the sicilian camping places are in general not of the best quality but jonio is just the pits. the pitches are not maintained and full of the leftovers of previous occupants. bathroom facilities are better avoided (excrements on the floor). the showers are really hot so much so that you get burned. the so called beach is a joke; you have to be an athlet to enter the water but if you manage it you will see some peculiar matters floting around. if you want to have an exciting dinner at the restaurant the waiter (rosario) will entertain you with his agressiveness and arrogance. we tried the restaurant and were the only customer besides the owner. rosario was very attentative with the owner and when we asked if we should come back later as he was apparently overworked by attending the owner, we were told in a very aggressive tone that he is serving the boss and if we have a problem with that. my wife got actually scared by this attitude and we decided to leave the camping facility the next morning. our only advise is: avoid this place besides it was the most expensive camping place during our travel in sicily.","20179":"+ the hotel is small and quiet + located near the train station and the old center (about 10 minutes walk) + English is spoken,very friendly and helpful staff + very clean & quiet room + large double bed with very comfortable mattress + very large bathroom, hot water all the time + towels changed daily + very important in Palermo :a lot of parking spaces on the street around the hotel ( also there is a private parking at 100 meters from the hotel,8 euros day)  - decent breakfast, but it can be improved","20192":"This hotel is more like a B&B, and it is located in a rather poor residential area. The staff were friendly and try to please. Our room was quiet although the air conditioning was somewhat noisy and directed right at the bed head. Surprisingly, considering the number of English speaking guests, there is no English language channel available on the TV. The furnishings are definitely funky, with odd shaped tables and geometric patterns throughout the hotel. The shower was excellent. Towels were changed daily. Breakfast would have been greatly improved with the addition of boiled eggs.","20230":"This is one of the best places I stayed in. Sleep was very comfortable, Breakfast was very good with a freshly squeezed fruits made for us. Overall Biagio, the owner, provided the awesome service and the most friendly welcome I have seen from any B&B. I highly recommend B&B Il Caravaggio. It is like living in a museum itself and having the best service from a curator. You will not be disappointed for sure. It is a difficult time now with Coronavirus going everywhere. Biagio was very helpful to us and understanding person, and his service to customers is absolutely outstanding.","20249":"Lovely hotel, but make sure you book a sea view room. When we first checked in we were given a very small, uninspiring room at the back of the hotel, opened the curtains and there was a wall about ten foot away. Changed rooms (cost us \u00a3200 extra for the week) but view was lovely and room much bigger. Only ate breakfast at the hotel and there was a great choice of cooked food, fresh breads, pastries, cheese, cold meats, pastries, cakes, cereals, yogurts, fresh fruit, hot drinks, fruit juices and even prosecco. All self service and the waitresses cleared the tables quickly and efficiently. Hotel pool not suitable for children, no shallow end. Towels provided. Hotel in great location right next to bus station (hold your nose and ignore the over powering stench of wee as you walk past) - only 5 mins walk (steep hill) to cable car station and another 5 mins (up the steep hill) to the town for shops, restaurants, bars, cafes, ice cream parlours etc. Lots of choice and all price ranges. BUT far too many people to enjoy your evening stroll. Think Oxford Street at Christmas. Only 15 mins walk to teatro (Roman theatre) but again but up steep hill.","20257":"Just stayed there 3 nights in May 2018. Took 40 minutes to check in. No line but just slow service. Room was ok but no way to adjust temperature. Executive room had a view of concrete stairs. Staff was civil but nowhere near polite. They acted bothered all the time. No stamps, no mailbox, no ATM or way to get cash. Location is in the HOOD, I wanted to leave but this was our last and worst stop of a 2 1 2 week trip. They tried to tell me it's a 4 star place, but barely 1. No business room or computer for customers to use. They can't do anything about the location but they CAN improve their customer service.","20258":"We booked a triple room with a balcony, because it was the last available. The main attractions of this room were the balcony and the high ratings because the room seemed small and chip from the pictures. When we get there, on the Reception it was a woman who took us to our room. We had a big and unpleasant surprise when we realized that the balcony is missing. Because she didn't speak English she called the manager. However, instead of recognizing his mistake he tried to convince us that our booking was made wrong because we didn't specify for the balcony in our reservation. We showed the amenities of the room on the hotel site and on the rental site where the balcony was specified in the room description. He was very rude, he said he don't care because he didn't make his own site!!!!! and he called to the site from where we booked and told them in Italian we are making him problems. It was a surreal situation because he didn't want to admit that he make a big mistake, actually he lied about his property. When he realized that we are not backing down he said he doesn't want, and I quote: unhappy clients and he just cancelled our booking by his own decision, he practically kick us from his amazing place. The only good part is that he didn't charge us for the first night.","20271":"The 5 stars are for how welcoming this b&b was. The host is charming and helpful and although this is not a fancy place, I felt very comfortable here. Single room but double bed with water and coffee restocked every day. Very thoughtful. Breakfast is intimate with all guests sitting together and Giuseppe presiding. Important to me since I was solo. Only sorry that I couldn't say goodbye as I left very early.","20274":"This B&B is amazing! It is an old Palazzo and you\u2018ll feel like \u201eKing and Queen of Catania\u201c! Everything was super-comfortable, our lovely host prepared a wonderful Sicilian breakfast and helped us wherever he could. Besides - it\u2018s just a short walk from the station! For those who are searching for an authentic stay with a bit of history and charm - go for it!","20299":"Easy access to airport bus (arrival and departure) one block away lift access to hotel floor. Stayed 7 nights and enjoyed the room, the owner, and the generous breakfast served in the breakfast room by the helpful and charming owner. Great price and we could not have asked for more","20326":"This is not a Hotel with European standards and a False Description everywhere. we booked two rooms for 70 Euros each night, and one of the rooms was a Tiny room on top of a kitchen and you need to climb a spiral staircase from the kitchen, boiling hot although they have air condition. The block of building is very old and scary without elevator and no Lights. They party till 1 am in the morning on the roof and they don't let residence sleep during the night, and to add an insult the door rooms are half glass and wood. No security during the night, no Reception during night time and one night not even lights on in the hall way. The suppose shuttle that takes you to the beach which is advertised is not true, also breakfast not even continental and is not good for diabetic people as there is no choose apart from dry breads with jam or chocolate, a croissant and horrible cappuccino. Other wise the rooms are clean and the people are not bad and try to help you, but greedy for money.","20359":"We stayed at this B&B for one night and ended up leaving the next day because it was such a great disappointment. The public spaces are horrible - the apartment is full of stuff piled on stuff and even more stuff. No elevator in this old building with high stairs. The staff doesn't speak english. We met one lady and she couldn't say even one word in english.  When we arrived to hotel early in the morning the lady working there gave a telephone to my husband. It was the owner calling who was mad because he claimed there was a driver waiting for us at the airport. This was very strange because we didn't book any transport service. We had never even been in contact with this hotel, not via telephone or email or anything so it really was unexpected and very, very rude!!! We didn't even notify them about the time of our arrival!  We booked a double room with private bathroom and breakfast. When we arrived we were showed our tiny room (with one double bed and one single bed - even though there were just two of us. the third bed really took up lots of space in the room!!) and the bathroom - across the hall, behind the staircase. I told the lady that we booked a room with a private bathroom and after some sign language (she really didnt understand a word of english) she gave us another room with a bathroom. The room was super tiny, built above the kitched and with a very low ceiling. You could hear absolutely every single noise from the kitchen. The same evening I called the owner and told him that we are extremely unsatisfied and the room is really definitely not what we had booked. He told us he understands and he'll give us a new room in the morning.  The next morning we packed our stuff and took the bags to the hall where the lady was. She looked extremely surprised and didn't know why we moved our stuff. The owner wasn't planning to move us to another room, after all! So we call the owner again and after a quite intense conversation we finally came to the hotel. Basically he said that there are private bathrooms for every rooms - they're just not in the room. I called the booking site which I used to make the reservation and discussed the problem with them. They also agreed and that that a private bathroom has to be IN the room, not outside the room. After some more very intense conversation we decided to leave and find another hotel. A bathroom outside the room, across the hall, behind the stairs) is really not for us (too hostel like).  When leaving we heard other guests complaining about the same thing.  There are no private bathrooms in rooms. They are ALL outside the rooms somewhere further away.  We didn't have breakfast because it was horrible. Single packed dry breads with marmalade and that's about it.  This B&B is seriously over priced. It should be more like 20\u20ac per night because it's really more like a hostel. Also, there's no staff or anything. I can't believe they have three stars!","20369":"The hotel was ideal for a quick overnight stopover and I would happily have stayed longer. As its name suggests, it\u2019s centrally situated, close to Teatro Massimo Bellini, and within easy walking distance from the train and bus stations, as well as many of the main sights. I could not have been made more welcome and my room, 401, was most comfortable. A most reasonable breakfast was included. Overall very good value.","20374":"We stayed here for one night to be in closer proximity to Catania Airport. We had an approximate 10 min walk from the bus station to the hotel. On arrival staff were really helpful and welcoming and gave us lots of information about the local sights and where to eat. The room was lovely and had everything we needed. Breakfast was really good with lots of choice. We were able to leave our luggage at the hotel after checking out so we explore Catania for a few hours before heading to the airport. The airport shuttle bus had a stop about 2 min walk from the hotel so very convenient.","20384":"We stayed here for one night in September 2019. We were made very welcome and offered a tea tray in our room which was a lovely touch. We were given a map and had the local attractions pointed out to us. This was a short stop over before moving on to Syracuse and then Taormina and it didn\u2019t disappoint - there are some good finds to be had within a short walk of the hotel. The airport bus drops off within a five minute walk and the station for moving on the next day was about a 10 minute walk. The room was comfortable and breakfast the next morning was very good. I recommend this hotel if you have a similar itinerary as it worked very well indeed.","20386":"The hotel is centrally located and it is easy to walk to the most attractions. The staff were very welcoming and helpful. The room was clean and the breakfast was delicious. their homemade pistachio cake was good. The staff was also very helpful in giving recommendations on what to visit and the restaurants. we were happy with the stay in this hotel.","20387":"This small hotel in Catania was an absolute pleasure to stay in. Paula, the owner, is so welcoming, as are all of the staff, and together they have built a warm, family type atmosphere. They are always eager to help or to just have a chat, and are super helpful in advising on good places to eat and drink or visit. The hotel itself has recently been refurbished, and is spotlessly clean and beautifully decorated. It is located within a few minutes walk of the Duomo and main shopping street Via Etnea, and is also a short walk to the train and bus station. The airport shuttle bus stops very close by at Piazza Cutelli. Rated as a 3 Star hotel, this property more than lives up to that standard and is super value for money. Breakfast is simple and plentiful and our bedroom was spacious and comfortable. Any visitor to Catania needs to be aware that it is a busy city with all of the problems that go with places like this, so there are signs of a struggling economy intermixed with the historical buildings and bars and restaurants close to the hotel, but do not let this deter you from visiting this fascinating city or this lovely hotel, instead go and savour this unique Sicilian experience. We are already planning our return to Hotel Centrum.","20388":"We were 9 family members of all ages who stayed 5 nights at this hotel during New Year's. We cannot say enough about how lovely this hotel is starting with decor, room size, its breakfast , its location and last but not least its employees. Marcia, Marina and Vincenzo were absolutely so professional, helpful and caring. They went out of their way to make sure that we were enjoying ourselves and that everything went according to plan. Kudos to all ! Keep up the excellent work !","20389":"I arrived at the Centrum in the middle of a rainstorm. It was about a ten minute walk from the train station, and even with an umbrella I was very wet. But the staff welcomed me, immediately made me feel at home, and took the time to talk about all the great places in Catania that I should visit. They also made excellent restaurant suggestions, humored me when I tried to speak Italian, and helped me book a very early taxi to the airport on the day I left. The room was a typical Italian room, on the smaller side, but clean and quiet. The hotel itself is within walking distance of pretty much anything you'd want to do in Catania. Highly recommend it!","20390":"The amenities are clean with generous breakfast offered plus the friendly reception. It is walking distance to everything you need in a walking tour around the city.  Most holidays the streets are closed so the pleasure of walking and discovering is a must.  Grazia the receptionist makes you feel welcomed and bid you good bye with sentiments.","20394":"This is a nice hotel in Central Catania. We joined a group of friends that were staying here for our last night on Sicily before returning to Rome. The hotel is clean. It is 10 minutes from the airport and many restaurants are within walking distance. The feeling you get is the hotel is locally owned(I do not know that for a fact) and very homey!","20396":"Great hotel. They arranged airport pickup which was priceless after a long flight. Helpful, friendly staff especially Marina who helped us navigate getting long distance bus tickets. Clean quiet room. Elevator. Breakfast was exceptional. Meats, cheeses, local specialties, beautiful baked goods, cappuccino made to order. Something for everyone. Great location. Easy walking distance to all. Great restaurants close by.","20400":"We were so glad to choose the Hotel principe di Lampedusa for our Palermo stay. The hotel is well located, being just a few minute walk from all the action. We were glad to have the quiet without any inconvenience. The staff was friendly, efficient and accommodating. Even before our arrival, through email, they quickly showed their willingness to go the extra mile.","20402":"The staff of the hotel is friendly. Location is pretty good - 10-15 min. walking to majority of attractions.  Nothing in this hotel works properly. You can see it already with constant issues with front doors that have to be unlocked by receptionist. Still they do not operate properly and each guest has a problem. First night when leaving hotel, we've asked for water glasses and toilet paper (they don't leave additional in the room). We were back 5 hours later and it was not delivered. We had also issues with our room doors and during the night toilet flush broke and was making a continuous noise. Our room was changed. In the new room water drain both in sink and shower were not working properly and it was not fixed by our departure 2 days later. In both rooms doors are not tight, so you can hear everything from the corridor and wind literally whistles under the doors. On top we had a lot of dust in our room (photo). Breakfast is also quite poor, as products are not refilled on time, so majority of items are simply missing. They are also not fresh, e.g. the cake and quiche that were served first day, were also served day after (half of it) and still day later (few pieces on a smaller plate). Reporting all that to reception we didn't receive any discount or even small bottle of wine as apologies.","20403":"The weekend we stayed there was an arts festival on the street outside and a religious festival with a parade and band . This made the room we had which was on the front of the square with a balcony even more of an asset. It was a deluxe room very spacious with two large windows and a roomy bathroom. Our friends had a basic room which had no natural light and was inside the building so best to get on the outside facing rooms. Staff very helpful and friendly and speak good English. Atmosphere is relaxed. Breakfast is good with fresh local produce and excellent freshly made coffee. Breakfast staff especially friendly and efficient.Small bar for early evening aperitifs however there\u2019s a cafe bar opposite which is a good meeting point too. Highly recommend this hotel would stay again. It\u2019s location is good for walking in different directions to areas of interest.","20406":"Paola and the hotel staff were very helpful and kind during our stay. She assisted us with our Mt Etna hike providing several options and making the final reservations. The hotel is located near the bus and train stations and central Catania. Many good restaurants are nearby. The rooms are adequate and not large. Breakfast is very good with an excellent assortment of items. We'll stay again when in Catania.","20408":"We stayed here at the end of a ten day holiday in Sicily. It gave us a very enjoyable end to our holiday with a comfortable room and lovely staff. We enjoyed a delicious spread at breakfast. Paola was on the front desk for much of our stay and was very helpful - a natural!","20416":"I highly recommend the Hotel Centrum in Catania - look no further! It's a beautifully and recently refurbished small hotel in a great location just a 10 minute walk from the central station, and 10 minutes in the other direction to the elegant town centre. You can pick up the Alibus shuttle to the airport just down the road a couple of minutes away. My air conditioned room was quiet, and they have thought of everything to make the room comfortable, plus excellent Wi-Fi of course. Breakfast is out of this world, with hot and cold dishes and the most amazing selection of pastries. What makes the hotel is the staff - so very nice, helpful and there for you round the clock. Top notch!","20418":"We loved this hotel. Beautifully decorated, spacious, great amenities, beds were comfortable and the staff helpful and nice. Breakfast was wonderful. The only problem was there was a party going on down the block that was extremely noise till 3 am. We put some music on in the room and fell asleep.","20419":"My family and I stayed at Hotel Centrum in the family suite which was perfect. The room was separated by an upstairs area with a large double bed, bathroom and a lovely patio while on the lower level was a converted double sofa bed and another bathroom. The location is great - 5-10 minute walk to the cathedral and lots of things to do nearby. The staff were so welcoming and were amazing with the children. They made it a wonderful stay.","20427":"This is a lovely, very new boutique style hotel in the centre of the historic district of Palermo. Our room was extremely comfortable and clean, minimalist styling and bright white walls and a really good size. My only complaint was that it was quite dark - the rooms on the inside of the building face an internal courtyard area and it means there is little natural light coming in. In hindsight I'd book a room that looked outwards. They do have parking, but we dumped our car before we got there. Staff were attentive and friendly and the breakfast, whilst not having the same variety as others we stayed at, was tasty and mostly homemade, There was a lovely selection of stuffed croissants and other pastries as well as the usual hams, cheeses and boiled eggs. The location is great as its a stone's throw from all the sights and restaurants and bars. Would definitely recommend.","20429":"I turned up at this place with no reservation after my reserved accommodation \u2018closed down\u2019 without advising me. I could not have been more impressed with Hotel Centrum. The lady at reception (Paola) was so welcoming and helpful. The room was very comfortable and tastefully designed. The breakfast was excellent. I should add that the receptionist showed genuine interest in the guest and in how she could help with regards to sights or eating options. She is a truly charming person who would grace any five star hotel; although perhaps that is just it. The Hotel Centrum is a small, cozy hotel and that is why the personal touch works so well. Who needs a big 5 star hotel?","20430":"The people are extremely friendly and helpful. The hotel is brand new, very clear and well insolated from the outside. The price is very reasonable given the quality of the room. There is a parking facility nearby which is extremely important - do not forget the traffic jam in this city. extremely difficult to find a safe parking place","20431":"It's never the building, furnishings or location that make a hotel special - all of which are top-notch at the Centrum - it's the staff. Nothing was too much trouble for them: restaurant tips, events taking place, bus timetables and lots of general advice. The breakfasts too were amazing. We would stay again","20433":"Great location only 10 minutes walk from the main square. Lots of restaurants and bars nearby. The hotel is fantastic and has recently been refurbished. The rooms have air con, mini bar, free toiletries and small safe. We stayed in a first floor room at the front of the hotel but there was no noise at night. The choice at breakfast was excellent. The best part about this small, family run hotel are the staff who are friendly and helpful. Would definitely stay here again.","20434":"A typical boutique hotel with minimalist design, extremely comfortable and clean -- and most of all, in an unbelievable location. This seems like a really cool neighbourhood, a stone's throw away from excellent restaurants and lively bars. We caught live jazz at a bar in a neighbouring square one night. The service is also wonderful; we needed to make a small change to our car rental and the woman at the front desk called the local office for me, explained the situation and got it done far faster than I would have been able to. She was so friendly and helpful. We had an early morning departure and they arranged our taxi for us and settled our check-out the night before so we had nothing to worry about while trying to get to the airport. Just super thoughtful. I came in shortly after the cleaning staff one day and it was clear that the floor had been not just swept, but mopped -- that attention to cleanliness is fabulous. The staff make a big difference and deserve a lot of credit.  The drawbacks are only very minor ones: the toiletries are a bit basic (shampoo but no conditioner -- not a major problem at all, but for a light packer who relies on what's provided that would have been appreciated.) And while the square is pretty quiet, you're in a lively neighbourhood so you may get some noise as we did. That's just being in a big city though, so it's not under the hotel's control. If you're a light sleeper you may want to ask if they have a room not facing the square (as ours did) and on a higher floor. I would recommend this place to a friend.","20435":"All the staff were so helpful and welcoming. They knew a lot about the local area as well as surrounding towns. They helped us a lot with planning trips in the area and where to eat locally.  The hotel itself was very clean and modern looking, considering it was converted from a villa to a hotel.  For the price you pay, it is definitely a bargain and I highly recommend.  They also help organise airport transportation and book excursions on your behalf. They do go above and beyond.","20440":"Stayed for two nights in Hotel Centrum and it was everything that the other reviewers have said and then some. Perfectly located next to the central core and within walking distance to the WW2 Museum (a must!), amazing restaurant a few steps away and impossible to imagine anywhere more welcoming. Family owned with true Sicilian hospitality. Well priced, beautifully appointed and spotlessly clean. Definitely a wonderful addition to our Sicilian adventure. Wouldn't have missed Catania, and so happy to have met Paula(the owner) and share her story. Don't miss this one!","20446":"We arrived late at night after a difficult car journey and the welcome could not have been better. We really felt valued as guests and both room and breakfast were top rate. Our stay was so good that we booked in a week later for another night. I hope that we can visit again.","20448":"A short walk from the airport to city bus, Centrum has been a great place to stay. We were welcomed with an upgrade to a two bedroom, two bathroom suite, and given helpful information and local places to eat and where to go. Our onward travel questions were researched and answered. Location near the Bellini theatre as well as Main Street If Via Etna makes it an excellent choice.","20458":"Stayed at the hotel for a couple of nights. It is a straightforward, uncomplicated, well run hotel in an excellent location. The staff were friendly and efficient and cooperated with us to handle a late departure time. Breakfast was excellent. The Centrum sets the high mark for mid priced hotels anywhere.","20461":"Wish I could give it 6 stars. This place is great. Close to everything but on a quiet piazza. Super friendly staff that speak good English. Nice rooms, free WiFi. Free breakfast is excellent and plentiful. Would not hesitate to stay here again","20464":"We stayed here after reading reviews about how good it was, they were right it is a great little hotel. It only has about 20 rooms over 4 floors and it is so quiet. The staff were fantastic very informative and friendly and were very happy to recommend restaurants in the area. The breakfast was great, they even cook omelettes to order. First class!!","20465":"We had a very nice two nights, our first nights in Sicily. The breakfast was quite nice: fruit, breads, cheese, meats, and omelets, plus nice espresso and cappuccino.  When we left for the train station, a staff member helped drag my wife's bag all the way there.","20466":"The best place to stay in Catania is here! We had a great time eating freshly made pastries every morning and learning about Sicily from our host, Paula. This is a mother and son owned (16) room hotel. Personal, helpful service for the entire staff in English was the best part. January, 2017 it was completely renovated and immaculately decorated with comfort and taste. It is light and cheerful yet sophisticated. Located an easy walking distance to all the important sites and restaurants, we loved our talks with Paula as we learned of how to negotiate the town and life in Sicily. We loved this place!!","20468":"We got an upgrade for a suit. For free. With an Etna view!!! Old small elavator which gives special atmosphere. Wonderfull old building with an italian climate. Great service for a reasonable price. Don't hesitate to book it.","20469":"Very smart hotel. Excellent service and very friendly, helpful staff. Will definitely stay here again. Also a great location. Whole hotel immaculate, modern and clean. Breakfasts were very good. Nothing too much trouble and plenty of recommendations of what to do and where to go","20477":"Stayed in this lovely hotel enroute to Modica. A perfect hotel in every way-huge double bed with crispy white sheets, spotlessly clean, welcoming staff and a short walk to all main sites. Highly recommend!","20479":"This hotel just changed its name after its very recent renovation. Conveniently located in Catania center, the single room was not spacious but at the right size for one person. The room was cleaned. The frontdesk staff was friendly and helpful to orient the customer in the city (restaurants, place to visit, ...). The Wifi was nicely working in the bedroom. We really appreciated the breaskfast: tasty with a variety local products, very good! Really a good place to stay!","20481":"Wow. This hotel was extremely comfortable and very well decorated. The staff were the most helpful that we have ever dealt with. The breakfast was incredible. Centrally located in the old town but easy to reach excursion points and train station. Excellent","20486":"This hotel has excellent location, is easy to walk around and see the city center. The staff was always friendly and happy to assist. The room was clean and comfortable. The breakfast was nice and the staff in there was very nice as well.","20498":"This family-run hotel is located about half way between the train bus stations and main downtown tourist attractions (about 5-10 minute level walk). Rooms seem to be quiet, compact, and clean. My second floor backside room was particularly quiet. All staff I encountered were friendly and particularly helpful. Breakfast was great and included fresh omelet and freshly brewed coffee, fresh breads, fresh squeezed orange juice, and home-made jam. I counted eleven home-made Italian desserts and cookies as well! I would expect this to be a great hotel for tourist, other visitors, and business people.","20519":"My partner and I spent the first two nights of our 10 day trip around Sicilia in this hotel and we were so very pleased with it that we came back for two more nights before flying back home. Antonio and Emanuela were lovely and very accommodating. The hotel is located in a great area, it is very clean and tidy and breakfast was also really good. You can tell the owners are very dedicated to it. Would certainly come back!","20531":"Hotel located right in the centre of Catania, near the pedestrian and shopping area. The staff is very friendly and professional. The rooms are charming but would some little retouch in the maintenance. The breakfast is rich and of high quality.","20535":"the location of the hotel is excellent walking distance to the main attractions of catania very clean and modern hotel very well renovated tea and coffee in the lobby are offered for free staff is very freindly and helpful (our flight back home was cancelled they helped us to make a new online flight reservation) breakfast is very good we really enjoyed our stay and will choose IL Principe hotel if back in catania","20537":"Great location, just a block from Plaza Duomo and 2 blocks from the fish market.  Plus: nice, clean hotel. Poor internet (1-3 MBPS download speed - worked 95% off the time. I put this in the nice, knowing that other hotels in the area have worse). Front desk speaks english well. Great hospitality. Decent breakfast spread. Rooftop lounge (just chairs, tables, bathrooms, and a shower on the roof) where the view is amazing.  Negatives: No coffee in the rooms. No roomservice. No washcloths (I understand though that this is an American thing). No irons or ironing board. They cleaned throughly but they used a very strong perfume cleaning agent (if you have allergies this will wreck you). The good news is they have large windows where you can air the room out after a cleaning.  If I visit again, I will definitely stay here.","20541":"This is a nice hotel, I have stayed here a hand full of times over a 6 year period. The front desk help is great and all the staff is kind and eager to assist in any way. This place is close to the duomo (elephant square) and all the cafes and restaurants.","20564":"We stayed here on the first night of a small group tour. Our room (406) was a good size and had a huge balcony (part of the fire escape). It was at the back of the hotel so was very quiet and suited us fine. It was a very short walk to the cathedral square which was just as well as it was pouring with rain that evening. Everything was clean and the receptionist very helpful providing us with a small map and a couple of restaurant suggestions which were excellent. The hotel entrance is at the bottom of some steep steps which have good atmosphere. Breakfast was fine, especially if you prefer continental style as there was a good selection of pastries, cakes, etc.","20567":"Il Principe hotel is centrally located to enjoy the relatively few sights that Catania has to offer (the cathedral is, however, beautiful). The hotel is, rightly, 4 star, and has the rooms and amenities that one would expect of that category of hotel.  Unfortunately, when we arrived on a hot afternoon, some hours ahead of another 25 travellers in our group, we found that our well appointed room lacked functioning air conditioning. Presuming that it was a fault in our understanding of how to work the a c in the room, we asked the reception to help us and were told that their 'team' was onto the problem. An hour or two later, still no a c, and so we enquired again, to be told that the reception team would find out exactly what was happening and would call us back in the room. An hour later, when no call had been received, I went back down to the reception to find that the reception team had changed and that the new team knew nothing of our problem. At that stage, I asked to see the manager.  The manger came out from a corner of the bar where he was tapping away on his laptop, and announced in his best 'Dirretore' voice I am the hotel manger, what can I do for you? I explained the problem and in a wonderfully roundabout way he said that, yes, he was aware of the problem and that for some days there had been no a c in our part of the hotel and that they had been unable to procure the necessary part to effect the repair. I expressed my concern at the unacceptable situation (we would have to sleep on a hot night with our windows open and with the noise from the street below) and pointed out that a further 25 people of our group were about to arrive and presumably would have the same problem. With a 'so sorry' shrug he said that this was the case but there was nothing that he could do about it... (I must point out that a fan had been put into the room but that it was fighting a real battle with the heat and humidity). I asked to change room to one which had a c (another group had been checked into another part the hotel earlier and I heard the group leader say You're lucky as the a c is working in this part). I was then told that there was no other room available. My protestations that this was simply not good enough for a 4 start hotel who had already had the benefit of my advance payment was met with another shrug- so end of the manager's interest.  When later wanting to discuss further with the manager, I saw him glance at me from a distance and walk rapidly the other way totally disinterested.  There then followed two virtually sleepless nights for my wife and I as we had to endure the riotous shouts and general carousing of the enthusiastic students enjoying all the fun of the flight of steps outside our room until 3 a.m....  So from what should have been a positive review about the many pleasant aspects of the hotel, my review is the opposite and is one is a total disappointment due to one man - the manger.  To claim that there is any part of a commercial a c system that is 'impossible' to obtain in a brief time in an island as large as Sicily or which is so close to all the commercial and industrial refrigeration suppliers in the Italian mainland is a complete nonsense - and had he not heard of DHL... I suggest that the manager is far more interested in reducing his hotel's maintenance costs to the detriment of his clients. A very poor experience.","20569":"Neat entrance. Friendly reception. Our hotel room (especially the bathroom) is rather outdated, but that applies to 90% of all Italian hotels. We chose this hotel because in pictures we saw that it was not adjacent to an insanely busy road, but to stately stairs that looked empty and quiet. Unfortunately, outdoor terraces are set up there in the evening and there's live (!) music. If you are a light sleeper, demand a room at the back or look for another hotel.","20571":"Having arrived during a spell of very hot weather, most of our group were in rooms with no air conditioning. Speaking to the manager, I suggested that, if he couldn't fix the problem, at least provide fans in the affected rooms. His reply was that the problem was only for a few days. Checking on Trip Advisor, I found that the problem had been around since July! I asked him about this. His reply was a smile and a shrug. The rest of the staff were very good but somewhat restricted about making any improvements because management didn't really care knowing that we would only be there for a couple of nights. A couple who arrived earlier than the tour, when they realised there was no AC in their room, complained and were told that there were no other rooms. After a heated discussion, a free room was miraculously found that did have AC. Service at the Principe was like pulling teeth! Location was excellent. Food acceptable.","20573":"Stayed one night at the start of our tour. Our room was nicely furnished and had a small balcony overlooking the street. This was semi-pedestrianised and so quiet in the evening. Hotel is well sited for local restaurants and other town centre attractions. Breakfast was continental style but offered eggs, bacon, etc and was good quality. Main drawback is the air conditioning. Rooms have high ceilings whIch seems to put a strain on the system. A pleasant place to stay nevertheless.","20577":"Very poor experience. Specifically:  1. Breakfast buffet was awful - badly stocked with rotten eggs in scrambled offering. No places laid, had to wait for cutlery and staff expressed annoyance when asked for salt and pepper.  2. Bar shut at 9pm on Saturday night  3. Internet so intermittent as to be useless  4. Lights falling off walls. Blown bulbs.  Generally an impression of could not care less for clients.  Very curious check in experience - the check in desk operator was sweating heavily and tried to give us one room when we had booked two.","20578":"i stayed in the hotel 25 and 26 October and found both the hotel rooms and the location below satisfactory level. The hotel is old and isolated though it is close to the sea. The room has a terrace with a nice view but even this didnt satisfy me with the service level. it is roughly 8 km to the Palermo city center and there are not many restaurants around. i reccomend visitors to find more new and centrally located hotels.","20579":"Had a great couple of nights here. Room lovely and clean, breakfast selection very good. Staff friendly and courteous. English quite good. Right in the centre, so close to everything. You can't get lost, honestly. Fabulous stay.","20580":"Good: The hotel is in a very central location, its only about 2-3 mins walk to the main piazza yet on a quieter side road. The room we got has a very decent size, plenty space for 2 people. Breakfast options were good though the hot food was never hot, say lukewarm was even hard.  Bad: The wifi is pretty bad, took ages to connect then it keeps dropping off and super slow, I basically couldn't use the wifi, just used my mobile data all the time.  There was just 1 pillow per person and no spares in the wardrobes either and yet the pillows are so flat that you can't even feel you're sleeping on a pillow. I asked for extra pillows and did get them to be fair.  There is no tea coffee making facilities in the room, and even if you request a kettle they won't supply.  Shower pressure is not stable, especially our last day of stay, I could barely have a shower as the water just like dripping.  Lastly, we ended our trip in Catania in a very bad experiences as when we checked out we asked if the hotel could call us a taxi to go to the bus station and how much will that cost. The reception was nicely said of course they can call us a taxi and the cost from hotel to the bus station would be a flat charge of 10 euros. I did look at on google map it says 1.7km so 10 euros sounds ok to us. However, when we were getting off the taxi we were charged double - 20 euros. We can do nothing but to pay at that stage as the bus we want to get on was leaving shortly.  We then communicated this to the hotel but we then got all sorts of stories such as the differences were tips, we made extra trips in between, the driver had given the 10 euros to us directly, then later another email saying no the money wasn't given to us directly but was given to the bus driver to give it to us. I couldn't believe how good of a story making a person can be. Of course none of them were true as how could we tip a taxi driver 5 euros for a 10 euro trip? How would he know which bus we were getting on which bus driver is it? We waited for the bus before it arrived then got on straight away and the bus departed straight after there was no one giving any money to the bus driver, but again in a common sense, would you do that? After we were ripped off, all the communications we got from the hotel actually reads to us that we were lying the whole way through. We are well travelled in the world and been to Italy 3 times in different regions, this is by far the worst we've had.  The point is not on the 10 euros is how everything was handled and the pack of lies we were getting and also implying in the communication that we were the liars rather.  I'm sure the hotel will have their own side of story whether true or not, but I feel I need to let other readers know what happened to us.","20592":"My husband and I have just returned from a week\u2019s holiday in Catania, Sicily. We stayed at Il Principe on Via Alessi for 6 nights in a Deluxe room with a balcony, which we paid extra for for the Deluxe. We stayed in room 126 is on the first floor, a corner room which was spacious and clean. The clean team where great at keeping our room spotless.  Because we are were staying so long we were allowed to order room service as a courtesy.  There is a nice bar downstairs off the main reception.  Breakfast is great a combination of hot food and continental, and there was plenty of it, with waiters checking and refilling constantly. I am appalled to read poor reviews of the breakfast - they are simply unfounded!  This is a great hotel to stay in due to its location, Via Etna is a 6 min walk. Taxis to the hotel are only 20mins and cost about 30 Euros.  Special thanks to Stefano who was courteous and helpful at all times. He had handy tips about where to go and importantly where not to go as a visitor.  Would I stay here again, yes!  Catania is a wonderful city with fantastic historic sites to visit and fab places to dine out.","20598":"Overall this hotel is well located in the heart of the city, minutes away from the main food market where you can eat well and watch the hustle and bustle. Access to shops and main tourist attractions are not far either along with restaurants and a laundromat if you need!  On the other hand, I wouldn\u2019t say service is their number one priority. The breakfast options were the absolute worst I have seen in all the 3 weeks I\u2019ve been in Italy.  Our friends A.C wasn\u2019t working well and they did nothing to fix it during this heat wave.  Lastly, the \u201cvalet\u201d is basically the hotel parking our car on the street in front. So we paid for what exactly?? No idea...","20600":"Check in was friendly and professional. Room was very comfortable and nicely decorated. Breakfast was good. Staff was helpful when we needed extra pillow. Wake up call was prompt. Location is excellent.","20603":"We had stayed here 4 years ago and really enjoyed it but this time the hotel appeared very tired. Some of the rooms are better than others and most needing a refurbishment. The check in and check out process was difficult because I had booked multiple rooms for our group. The hotel is very central and easy walking distance to main attractions, shops and restaurants.","20605":"My family stayed here for several days and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The hotel is in a perfect location which was an easy walk to all restaurants, shops and sights.  Rooms were well appointed and spacious (for Italy). My room had a stocked fridge, desk, air conditioning, safe, walk in shower, comfortable bed and wardrobe, Complimentary toiletries were also provided.  Housekeeping was of a good standard and breakfast was satisfactory.  The location is the best in Catania.  The outstanding aspect of this hotel are the wonderful staff. They were friendly, professional and incredibly hospitable. My father required hospitalisation during his stay and the staff were so caring and went out of their way to help my mother. They were genuinely caring and offered assistance well above expectations. They were a wealth of information helping us with restaurants, beaches, hospitals, hairdressers and taxis.  Thank you for a wonderful stay and providing outstanding service to my family.","20608":"Hotel has a classy and formal feel about it but service staff are friendly and efficient. Good, spacious and clean room. Very comfortable. So central to everything - strolling distance to Piazza del Duomo, morning street market and the shopping street of via Etnea. My son's shoes split after we checked in and he was able to hobble over to via Etnea and buy a new pair. So glad.","20612":"Within walking distance of the Main Center of the city where the Church is. Excellent service for our 2 days here.  Nice beds and bathrooms, great breakfast and nice bar for relaxing. Rooms are interesting with ceiling reliefs. Hotel is located in 2 building, entrance to second building across street is around and under stairs. elevators in both buildings.","20615":"Bad start with the big small man on the front desk seemed determined to make life difficult insisting that our group eats breakfast at a time of his choosing. We ignore him of course and the breakfast service copes OK. I get a proper coffee without difficulty and the buffet is halfway decent. Good location.","20619":"We stayed here as part of a group and our room was appalling it was so small dark and depressing the electrics were dodgy we reported the faults to reception and nothing was done and the staff generally were slow surly and on helpful. The breakfast was extremely poor","20624":"I\u2019m not sure that this should be listed as a four star hotel - maybe three and a half. My room was very comfortable. The staff was professional and very, very helpful. The breakfast was fine and quite extensive. The hotel is very close to all the attractions.","20626":"Walking into the hotel you will notice a lingering smell of cheap perfume. This never goes away, and is likely to mask an unpleasant smell. Check in was smooth and the front desk associates were polite and helpful.  The room was terrible. The furniture was old; decoration was tired and unattractive; the mattress was lumpy. The bathroom was small and the shower stall was dirty. You could not relax in the room. Just close your eyes and pray for morning.","20627":"The staff are very accommodating, super friendly and helpful.  The beds are not comfortable. Our \u2018double bed\u2019 was two twin beds pushed together with separate covers and during the night the beds pushed away from one another. The mattresses themselves are very hard, covers suck and the pillows are even worse.  Rooms are hot at night and the fan wouldn\u2019t work in our room.  The shower would go in and out from extremely hot to cool water temperatures; but the pressure was good.  The \u2018roof top terrance\u2019 is a couple of dirty tables and some chairs...there is no urge to hang out up there; it\u2019s a shame because it has nice views of the area. There is also an old outdoor shower that hasn\u2019t been used in years up there.  The breakfast is decent; nothing memorable.  The gym is only a single elliptical and it was broken when we were there.  You are right in the heart of the city center when staying at this hotel but we took a Vespa to Taormina and I wish we stayed in this city instead. The downtown area is not as dirty and has better shops + atmosphere.","20628":"This place is awful. Outside appearance is deceiving. When we went to our room, the hallway rugs had huge old stains. Doors to room had to be practically slammed in order to close. Inside needs major renovation. Older curly hair receptionist is very rude and obnoxious. We were so unsatisfied with reception and out dated rooms that we went out and looked for alternative stay then came back and cancelled reservations. Buyer beware!","20631":"Currently staying at hotel as part of a five night stay, room is very spacious, but lacks storage. Bathroom small but OK. Breakfast has lots to choose from, but get down early for hot food. Staff extremely helpful and polite. English is very good. Only downside is our room is near a pub club, which was playing very loud music until early hours! But other than that, can highly recommend.","20633":"The rooms were terrible. Our room stank from urine, in another room the bed broke, on another room the door to the bathroom didn't close. the glass windows in two other rooms were broken. The fridge in our room didn't work and wasn't fixed although I asked. It was changed nearly before we left, when we didn't need it anymore. And - the air-conditions didn't work in some of the rooms or hardly worked. There was a very thin pillow for each person. The receptionists were extremely rude and uncooperative. The only good things were the two restaurants - on the first floor and on the 14th floor","20635":"Well, where to start? The rooms were not cleaned at all, dirt all over the carpet, especially under the bed. Temperature in the shower went from hot to cold and back again all the time, not very comfortable. The cleaning lady was pleasant though. Breakfast was not good, pretty much only low budget sweets and cakes. I was expecting some nice Italian cheese and ham but not even that did they have. The hotel was located outside Palermo so you had to take a cab to the city which was \u20ac15-20. The almost worst part was the poolguy, he was angry and rude ALL THE TIME. He should not work with service and people at all. Even the, what it looked like, hotel manager was up and yelling at him, very unprofessional. I\u2019ve been at hundreds of hotels, but this hotel I would never in my life recommend.","20638":"Great location and a professionally run hotel with a classic style in keeping with Italy. Stayed two nights prior and then added 3 as part of a tour group, so five nights and all went to plan in accommodation and treatment. Everything was comfortable and pleasant staff, with the hotel just a short even walk to the main Duomo piazza. I don't think you could do much better. I would have liked tea and coffee facilities but hopefully all of Europe will get on to this service eventually. Breakfasts were a fantastic assortment and good coffee. The best. Oh and on the last night return from my tour I was given a room at the back of the main hotel and this was smaller and not as nice. Initially I had a room in the connecting building across, via a walkway, and this building has lovely rooms. Pity about the last night.","20639":"Second long stay at this hotel based on its relatively good rate compared to other hotels in Palermo in summer and the rooftop pool with amazing views 360 degrees around. Breakfast is also good. Many people complain about its location but for me it is ideal, not far from a stone beach and still walkable to the city center. Rooms are clearly dated but for me no problem. A bit dark also. This time I had a tenth floor view over the sea which was amazing every morning. Even room numbers have sea views, the other side is for short staying bus passengers mostly with city (apartment building) views. I paid around 800 Euro for three weeks BB while other similar hotels charge around 2000 Euro for this period of the year so I think it is very fine. Reception staff are OK but could get a lesson in smiling and friendliness although I think it has mostly to do with not speaking that many languages... Good secure parking opportunities as well so ideally for me my favourite hotel in my budget for Palermo. A special thank you for the friendliness of the small older pool guy who is always busy trying to make people enjoy there even though it is sometimes stress for him with the Italian rules of wearing bathing caps and the closure of the pool between 1 and 3 PM. This time I had no problems with my room fridge and room airco. Wifi was OK, even in the room.","20640":"As a tourist the thing I love is visiting different countries and experiencing different cultures. Well....if any of the reception staff at this hotel came to London and spoke to us the way they did ..I would die. The staff at this hotel are extremely rude, unhelpful and don\u2019t go out of their way to make sure you are Can move around the city. Rude, rude and rude. Floor 4 has been renovated and is very nice. Very comfortable but as I said...rude staff.","20641":"A very good hotel just off via Etnea with spacious, clean room including the ensuite bathroom. The service at reception was very welcoming, informative and supportive. Breakfast was good consisting of both English and continental with especially fresh croissants. The only slight disappointment was a request for lactose free milk which was not seen to. Otherwise, a great weekend stay! I would recommend it and would stay again!","20643":"I just spent two nights at this hotel. It is located close walking distance to Piazza Duomo, restaurants and the shopping on Via Etna so that makes it a good location. It's a hundred meters or so off of the main path of traffic on Via Etna so it's a bit more quiet than being on the main road. The room was nice and the bed was pretty comfy. There was only one thing that was a small nuisance, the water temperature in the shower of my room (129) would fluctuate from warm to super hot and back to warm again, just be alert and ready to move out of the scalding water which could be a general water pressure issue. The staff was nice and the breakfast was good. Overall I would stay at this hotel again.","20646":"This hotel has a decent lobby, staff is OK, except Rene the person in charge of accommodations who is great. However, god forbid, if you do not get the remodeled rooms which are far and few, you will have a room with dirty old carpet, damaged furniture and absolutely not acceptable accommodation for someone with moderate standards. This hotel needs to get remodeled. The restaurant is pretty since is very high up and with nice view of Palermo, food mediocre. The location of this property is very bad and not safe after dark. Taxi is 15 Euro just for center of town one way.","20648":"We were nearly 30 persons at this central hotel in Catznia for the feast of St Agatha. The break fast was brilliant. The rooms were clean with all the facilities. The staff and the receptions were very helpful in all aspects.","20651":"A great hotel experience. Good things  not-so-good-things- the breakfast is delicious and plentiful lacking fresh fruit which in this climate and area is baffling. Look for fruit vendors to the right as you exit hotel. The pool is in a cool photo worthy location and the regular lifeguard is a nice friendly guy they don\u2019t mention you need a swim cap(for sale there 1.50\u20ac) and the nonstop europop can wear you out! Staff is very receptive to requests for extra towels etc some things lost in translation if you don\u2019t speak Italian (which is my bad anyway) Ask for a room which has been refreshed. They are in process of doing the entire place, but meanwhile there\u2019s no comparison. Our room, 406, had a wonderful sea view and very comfortable new beds and rain head shower. You can \u201ceasily\u201d walk along the sea into the old town area, be advised that the streets dirty and the sidewalks when available are narrow, but we felt safe at all times. Sum up\u2014 I would definitely stay here again","20653":"Good morning.  First of all i would like to say that we were a family that stayed in room 1023-1025 and the one who's leaving a review here is a Front Office Supervisor in a 5 Stars Hotel in London, which is me. We chose Palermo to enjoy our 10 days holidays and your hotel seemed to be our best choice so far. Check-in procedure: You guys being a 4 Stars, need to approach your check-in service more accurately, they didn't even say ''Welcome'' or ''Hi'' no wonder the bad reviews. Your receptionist asked us the name of the reservation which was under Lucian-Marian Grabovinschi and it took her about 5 minutes to finally find it after we gave her a confirmation from Expedia because, your system somehow turned the name as Grabovinschi Lucian and Marian being as a last name. There was no queue behind us, she only gave us the keys and took our ID's and Passports, she didn't even told us when they'll be returned, i had to ask for this matter. When i tried to ask about the amenities, breakfast time, bus tickets, she just told me they're busy now doing check-ins and that i should return later, as mentioned there was no queue, only us there. Rooms: I do understand you have different room categories but please, update your pictures on different travel agencies like booking.com, Expedia and so on, they look to polished and doesn't reflect the reality. The door from 1023 is squeaking ever since you unlock it, makes alot of noice, sounds like a mouse in pain. Beds are very comfortable. AC very noisy but at least it did it's job. I do recommend that you should do at least a yearly check on your room facilities just to check and fix the issues. Housekeeping should have a list of their own to spot these small issues and report them to reception.  Breakfast: Well, let's say for the first 2 days everything went well. Your breakfast staff should know english and trust me, you don't need to wait for every plate to finish on the buffet only then to fill it up again. This is how it went, we sat our mom and sister at the table and me with my partner we went right and left to bring coffee and fruits. One of your staff went to my mom and told her she can't sit at that table because the table is for 6 people. I went directly to your staff and she just nodded at me and left, not even to say sorry for that incovenience. Guys, you have so many tables empty when the breakfast is at the fullest and one of your so called breakfast staff which is suppose to help comes and mocks older people that don't speak italian, how come? There was this old guy who could barely moved in front of the coffee machine and barely knew english, was just asking everyone if they want cappuccino? I went myself alone with 3 cups to bring at our table and the guy just looked and me and pressed directly on the cappuccino option without even asking me what i would like. I took his cup and put it on the side and told him i can work it out myself, no need for assistance, technology is not a problem. Another day, another problem at the coffee machines, my turn in the queue to make my coffee and one of your ladies, she was with curly ginger hair, came to me half way on the process of making the coffee and she pressed on the screen ''STOP'' halfway at my first cup and i was left poker face, asked her why would she do that. She just starred at me and pointed me to the people behind me waiting in the queue, everyone was starring at her. If it's my turn at the coffee machine i don't think it was any problem with that, the attitude of your staff is so down and disappointing, why do they even work there? Do they get proper training? Is someone doing any check on them from time to time? For the 10 days we stayed, it never change beside some pies, everything was the same and it was never refilled quick enough, we had to wait until someone was grabbing the last slice of cheese or salami only then your staff would bring another one. I never ask for directions or places to visit in the city, but this time i just needed to know some information about the buses and tickets, your staff is not so well informed about this, they just told me i can buy tickets whenever i go in Palermo Centrale at any tobacco shop, but nowhere nearby the hotel. In one of the days when we went for all day out, we returned later in the night, to find in 1025 that the wall behind the door was hit and lots of dust was on the carpet. I called the reception and she was like ''Yeah fine, i 'll send someone'' and she hung up the call. I wont even start with the swimming pool experience, about your guy who doesn't speak english and he only yells at people in italian, like anyone would understand him, when you had 80% of the guys english speakers. None informed about wearing a cap in the pool, or that you should drag yourself out the sit to lay in the sun. The only staff i appreciate is the housekeeping for their cleaning and the bar staff, the rest doesn't even try to feel you welcomed, always starring at your like you stole something, that kind of look.  I 'm just suggesting that you guys, should definitely review most of your staff behaviour if you want to keep up being a 4 Stars accommodation and your TripAdvisor comments to be at least ''VERY GOOD'', if not just replace those who have no idea about customer service, they are there just to lay an eye for 8 hours and have an income without learning something.  If we were there for 2-3 days i don't know if i would've noticed so many stuff, but in 10 days, you can see the lack of professionalism, too bad for the building itself, but the implication is so poor to satisfy your customers.  Regards, Liviu Bostaca Supervisor @TheExhibitionistHotel in London","20672":"Visited with as part of a VJV tour. First visit fairly good, second visit very good - depends on your room which should be a newer one. Service was good on the first visit, excellent on the second: less crowded that time.  My ratings based on visit no. 2","20676":"This hotel is walking distance to all you need to see in Catania as we were on a tour we had dinner and breakfast at the hotel pre paid with the tour it was ok. The hotel room was good size and the bathroom was massive all you needed with the convenience of walking distance to everything We enjoyed the stroll around town you would only need a day to explore. Piazza was full of atmosphere all the time but the Resturants surroundings this were hard to find a seat.","20677":"Room 226 was large with a beautiful Baroque ceiling - had to take pictures. The room had wood floors, modern furnishings, great lighting, and a large bath. The water in the shower varied widely in temperature. We had 2 small balconies, but the view was not wonderful, just the street below. Breakfast was good but crowded - could have used a second coffee station. The location is a short distance from the main plazas so many sites, shopping, restaurants and bars were within easy walking distance. The front desk was helpful, but sometimes you had to track them down. The hotel lobby was a former castle and the building across the street (reached by tunnel from lobby) was built in early 1900 with the luxury of hot water in the rooms - the first hotel in the area to have this service.","20678":"Stayed for one night on VJV tour. 1st floor room was fine - a reasonable size if a bit soulless. Accessed via tunnel under the adjacent street. Lift very slow and quite a squeeze so faster to walk if you can Good breakfast. Central location but very quiet. Surrounding streets a little drab but not far from the nicer parts of town.","20679":"Where to start with this review. First the positives - the room was spacious, especially as we had a separate sitting room. The staff were friendly and the location was perfect to explore the city and close to good restaurants.  On our 2nd day we were hit by a massive storm - part of the foyer flooded (not the hotels fault) the hotel was also hit by lightning (again not their fault) which prevented us gaining access to our room because the electronic card readers did not work. The manager then gave us free drinks at the bar until we could get access. The only problem was that the electricals could not be fixed and it took 2 hours for the manager to work out that he should issue manual keys. All up it made the stay memorable and the manager did ok considering the foyer was underwater and hotel was hit by lightning.  The only real negative was that there was not toaster in the breakfast buffet and not enough natural light in the room.  But it was a memorable stay and I did enjoy myself","20681":"We stayed here for one night with our tour group and for two nights at the end, as a couple. This hotel is very central in Catania, convenient for sightseeing in the city. It would not be great if you have a car, as parking would be a nightmare, as it is located on the corner of a one-way street, has only space for maybe two cars outside, and even our experienced driver struggled to decant us and our luggage, from a mini-bus. Staff were very helpful, our room was fine for a short stay. Breakfasts generally were poor, not much selection of bread pastries, or fruit, or anything really, and quality was basic, especially by comparison to other places we stayed at. Basically a place for business tour groups for one-night stopovers. There is a very nice restaurant nearby, and a couple of reasonable places nearby that we ate at.","20691":"Travel info on how to get to this place was sent the morning of our arrival. We were already on the road and had no way to access that info. Luckily we were able to find it with little effort. I thought I had looked to make sure that we had a private bathroom but maybe I didn\u2019t. We had a room and there was a common bathroom down the hall. There were 4 keys which proved a bit cumbersome. The small one had to be inserted in the a lock inside the room to allow you to use electricity. Another key was needed to lock yourself in the room which meant the electricity, with the light, went off before you could figure out which key worked. Just a little annoyance when you went through this several times an evening. The a c cooled the room down nicely. There was a nightstand and table with electrical outlets on both sides of the bed. There was a light but it was so light it kept flipping over upside down. It was not possible to read a book or make our plans with this light, very cheap and annoying. There was one bar of soap and one small bottle of shampoo body wash in the closet along with the towels. There was a small desk which could be used during the daytime when the sun was out to use for light. We were told we could get a discount if we ate at their restaurant but we already had dinner reservations made a week prior. My husband used the shower down the hall. The water was cold. We informed the front seat and they told us that the water heater switch had probably been turned off. That switch was in the laundry room next door to the bathroom. In this small laundry room was also a toilet in case the one in the room with the shower was in use. I used the shower later and was able to get hot water. However mid-way through I started losing heat. When I adjusted the dial it went to scalding. I was able to play with it to get some warmth to get through my quick shower. The shower stall was very small and there was a small soap dish attached to the shower head. It was so flimsy that it fell when I placed my soap on it. There was a shelf next to the shower but that meant opening closing the door a lot which meant water getting on the floor. There was not much counter space but there were some small shelves. I\u2019m not sure when the area rug in front of the sink was last washed, but it looked pretty dingy to me. There was a community dispenser of soap by the sink. Thankful that we only spent one night here.","20699":"We have been at Corte dei Medici for 4 nights, tonight is our 5th and last night and we will be extremely sad to leave. The accommodation is really clean and close to everything you need and the staff are so polite and nothing is too much trouble! A special mention to \u2018Nirvana\u2019 always has a smile on her face and will help you with anything you need. We have stayed in many cities in Italy but this is probably one of our best stays and most liked places! Just fantastic in every way!!! See you soon!! :) Emma and Adi x","20722":"We stayed here for three nights. It is the perfect place to explore the city on foot :) room with the balcony was very convenient. We had a comfortable bed, big shower, little fridge and a place to sit. Breakfast is typical for Italy so don't expect vegetables and huge variety;) good enough. Very nice place for the weekend in Palermo!","20726":"The positive is that it was in the city center, close to the main attractions of the city. The room smells not so good, and not so clean. They always make the bed, and arranging our clothes, but they didn't cleaning up the floor. For me is it a little bit strange. It is very noisy. But in general it was okay, we stayed home only for sleeping.","20737":"I spent only one night there but I enjoyed it very much. First of all, it is located 5 minutes\u2019 walk from the old town so it is very close to all attractions, restaurants and bars. The room is small but comfortable with a nice bathroom. The bed was very comfortable. Staff is very friendly and helpful. Another plus is a breakfast included in the price. In general, good value for the price.","20799":"I recently went to Catania with a friend and we decided to stay at Casa di Elena since it was conveniently located. After driving around we stopped to ask for directions and a nice man showed us where the street was that we were looking for. We walked drove down and parked in the little parking area then continued to walk to where the b&b is located. There were no signs, no lights on and when I rang the buzzer no one answered. We continued around the corner and stayed at B&B Duca di Uzeda, which had signage and was open and very nice.","20813":"Nice clean room and centrally located. Reasonably priced and friendly helpful staff - our plane arrived very late in Catania and the Elios Rooms guys did their best for us. Good breakfasts in a light modern dining area too. Definitely five stars!","20819":"Its a very nice stay with friendly staff. Rooms are nicely furnished, perhaps lacking to put the coats on. Beds nice, temperature suiting. Hot showers. In the room was also fredge which we didnt expect. The rooms were nicely cleaned every day, breakfast was fine. Felt also very safe. Unfortunately you have to pay 20 \u20ac extra for night reception. If had to choose again, we would come here.  Location is perfect, you need to take just few steps to majority of Catania's attraction.","20855":"Very nice an fully renewed B&B.  Clean, with functional furniture, gorgeous bed and basic bathroom.  Despite the expecations, no breakfast was available in the venue.  It's perfect location made it easy to eat something in the lively markets nearby.","20902":"The room was immaculately clean, spacious and very comfortable. Location was perfect as we were able to walk to central parts of Catania. Breakfast was also really great with welcoming staff. We have already booked in for our next visit. Really great value for money- highly recommend","20935":"Accessed via an unassuming doorway next to a taverna, this very clean B&B has large comfortable rooms and is managed   owned by a charming gent who communicates via the amusing Google Translate - he is very chatty! Like many people in Sicily he only speaks Italian Sicilian. The location is excellent - everyone knows where this plaza is, it is served by many buses (buy a 1 euro ticket from the tabacci first) plus the airport bus and the open topped tourist bus. The nearest restaurant is an upmarket huge place with good food, including local specialties with a lovely garden. Round the corner is a small supermarket and many tavernas and shops. A slightly longer (10-15mins) walk takes you to the bustling heart of Catania with its fountains, historic buildings and amazing markets. Our room had a really nice bathroom (including a toilet with a seat - very unusual in Catania - the best other loo was at Catania railway station). The breakfast was nothing to write home about though adequate and served on a large roof terrace. All the staff were charming and good at miming! A fridge in the room really would have been a huge asset. Even if you don't like it, it's well worth going to the opera whilst there - it's relatively cheap and a box is cheaper then the stalls so you can take a break. Everyone who is everyone goes, and the average age is so much younger than you might expect. There are English surtitles and it's a laugh!","20945":"Travelled with my friend and stayed just the one night but wouldnt have minded staying for more. The B&B is so centrally located. Only a few rooms but imaculately clean and welcoming. The room was warm enough to make our stay a comfortable one. I would have however preffered a better quality of shower gel. The lady greeting us was lovely and explained all in detail. The breakfast was basic but the person there (her son) was more than helpful. This is an easy going place if you want to stay in Catania hassle free. Parked my car just outside in the square. It was as easy as that.","20956":"This was a great place to stay. Firstly Simona was incredibly helpful, and friendly throughout. She arranged a pick up for us from the rail station and a transfer to the docks when we were heading off to Malta by ferry ,with an equally helpful driver. Simona also sorted excursions to Taormina and Mount Etna ( you must go!) plus a couple of great restaurants . If you like seafood and character try \u2018Antico Marino\u2019 but you\u2019ll need to book a table. Also just round the corner in the \u2018Castle Square\u2019 is Da Antonio where good honest great value Sicilian family food is served. We went twice.  Our room was modern and comfortable, breakfast delicious including Sicilian marmalade , and the setting authentic.  Literally on the doorstep is the Teatro Antico Di Taormina which is a well preserved Greek Roman amphitheater  All things Catania and our excursions exceeded our expectations!","20961":"The B&B is located about 5 minutes walk away from the Duomo and the central piazza of Catania so it\u2019s ideal for a city break. The rooms are very clean and comfortable and nicely decorated. The staff were very friendly and helpful including booking a restaurant our first night and organising a taxi to the airport as we left, (at a very good rate). The downside, as other visitors have mentioned, is the lack of elevator. There are 82 steps to climb from the ground floor to the B&B rooms on the fourth floor. Luggage is hoisted up by pulley and there is a structure in place for the installation of an elevator but it\u2019s best to check beforehand whether this has actually been installed if you are concerned about access. We were told it was due to be finished this month (June 2019). Breakfast was very good.","20971":"My husband & I and two friends. Great location center of city. Very secure, extremely clean, attractive - don't be put off by the exterior of the building, inside is totally modern. The owner speaks English and is most kind & helpful. Our rooms were lovely with comfortable beds, big fluffy pillows, skylight windows, TV, great mirrors, wifi - well appointed bathroom (with hairdryer etc) Only drawback is it's on the 4th floor with no elevator (they carry your luggage up for you, & the stairs are wide & well lit)fortunately, they plan to have a lift put in before next year. ( otherwise I'd rate them a 5) we all slept Very well","20977":"I stayed here one week during my vacation and enjoyed both my room - with very good air conditioning- and nice atmosphere a lot. Suite was furnished elegant way and it was very clean. B&B is only few minutes walk from Piazza Duomo, so near \u201ceverything\u201d. I surely can recommend this place for staying a night or longer period.","20983":"The staff are among the most friendly and helpful people you will ever meet. The rooms are very clean,comfortable, and quiet and the maid service is phenomenal. The hotel is located within walking distance from the city\u2019s main attractions and the staff can recommend places to see, eat, etc.  The only negative aspect to this place is they have not yet installed a lift (although they are planning on it) and the rooms are located at the top of several flights of stairs. I would not recommend this place to anyone who has trouble climbing a lot of stairs but for everyone else, I would HIGHLY recommend staying here. The friendliness of the staff and the value for the price cannot be beat by anyone.","20984":"Do not be put off as you leave the street and enter the rather unattractive courtyard to walk towards the internal entrance and stairs. Just be prepared, it's a hike up nine separate flights! Sitting on the top floor is the welcoming Palazzo Sisto, a very contemporary, elegant and comfortable B&B. Our room was the Suite Pirandello, offering a very spacious, modern, quiet and comfortable bed and bath. Throughout our three nights stay we had the pleasure of meeting our hostess Dalia who was always very spirited, friendly and helpful. She was assisted by the always pleasant and friendly Rita, who facilitated with the typical Sicilian breakfast and ensured our room was always well maintained. The property is extremely well located in the center of Catania with virtually every sight within walking distance.","20986":"My partner and I just finished a three night stay at Palazzo Sisto.  The B&B is decorated in a beautiful contemporary style and is extremely clean and quiet. Located just a few block from the Duomo Square, it is an easy walk from the B&B to almost all the major sites in Catania. Dalia, the manager of the B&B, was absolutely lovely and could not be more helpful. She spoke English well and made meaningful recommendations about places we should visit in Catania and restaurants where we should eat. She is full of energy, very approachable and highly likable. She clearly enjoys her job and wants guests to have a pleasant and problem-free stay.  The B&B is also staffed by a very friendly Nigerian woman named Rita, who is responsible for cleaning the apartments and preparing breakfast. I typically don\u2019t comment about cleaning women in my Trip Advisor reviews. However, Rita is truly amazing. She is the best cleaning woman we have every had in any B&B or hotel we have ever stay in. In fact, I think she cleaned our room better than my own mother would have cleaned it. When we returned to the room after our first night out, everything we had left out on all of the counters and all of our clothes we left out were neatly packed away. The room looked like it did when we walked into it for the first time. She even folded my personal underwear! (Talk about going above and beyond!)  During our first night at the B&B, we were the only guests at the B&B. (Remember that it is January and off season for Catania.) As we are two men, staying in the B&B by ourselves didn\u2019t bother us at all. I\u2019m not sure how other people would feel about spending the night there alone. The B&B is located on the third floor of a building. To enter the B&B, you must enter a security code in a keypad. Each room at the B&B has a key lock. We felt completely safe, despite the fact that no one else was there.  As we were the only guests our first night, we were given a breakfast voucher for a local patisserie. The patisserie provided us with a pastry and coffee tea cappuccino. As there were other guests at the B&B our next two nights, breakfast was provided at the B&B and consisted of yogurt, breads, cheeses, meats, juices, croissants, etc. We certainly felt there was plenty of food to eat for breakfast and Rita went out of her way to make sure we had everything we needed and were happy.  The B&B provides Wi-fi. The Wi-fi went down our first night but was quickly restored the next day by Dalia. We had no other problems with the Wi-F- during our stay. The Wi-fi connection speed is average.  The only drawback to the B&B..and the only reason I\u2019m not giving it a 5 star review...is that it is not accessible. Guests have to walk up to the second floor. As it\u2019s an old building, the second floor is really the third floor from the perspective of the stairs. Guests have to walk up a series of 9 consecutive short staircases to reach the top. Each time I did this, my heart was racing and I had to stop and catch my breath when I reached the top level. I could really feel the burning of the muscles in my legs, too. Dalia told us that they have applied for a permit to install an elevator in the middle of the large staircase - and there is certainly enough room to put in such an elevator. Until they install an elevator, people with ambulation issues (people who use canes, etc.) should probably consider another housing options while in Catania.  Beside the lack of an elevator, we really enjoyed our stay at Palazzo Sisto. We will definitely stay there on our next trip to Catania!","20988":"First of all, the place is exceptional clean, modern and central as someone else has stated. It was a very comfortable place to rest after walking the streets all day in exploration. The staff was very friendly and provided great recommendations for food and or sites to check out. My only regret is not spending more time here and in Catania itself. Pull the trigger on this place...","21015":"This family run Hotel overlooking a rocky beach is spectacular. The staff is extremely friendly and always helpful. The rooms are specious and clean. There are restaurants within walking distance to choose from. Definitely recommend it.","21027":"We really loved the view of the room, and the patio. Very relaxing and quiet place. We were also able to get a transport to and from the airport. Overall, I wished we would have stayed here longer. Very relaxing.","21028":"This place was sparkling new! Rooms were very spacious and well appointed with a mini kitchen too. The bathroom was lovely with a powerful shower. Very clean. The only weird thing is that the only bed option was a sofa bed, it was moderately comfortable. This place certainly is very good value compared to other places in the area. If you want to stay in Aci Castello I\u2019d definitely recommend this place!  Staff spoke perfect English. The receptionist (her name was Lou.. something long!.. sorry!) was super friendly with lots of advice about where to visit in Sicily. The aircon in the room broke and we were moved to an upgraded sea view room (which was super!!).  Breakfast a nice continental option with boiled eggs and croissants. Etc.  Beach not accessible from the hotel, but you can sit on the rocks or patio area and look out to sea.  Just up the road (on the other side) is the Sheraton. You can use the outdoor pool and beach access for 15 Euro if you like and buy a ticket for the hop on   hop off bus that will take you to into Catania. (Pay 5 Euro in the hotel and 10 on the bus).  Tip: DON\u2019T get a taxi to Aci Castello from the airport - it\u2019s quite far and cost me more than the hotel! 60 Euro!! Unfortunately being a lone woman at night I felt I didn\u2019t want to get the bus on my own. Pre-book your transfer or if in the day, get the bus!  Get a sea view room with balcony!","21029":"We were there on a family emergency, the staff could not be more helpful, kind and considerate. The hotel is not overwhelming, very personable,very secure and comfortable, perfect for what we needed. Nice breakfast and beautiful patio area. Convenient kitchen in the room. Was only there one week, we left feeling like family with the staff. Our relatives are still there and are continued to be treated the same. A real gem of a place.","21063":"Sleep Inn rooms in Catania is located in the heart of the city. If you have limited time in the city, you can discover by walk. Room was clean. The employees were helpful especially Julia. They have helped us during check-in and check-out.","21066":"Excellent location in the main center of Catania. Duomo and fish market is in 1 min walk also restaurants. Clean, confortable and smart room. Kind receptionist and cleaning personnel. We stayed for only one night and it was ideal! Baby coat was available. To repeat and recommend. The worst was that is difficult to find and the building is in rehabilitation but the room is in perfect conditions!","21071":"Placed in the very heart of the city center , the Sleep Inn Catania Rooms is the perfect option for an accommodation in Catania . The rooms are furnished with a simple and sober style . A very outstanding and professional service provided by the staff it\u2019s also the keypoint that made my stay in the Sleep Inn . Highly recommended!","21082":"Stayed here in September for 5nights had a fantastic stay room was clean a tidy maid service everyday Hosts very friendly &helpful can\u2019t comment on breakfast as we didn\u2019t have any , great location ,would definitely recommend a stay here :grinning:","21103":"The B&B was an excellent choice for a recent 4 night stay in Catania. The location was excellent on a small street just off the Duomo cathedral and the historic university square. The hosts were were very helpful, the room with a balcony was good sized, and the breakfast coffee was excellent.","21105":"We visited Al Quadrato D\u2019Oro for our holiday in Sicily. It has a great location, in the city center, close to everything.  The staff, Antonio and his wife were really helpful and friendly. They recommended us a few places, what to see, where to eat, which Etna trip to choose. The breakfast was included in the price - delicious caffee and pistachio cream :)  The room was spacious for 3 guest with nice and clean bathroom.  We had a lovely stay here, I think, if we come back to Catania one day, we will choose this place again. Highly recommended!","21107":"We visited Al Quadrato D\u2019Oro for our only night in Catania. It was in a great location - close to one of the main shopping streets and a 15 minute walk from the train station.  The staff were really friendly and helpful. They recommended a couple of places to eat nearby which were really nice. They also showed us a couple of the main sights we should try to fit in.  The room was quite spacious with a nice balcony and a decent-sized bathroom (good shower!) There was a great choice of food for breakfast too.","21111":"I enjoyed my stay at their B&B. The room was nice sized and breakfast was very good, especially for Italian standards, which is typically sweets. The hosts were very kind and helpful. Would stay again and I recommend to those considering staying there.","21115":"We were a group of ten people from Jersey and from the moment we booked we had absolutely no problem at all. Antonio contacted me on the day to check what time we were arriving He was there to help with the luggage. The rooms were clean and spacious and on the first night we were leaving early in the morning so we were able to help ourselves to breakfast. On the second visit we had a good breakfast. Staff couldn't have been more helpful. Most amazing thing though is the location. Absolutely perfect for exploring central Catania on foot. Highly recommended.","21214":"A big double room with all the commodities, well located if you pretend to be close to the main hub (bus+train), and not far from city center. Very friendly staff. Nice place for a Etna explorer adventure.","21231":"The first time Iw ent by the Hotel just to have a look, because I booked a room for one night the following week. And it happend, that I was in town already for a day. The first look wasn't very pleasant. Also on the day I booked the room I was sceptical, but when I finally found the entrance ( I didn't bring the adress with me) I was really surprised to enter in a real italian courtyard with loads of plants. The host is a very friendly dutch guy living in Catania for almost 35 years.speaking very well German and Englisch (don't know about other languages) He has a map for you and explains what's going on in town. The room (shared bathroom) was painted in beautiful colours and nicely decorated. Very clean and quiet as the window was facing the courtyard. Definitely a place to spend more time than one night.","21233":"We`ve got only a room with shared bathroom. Although we were out of season in Catania (November), the B&B was fully booked. Hans the owner is really cozy & nice. Both - our room & the bathroom - were fine. Only one problem: one of the beds smelled badly, so that we had to share one bed. No idea what it was, that`s tough luck. Hans does not offer breakfast, but the rooms are fitted with water kettle, coffee & teabags, little cakes. So you`ve got a first start in the day. Also mentionable: the shared bathroom is big & disability-friendly. Furthermore the accommodation has a really interesting salon & WLAN. The B&B is a few minutes from the city centre cathedral square.","21234":"We were very happy with our stay at Holland International - the owner was very helpful explaining where to get the bus to the airport and generally helping however he could,  The room was very clean and a really nice size. Though right on Catania's main street the hostel is back from the road and very quiet.  Would definitely recommend.","21235":"We''ve been lucky to find this place! It is just few minutes walking from the main historical city center and there is a free private parking (that s a great thing in a city!). From the outside it was a bit messy, even if I actually appreciated the tipical dutchentrance :D, but the inside is a step back to the 17th, with great ceilings fully decorated. The owners (a dutch-italian couple) are really helpful and nice people. The price of the room was nice and the place clean and quit enough. I really recommend this place especially if you want to visit all the east side of the island and the volcano.","21236":"One of the many hotels located between the train   bus station and city centre. Unfortunately, the owners' friendliness & helpful nature did not fully compensate for the kitsch furnishings of both the guest room and common areas...this however, may be a matter of taste. Our room is best described as cheap and cheerful, complete with a fitted plastic-roofed bathroom. The poor quality bed & bedding do little for our sleep quality, as did the renovations in the building courtyard just outside our window. A peek into the less than clean shared bathroom made me glad we paid for an en suite toilet.","21241":"We spent 2 nights here. Very happy. Large room with ensuite. Comfortable bed. Large tasty breakfast. Caterina and Giulio very welcoming. Beautiful huge ancient tree fills the courtyard. Free secure parking most appreciated. Quite hard to find property behind petrol station. Heavy rain found a leak into our room. But Julio was most helpful. Sadly, language was something of a barrier between ourselves and Julio. But would strongly recommend this B&B. Un p\u00e8lerin","21247":"We stayed for 4 nights. wonderful hosts. Very accommodating. We enjoyed our stay and didn't want to leave. Secure packing. Hidden away behind metal gates. You wouldn't know it was there. Lovely courtyard with fruit trees. Large bedroom with ensuite. A wonderful place to stay.","21248":"Near The AirPort in Catania. Lovely and friendly personal. Give is a good sicilian vine in The evening. Good and quit rooms with perfect beds. And a big and wonderful breakfast in The morning. Not so many restaurera in The area bit IF you walk 15 minutes its no problem to have a Nice dinner.","21253":"Well worth seeking out. Don't be dismayed , get the 4 - 7 bus from the station to the football stadium (Spengoli). This wonderful accommodation is truly hidden behind at the back of the local petrol station near the football stadium car park. The rooms are lovely, quiet, comfortable and overlook a private garden area. Catherine the host is very attentive and the breakfast is more than plentiful. It is a good 20 minutes walk to the city centre or 45 mins to the bus   train station. But local buses run frequently, from the football stadium, for 1 euro, to the city centre or the stations. Remember you will need too buy your tickets from a tobaconist in advance. We found a lovely restaurant just behind the house just 50 metres away, ( Carboni Ardent ) well worth the visit. Other than that there are no restaurants in the area, so it does mean trips back and forth to the city centre. Enjoy this hidden oasis, but be prepared to have to travel to the tourist sights as it is quite, remote.","21263":"I am victimized by Best Western who give their name brand to this international branch and then claim no responsibility to help out the customer to protect its right. We had upfront paid for this hotel - Best Western Mediterraneo Catania and short after COVID outbreak hit Italy and we wanted a refund. They initially said they would pay the refund although it was a non-refundable rate then they took it too slow until a time came they showed Italian legislature as an excuse to refuse refunding but instead provided a voucher although I emphasized so many times that we can't make any plans to visit Italy for touristic purposes for next 12 months any more. This is basically confiscation of our 504 Euro money during a economically sensitive time where everybody is affected. Best Western US office is absolutely saying there is nothing they can do, even a simple request such as at least help modify the voucher as redeemable in US, but as simple as it is I am brushed off. Why do they give their trade name to that hotel if that hotel will not follow Fair Trading Act ? The only reason we chose that hotel is that there was Best Western name there. Total disappointment, I am still looking for ways to get back what I own.","21267":"Very clean rooms and polite staff but there is no privacy. Walls are super thin and it is noisy. Breakfasts are ok. Only staff members at reception know english others speak only italian. Be careful with traffic. In my experience drivers are crazy. If you want to take a taxi from the centre (via Etnea) to the hotel you'll have to pay 15\u20ac.","21271":"Having read reviews carefully we booked BW Mediterraneo for 4 nights as our base for visits around Catania. I agree the staff were excellent The breakfast was nothing special which surprised me - coffee awful, though they will gladly bring from a machine but still poor - cereals terrible though fruit is good, pastries ok if you lucky to get the good stuff   hot water for tea just a bit better than warm - but maybe we were just unlucky. Room comfortable   clean with plenty hot water and good towels. Pretty noisy but we are in a city. Internet (for Sky tv) most inconsistent, dropping out regularly. Initially thought location not great but decided it is actually quite good if you happy to walk 10 minutes (. Which we were) though the Catania streets are not conducive for strolling about after dark   though we didn\u2019t encounter any problems. We found this a very busy city (10th largest in Italy) and would choose some where else to tour out of in the future.","21276":"As we were planning a trip to Mount Etna, we needed a hotel in Catania the night before. The Best Western Hotel Mediterraneo was a very good choice. The room was well appointed with a lovely comfortable bed. They had Sky TV with a great selection of English channels. Even though we had to leave quite early, breakfast hours started at 7 am so we had lots of time to avail ourselves of the delicious hot and cold buffet. For no extra charge, we were able to leave our car in their secure garage for the entire day which was very convenient. We were delighted how this hotel suited all our needs.","21279":"The location was great for a grocery store, places to eat and shop, and get to the centre square, We found it reasonably quiet and a decent size room. Breakfast for 4 euro was very good. Front desk staff were friendly and helpful.","21280":"Surprised to find that booking directly through Best Western\u2019s central reservations was cheaper (95 euros) than any deal offered through the booking services that work with Trip Advisor (140 euros range). Very nice hotel. Well maintained. Clean. Lots of choices for the breakfast that\u2019s included in the price of the room. Helpful staff. Location a relatively easy walk to key tourist sites and main shopping street. Only drawback is that the hotel is a mix of smoking and non-smoking rooms.","21285":"The staff made it very easy to make the reservation. They had my details from a previous visit so it was super simple. The hotel has some private parking just across the road which is very convenient if you're travelling with a car. The room was a very generous size very clean and comfortable. We even had a small terrace. Breakfast was plentiful had us well set up for another day going around the city. Just a block or two away there is a collection of restaurants that serve delicious food and are very reasonably priced.","21289":"I stayed here for a couple of nights, and was very pleased. The staff is friendly and helpful, and the rooms are comfortable and well equipped with all the usual amenities. The breakfast buffet, which is included in all bookings, is quite impressive with fresh baked pastries and plenty of standard items. The hotel is located on a quiet street, and is about a 10 minute walk to the pedestrian area, and a 20 minute walk to the metro station.","21292":"From Catania airport, we took the Alibus for \u20ac4 per adult. The Alibus stop is quite a walk from the hotel so a taxi is a much better if you have luggage or kids. On arrival at the hotel everything was fantastic. Customer, service, facilities, cleanliness. Breakfast is served from 7am to 10am. We had some fantastic cappuccinos & sorbets; almond sorbet; double coffee sorbet & pistachio sorbet. Breakfast was not included in our original booking, so we had to pay \u20ac3 a day, but it was very good value for the money. Our friends had breakfast included in their booking, so I guess it a matter of choice. We had no iron in our room but there\u2019s a small fee if you need laundry services. We used street parking nearby but one morning we found car had been ransacked on Ughetti Street (nothing to do with the hotel); So I will recommend looking for a safe car park nearby. This fantastic hotel had fitnesses facilities & after checking out our luggage were kept safely for us as we went shopping downtown. On our return, a taxi was arranged for us within minutes. Taxi fare to the airport is \u20ac20. There were a few free WiFi networks to choose from & also phones charging are readily available at the reception sitting area We totally enjoyed our stay at BW Mediterraneo, Catania :blush:","21301":"Best Western is always good for a certain standard of quality. No different here in Catania. A nice room with everything you need, including good wifi and a very nice breakfast. The location is in walking distance from the old center and you can see everthing on foot in a reasonable time. Thre are limited parking places, so if you are unlucky you need to go to a parking elsewhere, about 7 mins waling where you can park for 16 euros per night.","21302":"From before I arrived at the hotel, when I requested a quiet room, the staff were great. They are super helpful and very pleasant. I had a big room which was quiet, had a balcony where I sat in the evening, and not facing the busy side. Breakfast was fine. Overall an excellent experience","21304":"This hotel is great for group stays and business travelers. The rooms seem like they aren't brand new but aren't old looking or feeling either. My room was huge and I was staying with a friend, so we had two twin beds in the center. Sky network was available on an LG TV, the room also came with a large and comfortable couch, a desk, 3 desk chairs, a generous balcony, full size mirror, kettle with free cups sugar tea coffee creamer, mini fridge, safe, suitcase bench, a closet and a very decent bathroom with a great Mediterranean tile finish. You honestly really get your moneys worth staying here. Lifts are small but we stayed for 2 weeks and never broke once, stairs are convenient, lobby has good workspace, bar, front desk, free charging a free book shelf and internet access as well as concierge amenities. I never saw the front desk left unattended and the GM always came in to check on my group and I and make sure that we were situated well, always asking us what we needed and if we would like more food and if we were okay. They let all 20 something of us leave huge suitcases here for a couple of days without an issue. Whole hotel is very clean and tidy, staff were always friendly. There is a fitness room that requires key card access on the first floor. Blinds are automated and decoration isn't boring, which I appreciated for the long stay. Everything is generally at a decent noise level, although you are located on a busy street near a hospital. Food here was okay, the breakfast had some great varieties and Sicilian favorites. Good spread of meats, cheeses, fruits, fresh bread and juices. They tried making us eggs and American bacon as well which was lovely of them. Check in and out was very easy and efficient. The hotel is located 10 minutes from the main city center walking. There's also a grocery around 3 4 blocks away. There's a restaurant called 'Big Pizza' about a 30 second walk away that has awesome wood fire oven pizza owned by a local Italian family. Just be aware of 'riposo' where Italians rest and close shop for major hours in the afternoon. The walk back to the hotel is a bit taxing since it's all uphill but it's nothing too bad. Worst comes to worse it's a short taxi ride away from anywhere really in the city and public transport systems (bus and metro) are good in Catania.","21305":"The hotel is located a bit far from the center, it takes 20 minutes to walk to walk to Piazza Stecissoro where you can take the metro to the Central Train Station which is one station away.It is also close to Via Etnea, the main shopping street. I stayed in a single room which was spacious with a king size bed, a working desk, a long dressing mirror, 2 side lamps,2 chairs, 2 side lamps, one lamp is over the working desk,a baggage rack, an air conditioner,a landline phone, 7 electric sockets( one in the bathroom, 2 next to the bed, 2 sockets work constantly without the door key,one socket under the working desk), a wardrobe with drawers and hangers, a safety box, an extra quilt and an extra blanket in it, a minibar full of beverages and snacks, tea and coffee bags, kettle. The room also has a balcony overlooking the back of the hotel and the buildings.The lightning in the room is perfect,the ceiling lamp lightens all the room, the lamps are adjacent to the wall.The bathroom has body, hair and shampoo dispenser, a bathtub, toiletries, a bidet, a hairdryer.There is a sheer curtain and a roll up blind which operated by a button over the bed.The LCD TV has numerous Italian channels, along with English channels (CNN, DW English) The rooms are cleaned daily and the towels are changed everyday.The hotel has one elevator which is big enough for 2 people. There is a guest computer and a bar in the lobby.The receptionists are helpful and kind towards the guests. The breakfast costs 3 euros and it consists of cereals, coffee, cappucchino, espresso, fresh orange juice,tea bags, fresh fruit, pastries, bread and cheese types. It is served between 7-10 o'clock.The hotel is close to the bus station where the buses to the train station take off.There is a market (Simply) nearby the hotel on Via Androne, which is open between 8-10 o'clock (on Sundays it is open from 08.00 to 13.00). There are also restaurants and small markets on side streets.In short I can recommend this hotel for its facilities, its quiet location and its reasonably priced breakfast.","21309":"Booked into the BW Mediterraneo for 4 nights B&B. Very friendly and helpful English speaking staff. Rooms clean and modern. Hotel within easy walking distance of all central sites. Large Supermarket 150m away from hotel. Breakfast was good quality. Sky Sports channel on TV and free WiFi. Quiet area of city.","21313":"Staff were very welcoming and our room on the 5th floor was comfortable.  The bed was great - I am normally light sleeper in a new bed but I slept like a log the whole night.  The location is a bit outside the main attractions and the old town but that makes it quiet and therefore perfect for us. There is a kettle in the room. Towels were soft and shower strong. We would definitely stay here again!","21315":"The staff is very helpful and most speak fluent English. The breakfasts are great. The beds are comfortable. Everything is immaculate. Big fluffy towels. While the hours of restaurants in Catania seem unpredictable, you can always get a great salad or a sandwich or other snack at the bar for reasonable prices up to 11pm. After 5 days of late night and other snacking (with wine) are bill was only 118 euros.The concierge helped with transportation to a 2 hour tour in Taormina which was just the right amount of time to be away from Catania which has so much to offer in Roman ruins and museums. The desk was always helpful with cabs and information..","21319":"Hotel is centrally situated, however what made it special were the staff , they are very professional, friendly and ready to give you a helping hand! from the cleaning lady up to the front office desk managers! breakfast is something to dream about. besides the continental offer,they present you with the local produce ! genuine products! have to visit again !","21320":"This Best Western was just the ticket for a City Break base. A little more than a 10 minute walk to the main street in Catania. The staff were friendly and efficient with at least 1 English speaker on reception at all times. They were happy to advise on places to eat and drink as well as organizing airport transfer if required. Buffet breakfast was both hot and cold selection and always fresh. The only slight downside was the limited bar area but as a base it was great.","21323":"This hotel is terrible and no privacy. I had the \u201cdo not disturb\u201d hanging on my door, I went out to get something to eat, when I returned my electronic key didn\u2019t work so I went to the lobby to get my key refreshed... the customer service agent said \u201cmy colleague was in your room and noticed you may have been having trouble with the blind that darkens the room\u201d. I said, why was your colleague in my room since the do not disturb sign was on my door? The customer service guy said \u201cmy colleague knew you weren\u2019t there... I stated that I was not ok with that.","21327":"Had to stay there because of school and it's location made it an easy walk to most everything. The breakfast was vast and had a good variety for everyone. Very filling and made the easy a lot easier. The staff was very accommodating and made sure they addressed any issues. Very friendly and they all spoke excellent english.","21328":"The Best Western Hotel Mediterraneo didn't offer diner when we stayed there but we were reassured that there were an abundance of restaurants nearby and so went off for a wander to find a place to eat. One of my travelling companions owned a stud farm and so had a great affinity with horses. Needless to say he was mortified to find so many of the local diners serving horse flesh, so, we dined on Cheese that night! The hotel is nice though. Well placed in a central location for the historical center and a park. Entered a building that had three legs of man plaster work on the ceiling roses but neglected to note where that was other than it was on Via Etna. If you find it please remind me what it was.","21329":"Hotel is situated in the city centre, 10 mins walk from the Centro Storico of Catania and Via Etnea. Hotel is extremely clean, very good breakfast (it even included scrambled eggs and bacon) and staff are very pleasant and helpful. We celebrated our anniversary last Monday and hotel staff decorated the room with flowers, and provided us with champagne and fruit to top up our celebrations. This 4 star hotel is highly recommended.","21331":"Good breakfast, good bed, very clean room, all staff helpfull, and not far to the Centre , 12 minutes walk to open Market and to via Etnea. I tried other hotels in Catania, but this is one of the best hotel in Catania.","21338":"beautiful building and rooms bathroom gorgeous with large powerful shower, central location easy to walk to main hub of city, staff very friendly and welcoming went out of their way for us, fresh breakfast. Highly recommend.","21339":"Beautiful old building with modern stylish interior. The owner was so lovely and provided a wonderful breakfast. Certainly value for money and much nicer than the \u2018luxury\u2019 hotel we stayed in on Taormina.","21340":"We stayed here for 4 nights and really can't fault it. Situated in via Umberto with easy access to the station and the main town it is within a former palace which has been turned into accommodation.The owner was very welcoming and helpful and took our bags up in the lift.Our room was a very good sized double with a small balcony overlooking the local square which had a few cafes and a car park. Beautiful high ceilings and very light and airy, we had a good bathroom with shower although I would have liked a light over the mirror and there was a separate room for the toilet and bidet but no sink in here. Good space for clothes, there was a safe and a fridge which got REALLY cold, excellent air conditioning and free bottled water. Breakfast was ok, typical Italian with bread and pastries but not buffet style as it was served by the host. No tea coffee in room but we were invited to help ourselves from the kitchen as and when. Overall we had a good stay and would definitely recommend this as a good B &B.","21351":"We spent 3 great nights in this place. Location is perfect walking distance to nice restaurants and also sights. Honestly for us the place was more like a well rated hotel than b&b. The room nice and clean, bathroom good size and very stylish. The owner is very nice, helpful. we arrived late but he waited for us at midnight explaining everything. Breakfast is included which is also great. Every day rooms are cleaned and clean towels. We were very lucky to stay at this accommodation. Highly recommend!","21354":"Stayed at this B&B with my family, including my 80 year old mother, and cannot emphasis what a great experience it was. The B&B is clean, rooms are spacious with nicely done bathrooms and the balconies add to the elegant and sophisticated ambience. Luciano ensures that attention is given to every detail which result in excellent service. Breakfast is ample with fresh bread and croissants just out of the bakery's oven. Highly recommend.!!!","21355":"Absolutely beautiful guest house in a great location. The rooms were gorgeous and incredibly comfortable and the breakfast was delicious. It's right in the middle of the city so it was really easy for me to walk to the sites I wanted to visit. The owner, Luciano, went above and beyond with his service and even went so far as to walk me to the bus stop I needed for my bus to the airport! It's one of the best places I've stayed in, I couldn't recommend it highly enough.","21357":"Got a really good welcome here. Both host and hostess were extremely helpful and gave us some great advice for our Saturday night in Catania.You are just a short stroll from a real hive of activity with a great choice of restaurants. Great night's sleep and lovely light breakfast. Great experience and would highly recommend this spotlessly clean ,well managed B and B","21358":"This is a gem of a B&B, run by the ever-helpful Luciano. Recently renovated, the room was great combining original features with a modern bathroom. Spotlessly clean and everything you would need. The rooms face on to a square and the hotel is on a main road so there is some noise despite the double glazing and shutters. Apart from that this is a great place to stay, the staff providing faultless service. It's also a stone's throw from the best bar in Catania - Mosaik.","21361":"We only stayed for one night but it was great, the location is really nice and perfect to walk around at night. The owner was nice and recommend a lot of great restaurants and bars around. The room was clean, designed really nice and modern and we loved it! The only thing is that we slept in a room that the balcony was facing the main Street Umberto corso. So we had a lot of noises, I recommend this place only ask for a non facing out room. The breakfast we got was amazing, Catania is well known for their pistachio food and we had the greatest pistachio pastries in the morning.","21394":"The staff are friendly, and the location is very central, but that's all I liked about this place. The bathrooms are old and not very clean. The mixed dorm was noisy, the beds are noisy and very basic, there was no convenient way for me to charge my phone with access from my bed, and the reception opposite was noisy until 4.30am which is when I checked out. Also a cheeky 5 euro deposit for a bit of plastic key card is shady. Will not go back.","21395":"The location of this hostel is amazing! Not only is smacked in the city center, it's an old building with fresco ceilings! Professional and friendly staff, great breakfast, enough space in the dorms, lockers and individual lights. Dorms are spotless clean. The A C however was on some nights turned on or down to such extent that would have made a polar bear very happy and apparently it was not possible to increase the temperature (or the night staff did not know how to do it, I'm not sure)  Toilets and showers are cleaned regularly, but at times it appears to be insufficient for the number of guests using them (or they should at least be checked more often). The rooftop is amazing, it's only a pity for the guests of the hostel that late afternoon it becomes a regular bar with regular, actually slightly overpriced prices.","21397":"This hotel is exactly what you are looking for. Let me explain it. Catania is a great city and to ensure the maximum from your stay, book at Ostello degli Elefanti. It is in the heart of Catania, next to the major city Square and the well known via Etnea, good to relax, go shopping of just enjoy it with a walk. The main city attractions are there all around. Besides it has an amazing outlook from the top roof. Fish market and open street market to buy somethings too. It is just 2 minutes crossing the square. Lovely. Great service. Guys on top of things. Interesting breakfast and a well equipped kitchen to cook too.","21398":"We didnt stay in the hostel, but we visited the rooftop bar and had a great evening there. The view on Etna is absolutely amazing. This evening definitely marked our visit to Catania. Next time we will try to find free room in the hostel which looks amazing, like no other we visited before.","21403":"Booked for2 nights, stayed for 3. Fantastic location next to piazza duomo, easy day access to Syracuse and bus to Etna. Very helpful, friendly staff ( a special thanks to Marcelo for all the advice  assistance). Nice large dorm with a c, strong wifi, wonderful simple breakfast with all you need to start the day. Charming city with summer nightlife just out the door - restaurants, gellateria, supermarkets - rooftop bar with direct views to Etna in the distance - very enjoyable stay and deserving a 5 star rating for a hostel.","21421":"Great location in the most interesting and safe part of town. Very comfortable. Huge space and architecturally intriguing. (Lots of details in the ceilings) breakfast is good for a hostel. Roof top bar with great view on mount Etna which is accessible all the time to hostel residents. Staff very friendly. Good vibe in general","21423":"It's very central, right in the main square of Catania, with restaurants just downstairs. Breakfast was pretty decent, beds, showers and toilets were small but adequate, reception staff were pretty helpful with any questions I had and it was very handy to have 24 hour reception. They even called a taxi for me at 5am. The rooftop had some nice views in the evening of the surrounding buildings all lit up, and I was able to see Mount Etna in the early morning. Although they didn't allow guests to bring their own drinks to the rooftop while the bar itself was open.  There was a fair bit of street noise from busking guitar singers players from my dorm until 1am most nights, so some earplugs might be a good idea. I had a slight miscommunication with one staff member over washing my clothes though. I hung my wet clothes in my room where there was plenty of space, but my clothes were moved to the rooftop, and as I was going out for the day and didn't realise the staff member wanted my still wet clothes moved away by the afternoon, he seemed a bit annoyed when I returned later. I apologised as I didn't realise, but it's best to make sure staff are okay with leaving clothes somewhere to dry.","21425":"I\u2019ll start by saying that the staff are superb, friendly. Always there to offer advice on things to do or if you have any queries.  The maintenance of the building was poor, the females bathroom down the end - one of the toilet seats was missing, the bathroom could have definitely done with a decent clean, the showers offer no privacy with two being side by side with a shower curtain and a see through mesh curtain being the only thing separating you from the toilet area, the handle to the bathroom get as though it was going to fall off at any moment. The beds were covered by very flimsy curtains, and very rough scratchy blankets.  The room we were in was the closest to the reception and you could hear the reception buzzer going off all hours of the night and people talking in the reception area.  The website says they offer laundry, we were not allowed to do this till 11pm and it could be hung in our room or the roof on a clothes horse provided. We put it in our room and another person removed all our wet clothes and hung theirs up the next morning.  There is free breakfast of yoghurt, some fruit, stale breads and cereal.  The location is excellent, right in the centre they do have a bar upstairs which has a great view of the square and mt Etnea.  Again the staff were extremely nice and helpful but the hostel itself is very run down.","21431":"Last month me and my friend spend 5 nights at this hostel. And it was very nice. We meet nice people from all over the word, and we became all friends. The place has the best location ever, and its clean enough.","21450":"The location is very good - to reach from the airport, close to the bus station and fish and fresh tasty fruits and vegetables. The staff was so nice, friendly and ready to help you with your requests. Not to mention the nice balconies that you can sit, read or just watch the people. And the rooftop bar with the view to mount etna...amazing :)","21451":"I stayed 1 night to see Mount Etna. The staff are really nice and very helpful.  BREAKFAST It was better than other hostels by just a little bit. They offer a variety of fruits (peach, apple, etc) and small yogurt. That's all I ate. They have cereal, bread, milk, and other things.  SHARED BATHROOM - The female bathroom down the hall looks a little worn down and could use some renovation. It also lacks ventilation. - After one showers, there is no where fast way for the hot air to pass through other than opening the entry door. - The curtains were cheap and do not provide full coverage. - There wasn't side chairs or enough wall hooks to put away your items.  ROOM - I stayed in the 8-bed female dorm. Quite Spacious. - I like that each bunk bed comes with a 2-port USB outlet and curtain. - The beds are covered with a black plastic film. I was lucky enough to have an unoccupied single bed in the room, so I slept on that, instead of the bunk bed. (I think I was less restless than any other hostel bed I slept on within Italy) - This room has 2 balconies so you will hear noise from the busy square. - The lockers come with a keyed lock. And there are 2 shelves. - It was difficult to find a wall outlet. Not sure how many there are in the room.  The roof terrace offers good views. There is a bar there. You can see part of Mount Etna. It's the highlight of the hostel.  I wasn't sure if there is an elevator but you have to walk 2 or 3 levels of stairs.  It's a 15-minute walk from the Catania Centrale Train station.  There is a kitchen with a fridge, so I'm sure you can cook.","21501":"As our flight would be arriving late in Catania and we had to pick up a rental car upon arrival we booked a room at this B&B (Via San Giuseppe Alla Rena 124). Our company consisted of three male childhood friends on a road trip in Sicily and, just for one night, we didn\u2019t mind sharing a room with two double beds and a single bed and an adjoining bathroom. The room was cheap (70 euros for three) and clean. It was quiet once the air traffic stopped (around eleven p.m.). Contrary to what its name suggests, the bed and breakfast doesn\u2019t serve breakfast, but we found a nice little shop selling coffee and croissants (Panificio Buccheri) and there is also a large bar nearby (Bar Parisi). For a late dinner we recommend the excellent Pizzeria Panineria The Simpson a bit further on the street (N. 109).  From the B&B it takes you about 15 minutes to walk to the airport but Via San Giuseppe La Rena is a busy and not very pleasant street, especially in the dark. The B&B offers transfer to and from the airport for 10 euros (one way), which is said to be much cheaper than a taxi.  We had some difficulties finding the B&B, even with the GPS of our rental car and called the friendly landlady for directions. The entrance is located opposite a shop (Mini Mercato at N. 139) and you have to enter a small alley next to a garage.","21515":"A colleague o'mine introduced me to this b&b mostly for logistic reasons since it's located in the real heart of Catania. We are talking about an ancien apartment re-adapted for hosting guests. Very particular, very enjoyable and with a staff extremely kind","21518":"I stayed here 4 nights, host Tecla given me the warmest hospitality I ever have, she given me handy info. Room is spacious, clean and cozy, love there're 2 balconies to let more sunlight into the room! Breakfast is incl. but since need to go to another location so I never use this service. Location is perfect, pretty close to Piazza Duomo, and just 3 minutes walk to restaurant street via santa filomena! Will definitely stay again when revisit Catania!","21580":"Wanted to like this place. Good price and communication.One minute walk to fish market, four to main square. Coupons for breakfast in main square but the pastries coffee they have there are outstanding. Wifi fiddly but managed to work (slow, so can't stream) in the end. Good provisions for young children and nice selection of tea, coffee, cold water, and fridge.  Big problem: cleanliness of bedding and infestation. Duvet provided without cover.. so how is this washed between guests? And woke up first night with over thirty bites and swelling around the eyes from bedbugs so had to get antihistamine at the pharmacy in the main square. More bites the following nights.  Secondary problem, bathroom smells of sewage but expect that for old buildings in Italy and wasn't too bad. Shower nice and hot.","21583":"Location is in the centre of the old city. The place is a bit worn off and needs a refurbishing. Furniture is a bit to old and not comfortable. Also some floor tiles needs to be fixed. But overall not bad.","21585":"My room was #9 and I loved it!! I\u2019m only 5\u20190 and it had very low roof being an attic room. Tall people beware. Great, sunny, clean bathroom w  tub. Clean, quirky room, comfy bed, and pillows. Fast internet to watch Netflix! Great location!","21586":"We had a warm welcome here and the artistic decorations are interesting. The room is large with a couch. The air conditioner is very efficient. The beds however were very small (not comfortable if you're 6'3) and the bedding wasn't big enough for the single beds. The bathroom was very small and you had to squeeze past the toilet and bidet to reach the shower. There was a good sized shelf in there though and the water was hot. While we appreciated the attention to detail I'd rather bigger beds with full sized linen and a larger bathroom. A bit too rustic for my liking...","21588":"So nice and relaxed, dear wasn't manned a lot but we like that style of not being looked over, loved it although we got bitten by mosquitos in the room until we said and got a aid to plug in and floor could of been cleaned during our stay, we couldn't get signal on TV but WiFi was very fast. we definitely would stay again and it's an ideal location, thank you for having us :blush:","21591":"Great location close to centre of town and fish market. Alessandro was very friendly and helpful. Basic room for three people with clean bathroom and hot water. Would stay again due to location. Breakfast at nearby patisserie overlooking square.","21599":"I rented the apartment and I was very satisfied, very clean, kitchen with everything you need, beaufiful terrace looking at Etna, very good location, 10 minutes walk to the train and bus station, You are in the center of Catania so it is noisy, if you are sensitive to noise, bring ear plugs. .","21606":"One of the best Bed and Breakfast I never Seen... Very Clean, friendly and comfortable place in Sicily. Close to the center and surrounded by the topical architectural building and by fish market.  Design first!","21610":"Nice little room which is well maintained. Good sized bathroom coming with it. Very clean as well. We had no hot water one day, but the host took immediate action and fixed the issue in minutes. The host is very friendly.","21613":"We enjoyed our stay at the Bad, the proprietor Alessandro was charming and helpful. The accommodation was clean,fun and quirky though a little tired and could do with a freshen up. There were a few minor negative points- hence the 4 star rating-like the shower leaking slightly and the bathroom light doesn't work despite pointing this out to Alessandro. The Bad is situated a few minutes walk from the centre, the area around looks rough but we never felt intimidated or threatened,even walking around with an expensive camera at night. Catania is a photographer's dream, get booked up!","21614":"Great place to stay in Catania - very close to the historic centre (less than five minutes walk from the Piazza), good value, quirky and friendly. The kitchen in the mini apartment was very well equipped - you could easily fully self cater if you wanted to with things like oil usefully provided for you. The private roof terrace is absolutely brilliant - gets the sun practically all day, view of Etna, a great place to chill out. I\u2019d definitely stay again.","21615":"We stayed two nights with two kids (4 and 7 years) at B&B Bad Catania and we also booked the Etna Tour over B&B Bad Catania. The B&B is located super central just 100 meters behind Catania\u2019s famous fish market and very near to the wonderful Piazza Duomo. The room was big, quiet, clean and decorated with very interesting art (pls. see pictures). Just perfect for a small family. For breakfast you get coupons for the cafe \u201ePrestipin\u201c at Piazza Duomo 9 (a very nice place for breakfast and also for an ap\u00e9ro). The trip to Etna was really good thanks to Andrea who is the best guide around the whole volcano (Alessandro, pls. tell this to him). The visit was with a small group of 7 peoples (held in English and in Italian) and included a wonderful walk through the beautiful nature and some interesting stops at special places, including an excursion into a lava tunnel and a lunch. Last but not least we have to mention that Alessandro organized everything very fast and very good and thanks to him our stay was just perfect!","21617":"Great communication with owner Alessandro. He was friendly and gave us great recommendations for local vegetarian restaurants (every one was brilliant! See my reviews), and also booked us a tour to see the mosaics at Villa Romana del Casale. The room was clean and spacious. Location is wonderful, just a few steps from the fish market and main cathedral square. As you are in the heart of it all, best to wear ear plugs if you are a light sleeper! Would definitely recommend. There are nice common areas indoors and out on the rooftop terrace, with complimentary tea and coffee, as well as an \u201chonour box\u201d\u2019for cold soft drinks and beer.","21622":"We have just returned from 4 nights at the BAD b&b. There can\u2019t be a better located place to stay in Catania. It is just steps from the Fish market and Piazza Duomo. Each morning we sat in the piazza which is where the bar where you go to eat breakfast (a pastry and a drink) is. The square is busy all day with tourists and locals. Plenty of excellent people watching. BAD itself was perfect for us. Clean, quirky and with very efficient air conditioning. Alessandro was very helpful, sorted out our trip to Etna as well as our airport transfers. We would definitely go back and I have no worries about recommending BAD.","21627":"Great location nearly steps from the fish market and old town. Quiet, comfortable, superior rooftop lounge! Owner arranged an airport pickup which was super helpful and provided information and a map to the local sights.","21636":"Very clean apartment and they were very helpful. Whenever I go back to Catania I would stay here again. They will help you find your way. Busses, tours and nice places. They know it and show how to get there.","21664":"Overall we were pleased with the B&B as it was in a very central location and it was easy to get everywhere - it made a good base for seeing the city and for day trips. The proprietor was friendly. Breakfast wasn't amazing, just a little pastry. It was advertised as a private bathroom but was actually shared, and a bit dingy. This was a bit irritating as I had booked this place specifically because it said private bathroom, but actually having to share the bathroom was fine. The room itself was huge and very comfortable once we had finally figured out how to work the air con! It had a fridge which was really helpful.","21685":"The only good thing about it is the location, via Etnea and, probably, the price. Old, badly maintained, broken shower enclosure. The one sidelight, in the shape of a woman's high heel boot!?!, wasn't working because unplugged. Unfortunately there was no socket to plug it in! Luca, the owner, wanted to be paid in advance (house rules, he said). We had booked for two nights and we paid for the first night. When, the morning after, I had a cold shower, we decided to leave and find some other place to stay. We were offered a cappuccino and croissant as breakfast and after that we left with Luca or his mother nowhere to be seen. 40 \u20ac isn't much but with a few more you can get so much more.","21700":"Casa D'aria is a real find. i brought a group of 14 to Sicily, and Catania was our first stop for 3 nights. Casa D'aria could not have been more perfect. Instead of each guest having a room we each had our own apartment complete with a full kitchen. Beautifully designed, appointed and comfortable apartments. It could not have been a better introduction to Catania and Sicily.  Patrizia was amazing. Helpful, patient and informative, She even steered me to the best seafood restaurant in Catania and helped considerably with all the pesky details. She also made all of my guests feel welcome and at home.  Casa D'aria is also within short walking distance to anyplace in Catania you would want to be. 15 minutes tops to the train station, Piazza Duomo, Castello Orsino or the great shopping on Via Aetna.  All in all, for hospitality, beauty, comfort (the beds were amazing) and convenience, Casa D'aria will now always be my first stop in Sicily.","21710":"I spent five days in Casa D'Aria this September and couldn't have had a more amazing and authentic experience!  The apartment was spacious, I chose one with a terrace and a washer dryer so it really felt like I was living in the area during my stay. The kitchen was well stocked with supplies and with great markets nearby I got to enjoy home-cooked meals too.  I was lucky to meet Daria the owner- who takes pleasure in hosting her guests in a truly authentic way. The historic and centralized neighborhood is artsy and fun, along with being 5 minutes from the Piazza Duomo. There were plenty of amazing trattorias, bars, and things nearby that she recommended. She also made herself available by phone in case I needed anything or had questions. It is this level of service, along with the amazing apartment and location, that will make me definitely come back!  **I will note that these are short-stay apartment rentals and everything is listed on the website for you to know about what to expect from the property-- I was surprised to see negative reviews that complain about lack of daily cleanings, an empty reception, or too many stairs. C'mon people, you're renting your own apartment not staying in a hotel!! It's really sad how nowadays people attack small business owners for things they don't even bother to read themselves!!!","21712":"On 4th floor walk up. This is an apartment and does not have a full time front desk, no daily room cleaning. Extra charge for late checkin. Plywood in shower, shower does not drain, hot water heater leaking, gas leak smell too. First three floors are apartments for new immigrants to Italy. Stairwell to loft bedroom is steep and you better be physically fit. Good location. Info they did give us was wrong but funny. Told us no bus to airport. Bus stop only a few blocks away. They told us No ice in Sicily. Crazy but funny.","21713":"Central location which is great! I had a room with a nice terrace but unfortunately my room was dirty, with someone's food left in the oven, pretty horrid. The manager (from the US) was very nice about it and I'm sure the owner will improve the cleaning staff, but I checked out early. I'd normally give a scathing review for dirty rooms but the communications with staff, location and facilities were good.","21747":"The place is centrally located. Short walking distance to the city center, the fish market and the bus terminal. There are several good places to eat nearby. The B&B has nice staff. The breakfast is decent and the cleaning is good. Admittedly, there is a train line that passes the building, but the noise is minimal. The only minus must be that there is no elevator in the house, so you have to carry your luggage one floor up yourself.","21755":"When you arrive at Duca di Uzeda on a hot and busy Saturday morning and your first glimpse of the hotel is the rather tired front of the building and the smell from the fishmarket nearby, you think OMG. But as soon as you get inside to the reception on the first floor things are completely different. Everything is neat and tidy and the staff is very helpful and friendly. The rooms are clean and nice - and the hotel is really good value for the money. We found it very charming to be right in the middle of a authentic city full of the daily life of the Sicilians. If we once again want to travel to Sicily and Catania, Duca di Uzeda will definitively be our choise again. Susanne and Henrik","21757":"I had a one night here. So tricky to find and parking almost impossible. Yes it\u2019s by the fish market! My room backed onto a railway line. Constant noisy trains all day and night. Interior is ok. Quite clean. Breakfast minimal with cold tea coffee. They\u2019ve tried but.... for me ... it didn\u2019t work . Would not return or recommend.","21758":"After difficulty parking, first impressions were not good We were pleasantly surprised once we were inside We were given a warm welcome and shown to our room which was delightful All the rooms are individually furnished but unfortunately back on to a railway track The location is near the fish market and there are plenty of restaurants nearby The couple who run the rooms are very friendly and provide an adequate breakfast Croissant, toast , yogurt and coffee This is a well priced hotel \u20ac65 and good value for its location","21829":"It looks beautiful and yes, sure, I would like to stay there, but .... You book it in advance, pay in advance, but one day before you arrive they just cancel your booking. We were on the travel already receiving this message, not nice! So it turned out it was a very busy weekend, nearly everything is fully booked, was very hard to find another place, just because they decided to make more profit and rent out the room for more money they canceled the older bookings - not nice! So be careful, because they don't care at all!","21831":"Smack in the centre, just a couple of minutes walking to most places (for as far you want to visit anything in Catania except for restaurants in the first place...)  Very helpful host Luca, did provide us with lots of information. Rooms where modernly decorated, very spacious in an old building. Absolute bliss!  Breakfast was proper, place was tidy and Clean. Parking in the area is easy and inexpensive. So was the apartment actually, great value for money!","21847":"The staff at this place couldn\u2019t be friendlier and more helpful. The room was spacious and clean. It is central to everything. I strongly recommend it. I didn\u2019t have any issue with noise and i was there on Saturday and Friday nights","21854":"Stayed one night here and were pleasantly surprised. Constantino was very warm and welcoming and friendly. The room was larger than expected. The location was great too (ie 10 min walk to the cathedral and next to the theatre). Breakfast was lovely too. Great value for money and it helped that he spoke good English as we got tips on car parking and tourist information.","21856":"Average. Not specially clean. Arrived and the room was't ready. The staff was very friendly and nice. Don't go on Saturday night, it's impossible to sleep if you are in the room with the view on the street, as the noise of the traffic and honking and shouting and music makes it impossible.","21857":"We spent four nights at the B&B Opera. Very nice hospitality and friendly. I wish to thank the host Costantino and Jane as she was super helpful. Also the location is only short walking distance from the bus and train station.","21858":"Our family of four enjoyed 4super nights here, excellent location within walking distance of bus and train stations but also easy access to the sights, great restaurant areas and safe comings and goings. Air conditioned rooms which were a lovely mix of old and new, great showers, comfy beds. Breakfast delicious!!","21861":"The host Costantino with his colleague and friend Claire are very friendly, caring and helpful. Accommodation, service and cleanliness are topp! The accommodation is very central and ideal to discover Catania and its surroundings. Very recommended!","21866":"As soon as we arrived, we were welcomed by the host. He gave us some drinks and a map on which he marked a lot of the sights to see in Catania.  During our stay, the hostess helped us with a lot of things. For example, she booked a tour for us to mount Etna and arranged a taxi to the airport on the day of departure.  We had also booked breakfast, which was very good and very affordable. However, our bed was a little stiff, but that's not too bad for a few nights.  The B&B was located very closely to the historical center of Catania. Everything was easy to reach by foot.","21873":"We spent a single night in this accommodation. It was comfortable and we got a warm welcome. However it is upstairs so bringing bags up is a challenge. It is well located being just a short walk from the city centre. There is a small lively restaurant very close by, around the Opera House.","21914":"We very much enjoyed our 2 nights stay at this wonderful B&B , located really in the heart of Catania. The room was comfortable and perfectly clean and the breakfast delicious. There was a parking place (booked in advance).","21924":"What a wonderful little place this is. Based on third floor of an old building. The staff are super friendly and more than willing to help and make your stay memorable. I had a suite room which was marvellous. Lovingly decorated with high ceiling. Great bed with a lovely arched window leading to a small balcony. Nice bedding and a nice sofa. Very good cabin style bathroom with double sink and rain forest shower. Breakfast as variety and more than adequate. You are told to treat ad your home and you can. I would not hesitate in staying here again if I visited Catania. For price as well you can't beat this great place.","21928":"We have been to B&B Nel Cuore in July 2018. I'm sure that I have never met people in a hotel b&b that ara so kind, warm, friendly and helpful !!. The B&B is located just next to the mainstreet of Catania. Everything is on walking distance and Catania is a wonderful town in Sicilia that you should visit. The B&B has 4 or 5 rooms. Clean and nicely decorated. If we're every back in Sicilia I'm sure I'll be back here. !!","21929":"Everything about this b&b was excellent. We had a lovely room with a very nice outlook over the rooftops to the sea. The location was excellent with just one block away from the Main Street so was quiet. Allessandro and Anna couldn\u2019t have been more helpful. Terrific value and excellent throughout","21932":"We stayed for one night as a pit stop between Palermo and Taormina and were very pleased with the stay. Although the hostess did not speak English, she was very welcoming and gave us advice on places to visit in the city after check in.  The room was bright and large and had a lovely view of the city. The breakfast was very nice with delicious pastries as well as everything else you would expect. What really made this place stand out were the little extras- free bottles of water whenever we wanted, a plug-in to ward off mosquitoes, a large walk in rainforest shower. All of these things made the stay feel like excellent value for money. Highly recommended.","21945":"I don\u2019t want to finish 2017 without mentioning the wonderful experience I had staying this summer at B and B Nel Cuore di Catania. I highly recommend this location to anyone wanting to explore East Sicily. We stayed at B and B Nel Cuore di Catania in \u201c Orange Room\u201d for 6 wonderful days Ana and Alessandro and Adele were wonderful hosts-warm and welcoming and always happy to assist us with any issues. This B and B is very safe ! They organized us the trip to Etna with Toni a \u201cmolto simpatico\u201d guide. The building is heritage listed but all rooms (very clean) have modern conveniences. It has even an elevator that is very useful. This B and B is just in the center of Catania so no need of transport unless going out of city. If you are looking for warm and friendly stay with great breakfast, this is the perfect stay! You will be not disappointed. Thank you Ana and Alessandro! Adina and Angela from Bucharest","21947":"Anna and Allesandro were extremely helpful and anxious to please. The rooms are simple and nice, and most importantly are quiet. Beds are good. Excellent location on a quiet street that is centrally located.","21948":"We spent a total of six nights here, one on the way to Enna and five on the return from Palermo. It was an excellent choice. Located on the third floor(not counting the ground floor) it comes equipped with a tiny elevator so no worries about heavy suitcases. It's located in an old, historic area of Catania within walking distance of many of Catania's attractions. The owners couldn't do enough to make you feel welcome. Our room had high ceilings and a balcony. The view was stunning and the sunrise something to get up for. The bathroom was thoroughly modern with twin sinks and a generous shower. Clean facilities, generous towels, good quality sheets. The breakfasts offered fresh croissants, beautiful breads, hard boiled eggs, meat, cheese, fruit .... Would I recommend staying here while exploring Catania? Definitely!","21950":"The man who runs this place is the nicest man on earth. I said I would arrive around 6:30pm and he was outside when I got there to help me park my car. Also the room was very nice and good restaurant options nearby.  The area may look a little dicey when driving in, but it's a city, so don't be turned off. Buatta, restaurant down the street is very good!","21951":"Lovely b and b in the heart of old city. Very clean, good quality sheets and towels. Good choice at breakfast. The family and staff were incredibly helpful. Cannot recommend highly enough. The host even came out to meet the taxi after late plane arrival.","21952":"We only had one night here, but our hosts were delightful. Nice room, centrally located and very nice breakfast. We would recommend this place when visiting Catania. Our host was helpful in suggesting places to eat and things to see. Because we were celebrating an anniversary there was a small bottle of Proscecco in the room with wine glasses, a nice touch and very much appreciated.","22006":"Very disappointing. There was no running water therefore couldn\u2019t wash, cook or flush toilet.  Mattress has completely sunk and gave me a back ache  TV doesn\u2019t work  This self catering did not offer any pantry basics like a little bit of olive oil and salt :(  Checked out after 1 night and went somewhere else.","22008":"Flat was comfortable, clean, well equipped, easy to access and handy for all amenities. Reception staff at Habitat B and B (separate location) were very helpful and looked after our luggage. The 900m walk from Habitat B and B to Habitat Home required a taxi ride as we had luggage. The taxi ride cost 15 Euros. If you could walk, it is still a confusing route through windy back streets of Catania.","22012":"If you're looking for the nicest, cleanest and most comfortable place to stay in Sabang, Puerto Galera that is fairly priced, then I would definitely recommend Habitat Home. Cozy bed, definitely cool AC, hot shower, clean toilet (this is a must!) and a good view, are just some of the few things you'll get in return for your money. Oh, not to mention the most accommodating people at Sea Rider Dive Center.","22060":"The room isn\u2019t so bad if it would be for money that I reserved. I paid 36euro instead 23euro. No notice before. After call with some man - total arrogant - that I didn\u2019t pay them. I will try to solve it with booking.","22106":"Whilst in Sicily we stayed in this hotel for 3 nights. It\u2019s in a great location for buses from the airport, local to restaurants and shops and central to Catania. The rooms are fantastic...very modern !! The excellent rooms were complimented by kind professional staff. Would recommend this hotel to others.","22107":"Had a lovely short stay here. If I\u2019m in Catania again I will definitely stay here again.  The room and bathroom were clean and fresh. Breakfast was lovely.  The staff were excellent.  I checked in close to midnight and when I called to get help to find the place I think I woke someone up, but they were more than obliging and happy to help.  10 10 all round - service, room, breakfast etc","22112":"It would be a mistake to be deterred by the old grey wooden doors and the aged stairs. PERSEVERE!! A warm friendly welcome awaits you in the modern interior. This hotel manages to combine old and new with style. Breakfast was continental but staff happy to serve bacon and eggs. The room was spacious, modern and spotlessly clean. Staff extremely helpful, competent and efficient. Small hotel all on one floor. Due to stairs and small lift this hotel not really suitable the infirm.","22117":"We knew this small hotel was inside one of the old palazzos in Via Etnea and found it immediately. Its not rare in Catania to find a quite dilapidated entrance leading to something pleasant so I was not put out on finding a grand old door which had seen many better days and a desolate kind of courtyard. A door to your right leads to a tiny lift and a dusty staircase. (The lift is slow and tiny but the only downside to this place). Once upstairs the place is bright, modern, clean, and good value indeed for money. Our room had carved ceiling, air conditioning, three very comfortable beds, private shower, flat screen tv and frigo bar, plus balcony overlooking Giardini Bellini. The staff is pleasant and friendly .... A good breakfast is included in the price and staff let us leave our luggage at reception until called for after check out.","22128":"Loved this elegant hotel! Convenient, central location, comfortable, spacious rooms, seemingly unlimited hot water, excellent WiFi, delicious breakfast and the most welcoming, helpful staff! A special thank you to Elisabetta!","22131":"This hotel is under RESTRUCTURATION and hence NO ELEVATOR is available. For a 4th floor hotel and staying with my parents WAS REALLY PAINFUL AND DISGUSTING EXPERIENCE. I will always remember it as very unpleasant from the staff not to inform their clients beforehand! This is a VERY MORAL ISSUE and should be taken into consideration. Besides that, the hotel inside looks very fancy and it is actually comfy.","22146":"The staff were so friendly and helpful. Room immaculate and bed really comfortable probably one of the most comfortable in our 5 weeks away in Europe. The location is perfect so close to the main shopping and eating Street if Via Etna. So hard to decide on a place when you don\u2019t know the area so well but this location is great. Really quiet too and a big bathroom which was rare also in the B&Bs we have stayed in. Lovely breakfast so would highly recommend if staying in Catania.","22147":"We we're three days at this very comfortable and cozy place. The lady that manages the apartments is really kinder and everything you need is there for you. The room was very spacious, clean, all details taken care. We had a pr\u00edvate terrace were we enjoyed chating at night . Breakfast is included and everything offered is cooked by her, cakes and breads, also fruit and cereals.It was fantastic, location is on the old part of the city, walking distance to main attractions and safe yo walk even if the first impression is that the \u00e1rea may be dark. Parking for the car is important, is around the corner.We strongly recommend this place !!!!!!","22150":"When I arrived at Dimoramuri, I really had a warm welcome. Staff is so friendly. Rooms are cosy and super clean, which is very important to me. Breakfast is good esspecialy the homemade cake! Location is excellent. It feels a bit like coming home. I would recommend this bed & breakfast definitly!","22155":"You will enjoy to stay in this BB, the location is great and safe. The hosting family is friendly, they live at the property as well. Homemade cakes for breakfast you can find as well. Room cleaned each day. AC in the room is amazing.","22221":"Take a trip back in time with the 1920s elevator up to the B&B where you will be met with a great smile and a spectacular ceiling... and a gentleman who will actually carry your luggage to your room for you... then have a seat in the great communal lounge area on a plush sofa while having a cup of coffee and browsing through magazines (if you can keep your eyes off the exquisitely painted ceiling with cherubs and clouds).","22267":"we booked  this  b&b as we had an early flight home from Catania the next day. The b&b is located in a old residential building. Our room was very small but nice and clean. The staff was very nice, very helpful and partly English speaking.   Negative to say about the b&b is defenitly its location. Catania is not a very Pritty or interesting city and the area around the b&b is dodgy.  However it is central and 15 min to the airport.  Further the shower was not really working cold water and low pressure. Also, b&b is a bit misleading, since breakfast is served in a near caffe. (you get a voucher)","22378":"Where do I start with this review of b&b massimo centro! We were booked to stay here for 3 nights in August 2015 through booking.com, we arrived one hot afternoon around 2pm after lots of travelling, we rang the buzzer and the gate opened and we went in with our luggage to be greeted at the bottom of the stairs by the most rude man Iv ever met! My friend did most the talking as she is fluent in Italian, he appeared to be the owner of the hotel, he said the room wasn't ready yet and we had to come back at 6pm! We were in disbelief as the check in time is 2pm and we're both looking forward to a cold shower after our travelling, when my friend said this to him he said very rudely I don't care where you have travelled from the room isn't ready until 6pm go and have a coffee or something we were actually in shock the way he was speaking to us, he stood on the stairs looking down on us at the bottom of the stairs trying to be intimidating. After much arguing we said we were not paying for a hotel room that we couldnt get in until the night when clearly check in is 2pm, we then left and walked the streets in the heat with all our luggage looking for a hotel, (we later found one and it was very nice indeed) my friend and I were shouted at by the owner, not a very nice experience for two young girls travelling on their own, I would recommend everyone to stay away from this hotel yes it's cheap but it's cheap for a reason! .....and to add insult to Injury he had the cheek to tell booking.com that we didn't show up to the hotel! What a horrible man! Avoid at all costs people!","22437":"This is a very central bed and breakfast hotel with lovely IKEA furniture. Breakfast is great and the views are fantastic my husband and I could not complain. At first when u arrive you do think what are you walking into but once inside it\u2019s is very comfortable. Surrounding area not great but the town Mayor we are told is trying to do something about this.....don\u2019t hold your breath. Room is clean and so is bathroom. Balcony had a view of mount Aetna which was amazing. Town center not far to walk and very cheap. If I could say a negative would be the pillows felt they were dated with fiber inside coming apart...these should be replaced really. Would stay here again as we had use of kitchen for snacks to store cold in fridge.","22440":"B & B Turiddu is a centrally located accommodation with great staff - Valeria - and very clean comfortable accommodation and good simple Continental breakfast We stayed one night - we took local Alibus ( very cheap 4 Euros) from Catania airport to the B& B but got lost when getting off at the correct stop Valeria was helpful in finding us . She also was very helpful in guiding us to take the local bus rather than train to Taormina- much cheaper and gave us a great view of the coastline and the towns we passed by Valeria spoke excellent English and very knowledgeable on the various sites in and around the area","22442":"+ Very comfortable bed, clean and modern room with wi-fi and air conditioning, amazing view from the balcony (Etna!), spacious bathroom, most helpful and nicest hostess ever. Close to stores and city center. I do recommend evening glass of vine on the balcony while watching Etna disappearing in the darkness.  - There's nothing wrong with the hotel (specially on the 6th floor), but building's surroundings aren't most welcoming and you can meet some refugees roaming around.","22454":"Went here in November for a short break. The pension style property is very near a metro Giuffrida which services the main train bus station and market area. The market area is just amazing for all meat fish veg but surprisingly the really beautiful veg didn't really appear in the restaurants that we tried. The del Toscano has decent size rooms some of which have a separate bathroom rather than en suite. The breakfast room is small and the food average but acceptable with superb coffee @ fresh rolls. There is a bakery on most corners that sells bread ( unlike the UK ) I couldn't stop eating Vongole We enjoyed the weather ( 23% in November ) and made a train journey to Taormina and swam in the sea. Please note that if you want to go into the town of Taormina you must take the bus as it is perched on a hillside. The train will take you to the beach. we were told the trains were unreliable but our experience was fine. We also went by bus to Mount Etna which dominates the Island . We had a good time and had a nice lunch at the Refuge Hotel. There are various ways of accessing the volcano by cable car or tour guide and you can also go into the forest area by quadbike. All of this costs of course. We were just happy to visit We would recommend the Trattoria Sicilia via Etna which is a brisk 10 minute walk from the b & b. For meat lovers Eusebio across from the Trattoria is meant to be superb but we couldn't read anything on the menu - apologies for our awful Italian. The Colapesce is more expensive but great for fish","22479":"We stayed at this hotel for 3 night. Good location, walking distance to downtown Professional and welcoming on arrival, Rooms: Clean comfortable beds. The room was spacious with good shower and toilet. But the whole hotel needs to be refreshed to achieve 4 stars Breakfast: Good and many options, good service","22481":"Very nice hotel with helpful and nice staff, specially Lucia and Valeria who were very nice and simpathetic girls. Lucia helped us to book an Etna excursion over the phone once we do not speak italian, she was great! At first, the hotel seemed little bit old but once you get to the room and other spaces you understand that old style and feel very welcome and happy with the environment.  Pros: The hotel has a parking lot (it is very small though), staff speak English; the hotel offers many activities to do in the city which some of them have pick-up services; wonderful breakfast room with delicious and well served food. The room is very clean with comfortable sheets and bed; very silent. The hotel is very close to the city centre so you can go on foot to many places. Our room had a balcony and despite it was in front of a busy street it was ubelievably silent (must be the good quality windows).  Cons: none.","22483":"We really enjoyed our stay at Katane Palace Hotel. The lobby area and restaurant area are pleasant. Our room was spacious and quiet. The only detractor for us was the pillows were too firm.  The breakfast gave us a good start to the day, including local cake for breakfast!  It's location is reasonably central just being a few minutes walk to restaurants cafe shops etc.  We would choose to stay there again.","22497":"This is a lovely family feel atmospheric local hotel. The breakfast is served in a large open air courtyard. The staff are obliging. Bedroom was relatively large aircondioned and quiet. Good sized bathroom. Buffet breakfast was good. There is a nice bar area with plenty of seating. Overall this a good value 4star hotel with a somewhat elegant feel. Maybe it was a palace! A good walk to the Via Etna and the central attractions.","22498":"Stayed at Katane Palace last week - booked 3 rooms. We had an early morning flight in and were very delighted (and surprised) that we were given our 3 rooms at 7am (no extra cost). The rooms are quiet (we were just above street level) - maybe slightly dated but a really comfortable size and very clean. Free water & soft drinks at the mini bar. Breakfast has a decent selection and coffee is served almost before you get to the table. Staff were extremely helpful and everything asked for was done very quickly. I would recomend this hotel and will certainly be using it again on my next visit to Catania.","22500":"We spend a night here on our way back home from the Eolian islands. I knew the area as I had stayed at the Mercury Excelsior Hotel before, which I should have booked once again. But I found a better deal (115 euros per night ) here and the pictures looked good so....  But....this is a real depressing place. Neglected, old fashioned, noisy, without noise insulation at all, be it from the street or the other hospital guests.  On the positive side it was clean.","22502":"is the second time we went back to this hotel, warm reception and very helpful. good and clean room. also a rich breakfast. the location is quite near to the city center with all the amenities and facilities that every tourist need.","22508":"My adult son and I stayed at Katane Palace Hotel in July 2019, the room had everything we were expecting a minor problem with the in room safe was fixed quickly. The staff we\u2019re very helpful and always greeted you with a smile. The little added extra which was nice was the canned soda and bottled water in the mini bar which was free, with temperatures over 40deg C you needed to stay hydrated.","22513":"The hotel has free parking. Yes Free 9 parkings for 58rooms. Go figure! We asked for a quiet room. The smoking hotel gave us a room one floor above the reception. The whole night the door banged and scraped open and closed. At midnight about 30 people went outside to smoke and talk loudly. Just beneath our window !","22514":"Very helpful and friendly staff. Rooms clean and quite big and comfortable. My room overlooked the beautiful courtyard, and I found it very quiet and was able to sleep very well. Breakfast was a buffet and had quite a good selection of items. The hotel is situated in a very good central location of Catania. However the neighbourhood around the hotel is very dirty and dilapidated and only gets better once you reach the main street.","22517":"Nothing special but nothing wrong with this little gem. Very well located for access to the old city and easy walking or driving location. Kinda old school charm but not Basil Fawlty ...more Inspector Morse or if your English think Dorset or Somerset Family run pub with rooms (although its not a pub they will open the bar if you ask). For sleeping and as a tranquil base location defo.","22519":"This is an old hotel in a good central area. The beds were a little hard. The showers were hot and cold which was annoying. The staff were very helpful. Food was okay but should be better. We were on a tour with other people and the Hotel was chosen for us as part of the package.","22525":"My wife and I came to Sicily for a 5 night break, in fact I am sat in the hotel courtyard now writing this as we are about to leave. The hotel is beautiful, the staff are amazing, we have eaten at the restaurant here every night as the food is top quality and fantastic value. Our room is large, very clean but the bed is harder than we are used to so my back ached a little in the mornings. We chose Catania due to it being near mount Etna, but if we come to Sicily again I wouldn't stay in this city. There are far more prettier places to stay than Catania. To sum it up, hotel is old but decorated beautifully, our room was large and clean but other guests make a lot of noise slamming doors etc. Foid is amazing as are all the staff. Parking a car around here is a task but I managed to find a space each evening nearby. The hotel has a small garage and a valet will park for you if they have space.","22527":"We choose this hotel with my family expecially for his central position. We find really gently and friendly receptionist. The room is very clean and a lot of chooise during breackfast. I suggest this hotel.","22529":"Quite a nice hotel, although not 4 stars! Big bedroom with a balcony [no view], large on-suite...but...we had the hardest bed I ever slept in, which gave us both back aches and uncomfortable sleeps; no tea coffee facilities, although we had some fresh water every day. Plastic cups doh! eeek! no heated towel rail in the bathroom and minimal, very cheap toiletries. Breakfast was minimalistic, scrambled eggs were quite dry and cold; on hot water on two occasions and the juicer was broken one day. Selection of meats and cheeses very basic; cold coffee in the brewer so I had to ask waiters to get some fresh stuff. Overall staff were polite and nice and the hotel was very clean. Would I stay there again? - yes I would :O)","22535":"Good location in central Catania. Breakfast has a wide variety of different and very tasty items. Rooms are standard size, but absolutely clean. Very nice staff! As is often the case, the distance between the working desk and the next power outlet is too big for any laptop cable.","22539":"My wife and I went Sicilying for a mid-winter getaway and chose Catania as our home base for a week. The Katane Palace Hotel is well-situated, has comfortable rooms, excellent staff and substantial breakfasts. The restaurant was closed for the season, so I cannot report on that aspect of the hotel. The hotel bar was delightful for wine, coffee and snacks. We would be glad to return to this hotel on a future trip.","22541":"The hotel is located about a 10 minute walk from the heart of Catania. The hotel is clean in an otherwise very dirty city....there is a generous breakfast offered too, which is good value. However, the free parking is a bit of a misnomer because it's first in, first served. The hotel itself is rather bland and charmless and the staff aren't well trained in service. But, if it's only for a night or two and you aren't too fussy about where you lay your head, then it's probably fine.....but I warned you!","22545":"Wow. Great location if you like to walk. They will park your car for you if you are early enough and they have a space available... otherwise? good luck! The check in was good and the room was comfortable but well and truly overdue for modernisation or at least a refresh. The issue that cost them a star was the lack of service at the bar. It was amusing to start with and then increasingly frustrating trying to get the surly boy to serve us and then you had to wait and wait and wait to even pay the bill. Sometimes I had to walk around looking for someone to come and take my money! Very strange.","22547":"We spent a lovely night in this hotel on our way through Catania. Free parking right in front, easy and quick check-in and out procedures, perfectly decent breakfast in the beautiful courtyard. The room was clean and well-appointed and we slept like babies after enjoying a wonderful evening of exploring. Would definitely visit again.","22550":"The hotel was clean and tidy - it felt like an oasis in city plagued by rubbish.  The decor is perhaps a little dated, but comfy nonetheless. The bathrooms appear to have been recently refurbished and are lovely. Breakfast was a continental style with the addition of scrambled or hard boiled egg, which was tasty but slightly lacking.  Finally, the location of the hotel was pretty good with the main sights just a 10 minute walk away.  In summary, not a bad little hotel - a strong 6.5 10. But more importantly....ask yourself if you REALLY want to go to Catania before booking! It is without question the dirtiest city I've been to.","22551":"My husband and I loved this hotel. Our room was spacious, spotless and very comfortable. The bathroom was large and elegant. The hotel parked our car for the night for free. The downstairs was lovely with stately rooms and inviting furniture. A pianist played a grand piano all evening. I wholeheartedly recommend this hotel. I wish we could have stayed longer. We did not care for Catania, however.","22552":"We\u2019ve just stayed 2 nights at the end of a Back-Roads tour of Sicily. The hotel was chosen by BR. Our room (707) second floor overlooking the street was a typical layout, clean, spacious with good a c. The bed was good with sheets & blankets. Older style decor. 10 minute walk to Via Etna & a nice park, then a 20 minute stroll to the Duomo. Breakfast was good, courtyard seating nice, scrambled eggs hot for a nice change. The decor in the common areas like the stairs is in need of repair, but look past this.","22553":"Had a superior room with balcony on 4th floor, beds very comfy and bathroom one of the best I have ever seen and used, powerful shower and constant hot water. Breakfast taken in restaurant with extended courtyard, food excellent only drawback was the coffee from the flasks it was cold and bitter but you can ask any of the very helpful waiters who will fetch you any type of coffee you want from the kitchen freshly made. The reception staff are very helpful with local information and will book taxis etc. Don't be put off on arrival of the litter and dog muck in the street this has nothing to do with the Hotel and sadly appears to be a problem in all side streets throughout Catania. Thoroughly recommend this Hotel.","22554":"Katane Palace Hotel is nestled on a narrow and somewhat unimpressive side street and is located within reasonable walking distance to more than several good restaurants and the Villa Bellini and its gardens as well as to Via Etnea. The property is well maintained, clean and quiet. Our room was a good size, very comfortable and enabled my wife and I to get two good nights of sleep. We found the staff to be very helpful and accommodating. The hotel serves a complimentary breakfast that was quite good; in particular, the scrambled eggs were done to perfection. We really enjoyed our breakfasts in the outdoor garden. This hotel presents an excellent value proposition.","22557":"The staff we met were all very helpful and friendly. The room was clean and comfortable with a very comfortable bed. Individual air con a blessing. Our room overlooked the courtyard, and we found it very quiet and slept well. Breakfast buffet had a good selection of good quality and fresh items. Excellent location,near the main street and an easy walk to the main areas of shops and good restaurants. We would not hesitate to stay here again. Reception staff got us a taxi to the airport on time and the fixed price of 20 euros.","22559":"Not exactly what we thought we were going to get when we booked a vacation package with Delta and asked for a 4 or 5-star hotel to go with our travel. This is considered of 4-star hotel in Catania but it would not be a 4-star by typical American standards. There were no other Americans in the hotel when we were here. The night we arrived, the hotel did not have our reservation and we got the last room in the house which was not even a standard (room 607). Ehen we complained to Delta's in-country service, Gartours, they made it up to us by moving us the next day to what they called a superior - 110 - which would be pretty much a normal room in any American 4-star hotel, although it did have a balcony onto the street it was not one of the rooms with a balcony or window onto the quiet courtyard. A benefit is free parking but better not come in anything much bigger than a Fiat Punto. There is breakfast which is ample enough.. the lobby bar is rarely stafffed and run by a different entity than the hotel.","22590":"Based on the great evaluation in TripAdvisor and Booking.com we chose B&B Miro for one night stay in Catania. Unfortunately our experience was much worse than reported by others. Parking and location are great, Also the welcome by one of the B&B team members - this is worth one star in my evaluation. But the room and especially the bath were extremely small, quality of furniture is lower level and walls and some furnitures definitely need a renovation. The outflow in the shower did not work, the toilet seat was broken. In addition the room was poorly soundproof. No chance to sleep while the neighbors dog was barking all night long, the cars used their horn during the night or other guests returned from their party night. Since we had to leave early and there was no flexibility to offer a breakfast earlier than 8 am we cannot judge the breakfast at all.","22603":"We have stayed here for three night's in total to explore Catania. There was nothing to complain about. Our room was nice and clean. We had a little balcony which was perfect as well. The location is perfect to explore Catania. The centre is only a 10 min walk away and if you are arriving with a rental car there are always some spots left on the street. We had never a problem. The staff was very welcoming and friendly so what else can I say.. 5 out of 5!","22610":"We were a small group of hikers from Germany, and we were delighted with our one night stay at B&B Miro.  Each room is unique. Ours had humourous night tables. The were white children's chairs nailed to the wall at a good height for a night table, but their legs weren't touching the ground! All but one of the rooms had a shower and WC.  Lucia was at the reception and made sure we all had what we needed. She gave us a great restaurant tip, near the B&B. It prepared the best Sicilian appetizers I have ever had and I've been going to Italy for 32 years!  The breakfast room was sweet and quaint, self-service and had a lot of variety. Whatever serving platter was no longer full, it was replaced with a fresh one right away.  Ok, the B&B is located in what seemed to be a run down neighbourhood, but would I ever book B&B Miro again? You bet!","22613":"A very charming B&B. Beautiful and clean rooms in a very nice ambience, where I got a warm welcome. Didn't expected that from entering the main door. This establishment is more or less just a flat inside a big building.  Walking distance to the e.g. Plaza Duomo or the San Berillo Distrikt is about 1.5km easy walking.  I will come back for sure.","22615":"We flew into Catania and the hostess arranged a transfer by Salvo Scordo who was tremendously helpful in introducing the city and getting us settled. Good breakfast, good location. Clean though not luxurious appointments. We were very happy with our stay.","22621":"Th room was clean, on peacefull place, not so far from the center, with friendly staff, good breakfest with bread, ham eggs and jam...Balcony and bathroom were a perfect point and we liked to stay in our room.","22625":"I really loved this place! The B&B itself is very charming and the ladies who worked there were so sweet and friendly to us. Everything was very clean and the included breakfast was wonderful! The location was really convenient too, and we had no problem finding free parking on the street. No complaints- everything was awesome!","22636":"Located right near the city center, this hostel was a pleasant stay. But there weren't many bathrooms available, so there was quite a wait when I wanted to get ready for bed. Also, the room doors don't lock, but at least there are lockers to put your stuff away. Was a pleasant stay to spend a few nights in.","22642":"My experience stopped at stay cancellation. they charged me almost 3 times the amount they are supposed to charge, 62 euros instead of 26 euros. Bookings.com called them and asked why this happened, and responded that they charged the normal amount. so... I raised a complain to bookings.com, I hope that they will manage to get the money back. I will also block the amount on the credit card so my bank will also ask them to reimburse. I can understand why this happend after reading the previous comment, I don\u2019t understand why they are still listed on bookings.","22647":"We were given a dormitory room not like we booked.The receptionist that welcomed us was rude and not helpful.  Definitely would not book there any more we were very disappointed and sure we will never book there again and won't recommend it to anyone.","22650":"doesn't even deserve a 1 rating!  The staff was rude, the dorm room is completely cramped-bunks with only two feet between then and NO room for luggage, the bathrooms are so tiny you can barely use the toilet, kitchen is locked at night until 8am the next morning (and they don't tell you, so if you have to be out early for a tour, then pack everything the night before), there is NO breakfast or even tea coffee, and they charge you an extra \u20ac6.50 in fees that aren't shown in your Booking.com price.... so beware!  Nothing was good about this place... everything was poop-y.","22651":"Firstly, upon arrival, they charged us an extra 5 euros per night per person for cleaning fees, which we did not expect, they did not make it very obvious when we booked the beds. The staff was pretty unfriendly, and not very welcoming. The cleaning staff was pretty rude at some points, and there were a couple of guests at the hotel that seemed to live there that were very rude and annoying at times. We booked many weeks in advance and asked for us to be all together in two bedrooms but we were separated into different rooms with random people, which would have been fine if they at least warned us in advance. There were five toilets to share between all guests, two of which were absolutely tiny. Overall, the service was pretty poor, and badly managed, and the value was not that good considering they made us pay an extra 5 euros a night. Probably one of the worst hostels I have ever been to.","22652":"This is a clean, relaxed hostel in a good location close to the city centre. The hostel has good facilities and helpful - if quiet - staff. The pretty private back courtyard is great for a drink in the evening.","22658":"Where to begin? I was in Italy twice (and other European countries) and never in my life got even one problem in any of the hostels I stood, till I got to City in hostel at Catania-Sicilia, where the nightmare begin and ended up being real.  First time I was in Italy I fall in love with the language and culture in general, I was so in that by the time I came back to my country I sign myself in an ltalian language class. A whole year of studying this language passed by when I went back to Italy to be part of another intensive Italian language class. After a month of having the lessons I finally got the certificate that I wanted so badly, and before I got off my city I put it in my suitcase without knowing that will be the last time I'll see it, just like all the presents I bought for my friends and family in all the places I was before like, Rome, Athens, Napoly, Positano, Calabria, and of course all my personal stuff like clothing, shoes, jewelry, beauty articles, books and studying materials in general. I went to Catania with the intention of watching the biggest volcano in Europe (Etna) and enjoy the beaches. I will only be in the city for one day, but for real I ended up going there to be robed, which I never imagine could happen.  I came to the hostel, and it was late, after laying down a bit I decided to Go out to know the center of the city. I retire by 06:12 pm. Then I came back around 11:30. I was in a room for 10 people (five beds of two floors) the space was really small between beds, and there were no lockers for the suitcases, not even a fan, and of course don't even ask for the air conditioner, because of that the window remain open all night... I got into bed and the day after I woke up by 5:50 am. to enjoy the whole day. I had a big suitcase and also a backpack. When I went to get my stuff I found the surprise that the only thing left in there was my backpack, so I looked for the rest of the room in case someone had moved it or something, but no, I couldn't find it anywhere. So I went to the reception very desperate and there was no one there to help me out, not one soul and meanwhile I was there crying feeling powerless. By around 7:30 am. the cleaning lady arrived so I asked her please to call the person in charge of the hostel and she told me the guy will not answer... So I asked by what time I'll be able to find someone at the reception and she respond after 9:00 am. (a little bit late for a hostel). Waiting up all worried, finally around 9:15 am the receptionist arrived who was at the same time the owner of the hostel.  Trying to stay calm (besides the situation) I nicely told him what happened and he automatically changes his attitude and started acting in defence, with a bad attitude very poorly cooperative. By fortune the receptionist of the place had better intentions of helping me. I realized that the place counts with security camera system so I asked him to please show me the video of last night so we could see what happened. If one of the hostel guests had taken my suitcase that will be in evidence in the video, and the mystery will be solved.  So we started watching the video with the owner present. The receptionist suggests that someone may have entered by the open window of the room, and the owner reacts like making fun of the idea, saying that that will be impossible repeating again and again that nothing ever happen in the hostel, that no one ever got mugged, and that if someone took it, must have been a guest, that the idea of someone getting in by the window was impossible.  Also, when he asked me at what time I left the hostel the day before, even before I answered him he interrupt me saying: \u201cI saw that you were here at the afternoon\u201d insinuating that my version of the facts was a lie (like if the afternoon lasts just a 1 or 2 hours) all the time he was trying to avoid the situation not to take any of the responsibilities,even before we find out what really happened. On one occasion he even try to convince me that watching all the video of the security camera was going to be imposible because it will be too long (Like that he was still trying to avoid the situation) I told him that what happened deserves us to watch it still, and find out the truth and gave me an answer.  After 20 minutes aprox, finally we could watch at the video that two men walking down the street climb the hostel gates (which by the way was extremely low) they got in trough the open window in the room, while we were all sleeping and they took my suitcase just like other guy\u00b4s stuff that was also in the room. By watching these, the owner leaves the reception, and he never came back to talk to me, he was pretending to do any other thing like talking to the cleaning lady in the bathroom, but I NEVER got any apologies from him and less any kind of monetary compensation for what happened. NON of these would happen if the hostel wasn\u00b4t extremely insecure. But what give me more chills till now is thinking that these people had the chance to be with us, so close, and they had the chance to hurt, kill or even rape someone, the story may have been much more tragic and this is very serious.  In conclusion:  1. If you\u2019re going to CITY HOSTEL you can be sure that your belongings and even your life will be in danger. 2. If something bad happens, the owner of the hostel is not only going to avoid the situation, he will also treat you like dirt and If is possible he\u2019s going to blame you for everything, no matter what. 3. You are NOT going to receive any kind of apology and less a monetary compensation for the damage. 4. Give your trip for ended, in which you invest time, money and ilutions.  If these hostel is really \u201cSERIOUS\u201d and looks for the comfort, satisfaction and well being of its guests, I\u00b4m still looking for an an apology and the monetary compensation for the inconvenience and damage caused. I also hope for the security of any other travelers that will make the BIGGEST MISTAKE of staying in that hostel, that they at least include the corresponding changes to avoid future episodes just like mine, directly, if you DON\u00b4T have the capacity to manage a business like this, just CLOSE IT.  Hoping for a positive answer from the owner of City Hostel, I say goodbye sincerely.  Fabiola Sosa","22684":"When I arrived to the hostel, immediately I saw the logo of a prize from the trip community and then I knew why! It had a really nice kitchen, a nice yard, it's very clean and confortable. I had a great experience! It's near to many atractions of the city and the bus station. I really recommend this place!","22699":"I was in Catania on a quick stopover and wanted a comfortable and central base to see a bit of the town. This place was really great and the host, Rob, was very friendly and full of tips for the flying visit.  It\u2019s pretty easily accessed from the airport bus, and is very well located for the sights. The place is extremely clean, and my room was comfortable and charming. The overall d\u00e9cor is sort of old world bohemian, and the whole experience was great.  The street it\u2019s on is perhaps a little bit grungy, but this is true of much of Catania and is in fact part of its charm.","22702":"Booking was easy, uncomplicated and very friendly. Easy to find, centrally located, close to Castello Ursino, street parking was no problem (i.e. no permits required), a warm welcome by the lovely Cristina with fabulous tips for exploring the city. The apartment is charming, quirkily decorated and light. We had room 2, which was spacious and comfortable, with a balcony to the street (earplugs recommended). Breakfast (go for local specialities) was delicious! Two bathrooms (one small, one large) for four guest rooms was no problem. The entire apartment was spotlessly clean (we are German and we defined the word spotless). Wifi fast, aircon heating top, water hot (but please don't waste it). All places of interest (e.g. fish market, Piazza Duomo, shopping in Via Etna) all within walking distance (5 - 15 min). We would highly recommend 5 Balconi. Cristina is a super host, we couldn't have felt more welcome.","22704":"Pros: Cristina was an amazing host. I arrived late at night and was taken aback a bit by the location (my own fault for not reading the reviews closer), so had a bit of a panic. She was very warm and calming and really made me feel better about the situation. She offered to help call around to other locations, but in the end I chose to just stay. I don't regret it, as their hospitality is wonderful. Her recommendations were spot on and really made my trip. Everything was spotless and charming. The breakfast was a lovely and everything was delicious (even if I didn't eat much because i had ruined my appetite on their amazing homemade organic sesame cookies). The place is only a 5-10 min. walk to the bus stop on the Alibus from to the airport and on the long-distance bus lines. And it is in walking distance to the main tourist sites, as well as a good base for going further afield. WIFI good.  Cons: The B&B is on an incredibly busy and loud street, more so than your average city street. All the rooms front the street, and the windows don't really block out much of the noise. And the cobblestoned street means that you can almost feel the cars. If you are a light sleeper, this might be a problem, as it was for me. But Sunday morning was not so loud, so I ended up sleeping okay. The breakfast table is right outside the rooms, so if you are a light sleeper, you also might be woken up by other guests having their breakfast. The bathroom that I shared was incredibly tiny, the shower like a phone booth. Luckily I'm quite tiny, but if you're not this might also be an issue.","22722":"Our holiday in Sicily was truly kickstarted by Rob an Christina who own 5-balcony b&b. Both were enormous welcoming, available at any time and eager to tell us all the whereabouts and hidden secrets of Catania and further inwards Sicily. Apart from the hosts the rooms are absolutely wonderful with its 5m(!) high ceilings!!","22723":"The location is good, quite close to the citycentre. The rooms itself are AMAZING, so beautiful. Actually the whole bed and breakfast is decorated with so much style and everything is really clean. The breakfast is big and really tasty. The highlight for us were for sure the owners; Rob and Cristina thank you for your warm welcome, help and nice talks!","22759":"We are not experts on B&B's by any stretch of the imagination \u2026 BUT, we know what we like. Actually, we know what we LOVE! This B&B was exceptional - from how clean it was, to the delicious breakfast served every morning all the way to the comfy bed - we loved our stay at Bianca B&B. All the major attractions and transportation were just steps away and we were treated like family by both Maria Christina and Francesco. We stayed for 5 days and we did not want to leave. Thank you Maria Christina and Francesco for a lovely stay. We will be back!","22765":"Stayed for one night after arriving in catania for a holiday on the coast. Francesco met us outside, which was great. He and his partner run a b&b in their home. So bare that in mind. The building is old but lovely, in a great location. The room is lovely. Breakfast was simple but the best we had in Sicily. They have a gorgeous dog which would justify an extra cost!!!! Well worth considering if you are stopping in Catania.","22838":"I could not rate this place high enough, absolutely fantastic. Peppe and Claudia were the most welcoming hosts, who both speak excellent English, in this amazing bed and breakfast. Good fast WIFI, spacious rooms, and delicious breakfast. Most recommended.","22841":"Peppe and Claudia are really friendly people, who offer a warm welcome. They are well-placed to be in the hospitality industry, as wonderful hospitality is what they provide. If you need any suggestions, or would like a chat, they are happy to do this. The rooms are a blend of styles; from historic high ceilings and fabulous floor tiles, to contemporary quirky furniture. Everything is immaculately clean and tidy too. There is access to a cosy kitchen, which is useful if you wish to make drinks need a fridge. We had a delicious breakfast Sicilian-style, of creamy cannoli and cornetti, accompanied by your choice of coffee. I am sorry that we were not staying for longer, though hope to return, as Catania is a fascinating city which deserves to be more widely-known. Grazie mille, T and W","22885":"One of the best B&B I ever visited..  Clean , centrally located and beautiful and comfortable room !!  Staff really nice and helpful. Free b fast is a +!  Whoever left a bad review should go in a 5 star hotel and pay hundreds of euros!  Thank you B&B Sicilia.  Will definitely return!","22961":"We stayed at Mio Tuyo B&B for a quick vacation to Catania and were very impressed. The accommodation is new, comfy beds, spotlessly clean and lovely owners. There is a small kitchen with everything that you need to cook your own meals, and a nice Italian breakfast with pastries and coffee is included in the room price. We stayed in the triple room, but liked the accommodation so much that we came back again for a second stay and booked the bigger room upstairs, which has a private bath with spa jets.\r \r The location is in central Catania with everything in walking distance - about 20 minutes to the central station, 30 minutes to the main food market or beach. Directly around the hotel are plenty of shops,cafes and restaurants.\r \r Highly recommended and we will stay here again next time we are in Catania.","22965":"If you're looking for accomodation in Catania, stop because you just found the best place to stay. This bnb is really clean, has everything you need for your staying. The breakfast has everything, coffe, toast, butter, tea, fresh juice. But the best part is the owner of the place, Tania who helped us with advices where to go and how to get there. Thank you, Tania. ","22976":"This hotel is truly stunning. Each floor has a different concept and is filled with unique art. We were upgraded to the Bellini suite room which was a lovely surprise. It was a beautiful and spacious room, filled with light, and even had a grand piano!  Breakfast was delicious and served on the terrace overlooking the square below. The location really could not have been better, it is right in the center of Catania.  The staff were exceptional and went above and beyond for us helping us to organise transfers and tours of Etna. They are all extremely friendly and attentive and really made our trip.I can't fault this boutique hotel!","22982":"Hotel is lovely and certainly different. Rooms spacious and interesting! Staff very helpful and friendly and breakfast was delicious. Centrally placed and a market is on the doorstep. Would love to go back.","22983":"It's difficult to come up with the superlatives to describe this hotel - but I'll try! Wonderful design with various different styles of room - all look fab. The look and feel of the hotel is just brilliant. Ours had the biggest chandelier I've ever seen, right over our bed! Great breakfast, freshly made coffee and highly attentive staff. Hotel is in a fantastic location for exploring this beautiful and atmospheric city on foot, so much to see. Highly recommend taking an Etna trip, the Sicily invasion museum is worth checking out and Siracusa Ortigia is an easy and interesting train ride away. Great local bar 50m away called BarnOut - visit for the decor alone! All-in-all, we could not have had a better break......... the title of the review sums it up!","22985":"Wow what a amazing place this is! When opening the huge front door you are entering into a former palazzo with great art everywhere in and - even outside - the building. The staff is excellent, fast, efficient and very kind. We were staying in the junior suite on the upper floor. The room is big but a part of it has a very low ceiling which you can hardly use, although it looks fabulous. The breakfast was outstanding! The location could not be better, right next to the famous fish market. I would absolutely recommend this boutique hotel.","22987":"This hotel is absolutely outstanding! One of the best places we've stayed in Sicily by far.  Situated right in the heart of Catania, this hotel is the perfect combination of an immaculately refurbed 18th century building and curated modern art.  What we particularly love is the story each room is telling through its decoration. We were in the elephant room, symbol of the city. The wall was made with ceramics from Caltagirone and imitating the skin of the elephant. Our bathroom had 25 mirrors to represent the mage enchantments, where truth and lies chase and hide from each other to finally find serenity in the escape, as the legend tells... an absolutely amazing experience.  And finally I have to mention the art! Art is literally everywhere in this hotel and you can by any piece you like! All arts have been sourced by the owner and is made by the locals - the best way to discover in one single location the best local artist and jewels!  The service was top notch, the two ladies we interacted with at reception were super helpful and gave us great advice on things to do and see, local restaurants to go to and even private beaches.  Breakfast in the morning was great; a lot of choice, great coffee and a lovely terrace overlooking a plaza.  And I almost forgot this hotel has a great rooftop terrace with sun beds and amazing views on the city roofs!  Dont think twice, go go go to this hotel! We will definitively go back!","22991":"What a gem! Everything was perfect. The room was huge and comfortable. The common areas have beautiful modern art. Delicious breakfast. Great location in the fish market and near the piazza duomo. Highly recommended.","22992":"A most unusual converted Palazzo in the centre of Catania. Great location. Art work everywhere give a quirky touch .The bedrooms are thoughtfully furnished and spotlessly clean, the breakfast was one of the best I have had in Italy. Little touches like Marsala and sweets cake available. but the best thing about Azmundo is the Staff. From the minute we arrived to the minute we departed,they couldn\u2019t have been more welcoming and helpful.","22993":"We have stayed in many oppulent places but nothing touches this. My only disappointment was the unsafe neighborhood just outside hotel. Our car was vandalized and a scam operation ensued to fix it and pay the men. We felt unsafe just as we arrived and the locals watching us unload. We trusted and lost. The hotel should provide a designated spot to park.","23004":"We only spent a night in this lovely hotel and less than a day in Catania, in both cases it was not enough time. Catania is a real surprise package and well worth a few days to investigate this surprising beautiful and historic city.  We especially found the area around Piazza Del Duomo to be what we enjoyed most and it constantly surprised us with its architecture and the deep and beautiful history embedded in every street. But at night it really shines and comes alive with so many bars and restaurants to choose from that you would never be bored for something to do.  Asmundo is situated in an old mansion on one level of the building, the rooms are gorgeous, large and filled with light. Each room is themed and has original art pieces throughout and every detail has been thought of, it\u2019s a delight to spend time in the room because they are so rich in culture and not cluttered its almost like having a little piece of a museum in your room. The addition of a small balcony allows you to embrace the city and its surrounding kaleidoscope even more.  Breakfast is a simple but tasty affair held out on the beautiful common balcony overlooking the Piazza Del Duomo. The prices are very reasonable and the staff are very helpful. We will definitely return to Catania and to Asmundo so we can explore this lovely city further","23005":"Fairy tale Experience. We stayed with friends and family during our wedding week. Surrounded by paintings, pictures, sculptures and design pieces from local artists, we felt immersed into the Sicilian culture and we definitely experienced a deep connection to Catania and Sicily. Emotional experience with all our senses pleased. Perfect location, top cleanliness, super professional service. Definitely recommended as one of the top stay in Catania and Sicily. TIPS: Among all the beautiful themed rooms, the Proserpina Suite is outstanding with a fantastic private terrace! Would definitely come back!","23006":"Very old but beautiful beautiful hotel. Art & sculptures everywhere. Our room was huge as was the modern bathroom. We had 2 balconies facing different streets. Breakfast was delicious. Plenty of choice. The second day we were there they had lots of antipasta: arancini balls, eggplant & tomato dish & different pastries. Fresh fruit & vegie market outside each morning till 2pm. 5 minute walk to fish market, close to restaurants & sights. Staff very helpful.","23007":"My boyfriend and I stayed here for 3 nights and it was great. The lady on reception was friendly and welcoming. We were really early so checked in and left our bags and went for a little wander. The room was ready by 2pm. The room was spacious and quirky. Although we were right above the market it wasn't as noisy as we were expecting. The only problem I had with the room was the shower kept overflowing, we should have said something really but kind of thought the piles of sopping wet towels placed around the shower might suggest to the cleaner there was an issue. Anyway, that was minor. The breakfast was brilliant. I'm came home very fat and happy.","23008":"From start to finish this was just a fantastic experience. The hotel is in an old palazzo just a few blocks from the Duomo and the start of the Via Etnea (main shopping street). The entrance is a little difficult to find, but the property is gorgeous - painstakingly restored and filled with carefully curated art.  My room (the Santa Agata room) was stunning - high ceilings, beautiful furnishings, gorgeous bathroom. Breakfast is almost overwhelming in the number of options, all of them local to Sicily, and you can dine on a terrace overlooking the square below. Dafne, the manager, was helpful and friendly from check-in to check-out.  If I'm ever back in Catania this is the only place I'd consider staying. Just exquisite.","23009":"Our host, Salvatore, could not have been more welcoming or helpful to our family on our recent trip to Sicily. The rooms were spacious and clean and the beds were comfortable. A perfect location to enjoy the city. Highly recommend.","23010":"What an amazing hotel! In a restored palazzo in the center of Catania, this hotel is a true jewel. Every room is designed individually and relates to the history of Sicily. Rooms are modern and spacious. We were received by a very kind employee that showed us our rooms. In the morning you wake up in the middle of the market only steps away from the famous fish market and the cathedral. We would come immediately again!","23011":"An absolute delight. Immersing ourselves in the charm and the art and couldn\u2019t wish for anything more fab!! The owners have poured their heart and soul into this venture and we cannot recommend more highly!","23012":"We had to book last minute, after our train was cancelled so we did so through booking.com. Upon arriving at the door around 7 pm (15 minutes after we made the reservation) there was no one to answer at the buzzer. I emailed, contacted through booking, then called and texted. After 45 minutes of still no answer I had to cancel the booking (for which I was charged the full price). They refused to refund my booking and stopped answering my emails.","23013":"a bit surprised first as I could not find it from the street but then I called, the door opened and I felt I have arrived in paradise it is a unique place....more a home full of art and a super friendly and welcoming staff (speaking fluently French & English) rooms are huge and so well furnished mayeb the best spot in all Sicily!","23014":"Every room is decorated in an artistic way, the whole hotel has art written all over. Conveniently located in the heart of Catania. Breakfast offered on the balcony overlooking the street. The hotel is in one of the palazzi of Catania. Great breakfast with natural orange juice, cheese, sweets, and hams. Staff was helpful and friendly.","23023":"A fantastic place and absolutely well worth a stay..it is so unique with all the art work and beautiful decorated rooms..high standard in everything from the rooms to the breakfast which was phenomenal...the have a huge variety and everything is locally sourced..","23028":"Everything about this small hotel is wonderful and unique. Each room is different, decorated in style with unique art pieces from Sicilian artists. The service makes you feel at home. Breakfast is great with all you wish to eat , pastries, prosciutto, cheese... And location is excellent , a block away from the fish market and the Duomo!  We loved it!","23029":"I stayed here for 5 days recently when we went to see Catania and her surroundings. I guess that this is a residence, as it has about 8 rooms and offers breakfast, and no restaurant. The entrance to the hotel is stunning!  Each room is different and we stayed in the Fish Room which was large and beautifully decorated with modern design features and furniture. The bathroom was almost as large as the bedroom! Everything was very stylish, we could have used more shelves for books and other objects but here style rules over practicality...  The breakfast was great, fresh fruits plus cakes as well as the usual bread and toast with a great selection of local jams too. Plus we had Spiderman climbing up the side of the hotel too, amazing!!  Service was friendly, helpful and really could not have been better. We had a really fantastic 5 days and Asmundo di Gisira made a fantastic base for our visit. Thanks guys!!","23032":"Our arrival experience was exactly like those of some of the other reviewers; when we arrived at the address for Asmundo di Gisira, I was sure that we were in the wrong place. With a little coaching from some people in the adjacent piazza, we discovered the big grey doors to one of the loveliest and most unique hotels we\u2019ve ever stayed in.  Salvatore, the manager of Asmundo di Gisira is an enthusiastic and welcoming host who fully understands the concept of hospitality. His staff is smiling and helpful. He made a number of restaurant reservations for us, and his suggestions were always excellent. Our favorite restaurant in Catania was Me Cumpare Turridu.  The guest rooms are nothing short of magnificent. They are very large, airy, bright and beautifully decorated with period furniture and stunning works of art giving one the feeling of staying in a luxurious private home. There were beautifully decorated sitting rooms outside of the guest rooms which added to the feeling of a stay in a private home.  We loved eating the delicious and generous breakfast on the balcony overlooking the city of Catania.  The Asmundo di Gisira is a fantastic hidden jewel in the busy city of Catania.","23033":"We stayed at the Asmundo Di Gisira for 2 nights and it was simply perfect. The location was wonderful, a short walk to all the piazza\u2019s, cathedrals and Roman sites. Our room was stunning, 12 foot ceiling, amazing art and a beautiful cool sanctuary to the activity on the street below. Two balconies showed the hubbub of the town, with shutters to block out the light and sound when needed. The best part of the hotel was the wonderful staff, helpful and friendly, and the breakfasts on a leafy balcony overlooking the Piazza Mazzini were the best we have had. Thank you Asmundo Di Gisira!","23039":"As you are standing in front of the closed door of the hotel, on a narrow, rundown street, you wonder if you have come to the right place, but once you get in, you are awed by the grand entrance hall.  As we made our way up to the lobby to check in, we were told that this building used to be a palace. The staff are very friendly, warm and helpful. We were given a tour of the hotel and received information about every piece of art that has been curated and is at display. It almost felt like we were inside a painting ourselves.  Our room was at the top floor, overlooking a square. It was very spacious and immaculately decorated. Each room has a unique theme. There are common areas on each floor where you actually want to spend time. There is also a beautiful terrace with a wonderful view.  Everything at breakfast was carefully selected from different regions of Sicily and very very delicious.  I just wish we could have spent more time here and enjoyed it more.","23040":"You would never know what a delightful experience awaits you from the front door. It is a slightly forbidding entrance to an old palace. But inside it is an artistic delight from check-in (including a lovely tour of the art inside the hotel by Daphna) to check-out. The rooms are large and comfy, the breakfast is delicious, and the location cannot be beat: the huge central market is right downstairs. Also appreciated being contacted in advance by Salvatore to see if we needed an airport transfer: we did not, as we rented a car at Catania Airport. Wonder of wonders: we were able to park right near the hotel, legally, for two days. Only one comment: there were few places to place things on our room. No shelves to speak of, except below the sink in the lovely bath.","23041":"From the moment we arrived we were greeted professionally and with such warmth you would think we were old friends Salvatore, Daphne and Jadda were just the perfect hosts at this extraordinarily beautiful boutique hotel. Full of wonderful contemporary art work but in keeping with the building\u2019s grandeur; high stucco ceilings and gorgeous airy rooms. The breakfast was exquisite and presented like a Dutch still life painting! The rooms are eclectic and fun but work with all mod cons and even extras such as ambient coloured lighting and the highest rain fall shower I have ever seen. An outside balcony and pretty terrace as well! Of course none of this would work without the obvious love and passion of the lovely kind staff. We shall return and stay longer","23042":"- Rooms are nicely decorated, clean and spacious. Bathroom amenities are from \u201cOrtigia\u201d - good location you can walk everywhere from there with shops and restaurants around - breakfast is ok - nice staff - our room was above the food market and even with the double glazed windows you can still hear the noise. You also hear the noise from the hotel people opening doors etc - the hotel is located in a small street by the food market, the streets can be dirty sometimes","23048":"Tha hotel is located next to one of Catania\u2019s most beautiful squares, in a grand old palazzo. When you leave, you are in the middle of the food market and can easily explore Catania on foot. The rooms are big, the place is filled with art works and the staff is very helpful. Breakfast was delicious. We really enjoyed our stay and will be back.","23049":"Only stayed one night at the end of our trip to Sicily. It was a privilege to stay in such a beautiful hotel, which is clearly so thoughtfully decorated with very high end touches, including lovely antiques and modern bathroom fitting with amazing waterfall showers and ortigi bathing products. Breakfast was tasteful and again high quality. This is a generous boutique hotel and an oasis of cool and relaxation after the heat and bustle on the streets.","23050":"Location: centre of old town, walking distance to all the important tourist attractions. Shockingly, the entrance is smack on a side street of a wet market. (Hence retrospecively I can understand the proclaimed name of an art boutique market hotel!). It was quite scary when our taxi driver couldn't find the location of Via Gisira and left us inside the market. We waded right inside the hustle and bustle, clumsily with our bags, only to find a woodn door with a teeny bronze plaque of the hotel name. It's like a speakeasy??? Nobody answers the faulty buzzer for a while (there's a jumble of Italian names, so please sort this out!), and finally we had to call the hotel. Our anxiety dampens when Salvatore, one of the hotel staff, opens the door. Yet another shock as the foyer is dark with a rather dirty red rug leading to stairs. It smells of rotting vegetables. The same smell that has wafted in front the street market. Is this some kind of a jokeAs I suppress my urge to look for another hotel, Salvatore leads us up the stairs and into the first floor. We turn right (on the left, the door is open and I believe the flat is private and not run by the hotel), and enter an oasis of culture and modernness! The lobby smells of bergamot flowers. What a contrast and surprise!!!!!  Design: an old and partially restoredl palazzo with high ceilings, huge windows and immense attention to arts. The owner or designer has impeccable taste of merging contemporary art with old school baroque grandness. Our room was a twin bedroom on floor 1, room 5. Exquisite spaciousness with an interesting theme of the river in the room. Comtemporay ceramics, lighting, mirrors and chairs grace the room. Well-climatised and Netflix on telly! The bathroom was impeccable and spacious. The windows look directly into the markets where sellers are yelling in Italian. I can see a butcher stall selling horse meat. ( The market goes quiet after 4pm when workers go home.) The other Bellini-themed room on floor 2 was less thought-out. Too much old furniture in the entrance of the room. Bulky wooden tables, bookshelves and piano makes the actual space much smaller and claustrophobic. It seems that the design on the second floor was done more hastily as the contemporary elements ware less obvious. Nonetheless, bathroom was exquisite! Food: breakfast is simple and standard. There's an old-school press-hinge orange juice squeezer, which is fun. Boiled eggs is the only hot dish. Tea-pots in kooky one-of-a-kind shape. A small range of bread, pastries, fruits, ham and cheese. Concierge: hard-working colleagues. There's only one staff at any time. They do everything from collecting dishes to managing checkins. No staff after 10pm. We stayed for three days and met 3 helpful staff. Daphne, Salvatore and Stephano. Cleaning: Spotless hotel once you reach your rooms. Towels and linens are not refreshed regularly though. Suggest improving entrance foyer and staircases.","23052":"This hotel is the most incredible value for what it offers. Very fine rooms with a lot of art all over the place and charming service. Our room had a gorgeous balcony and breakfast was lavish. We will come back !","23055":"From our first enquiry Salvatore and Daphne were nothing but helpful. We took some advise from a blog about getting them to arrange a taxi from the airport, just as well as the hotel is tucked away in a back street with no obvious sign about what it is. But once inside the boutique hotel is very eclectic, quirky but very nice. Art adorns the building, Spiderman in reception and a 9 ft Flamingo lurking behind reception. The room was spacious and well equipped and the breakfasts brilliant with a good selection of local cheeses, hams and breads. It is well placed for the main fish market and the Cathedral square and for local bars and restaurants. When we booked in a Dutch couple were complaining that their room wasn't that clean. We found that one day ours was really clean and the coffee topped up but the next it had only a cursory clean. I'm sure if we had been that bothered we would have spoken to Salvatore. For a relaxing stay in Catania with great hosts you can't beat the Asmundo.","23056":"We knew we had to book this hotel as soon as we saw the photos of a giant foot and crocodile in one of its rooms.  We were given the PROSERPINA room, which tells the story of a beautiful woman who is taken down to the afterlife by hades. The celling is painted with a stunning fresco. There is also a very large balcony area to sit on and enjoy. Very large bathroom with jacuzzi bath and lighting which changes colours.  Very large room and unusual bed canopy, which seems to be in the style of a house.  The rest of the hotel is stunning. Great pieces of art, and sculpture. I particularly liked the painting in our room of a doll.  Breakfast was very good, service excellent. Would definitely recommend this place to everyone. It\u2019s not run of the mill, which is why we loved it, it has real personality.","23059":"Catania is not the prettiest of Italian cities. Especially if you arrive at night and take a wrong turn. We went through a bad part of town before finding this hotel. The entrance is a nondescript door in a seemingly abandoned street. But all that looked sinister at night turned charming and authentic during the day. The same abandoned street turned into a farmers market with the beautiful produce from nearby farms. The boutique hotel itself is a unique experience. You feel like you are in someone's fantasy. Each room is inspired by Sicilian folklore and this is interpreted through modern art. The rooms are very clean, the sheets fresh and crisp. Toiletries are by Ortigia, a high end brand. Breakfast was very generous as very well presented. The city may not have won me over but the hotel certainly did. Special thanks to Dafne who showed us around the hotel and told us about the amazing work that went into each room. The rooftop deck is just beautiful. Don't miss it.","23061":"This hotel had wonderful reviews and they were certainly true! I absolutely loved this hotel. The attention to detail is delightful and the staff are so friendly and go above and beyond expectation. We stayed in the elephant inspired room and the hostess explained in intricate detail why it was thus called. The breakfast was an experience in itself from exquisite art work to the choice of fruits, breads, meats, cheeses and juices. It is centrally located and the entrance is an understated grey door off a back street ( took a bit of finding the first night in the dark). I would highly recommend this b&b and would certainly stay there again.","23069":"The small hotel has very nice rooms with high ceilings. The host is very friendly and helpful to find the right places to visit not only in Catania but also in the neighbouring areas. The hotel is very central and many restaurants are close by.","23073":"Angela is a dreamboat. She is so sweet and the pup is adorable too. Beautiful apartment and very centrally located!  note: If you have a rental car, you can find parking on the streets around the building. Travel hack: sweet talk the cops- they will let you drive down the street to drop your luggage off (it's the main street in Catania so they block it off except to taxis).","23075":"We stayed for 5 nights, great location in centre. The owner was really helpful in advising best places to eat and visit , and left her number if we needed anything Great breakfast with a good choice. Room cleaned daily.","23103":"As the name in implies, Aeroporto Bellini Rooms is just that a room near the airport, it is very much basic, no frills compact accommodation for early flights out or late flights in, the latter is what we used it for. We walked and had a bit of difficulty in the dark, making our way through the maze of car parks from the airport, as we don\u2019t have mobiles with internet capability. The accommodation is less than 1 kilometre from the airport.  The room is quite small but very clean. It is part of a neighbourhood so the sounds of others is very audible. The rooms all lead of the same area, so it can be very noisy with guests arriving, slamming doors and talking loudly.  It was serviceable but glad it was only for one night.","23112":"This apart hotel offers a spacious room with a vaulted white-washed ceiling (featuring an ancient-looking fresco!) and the house itself is very traditional, with an inner court; the walls of the room are decorated with pictures (some of them beautiful) and in general the room has a nice feel. The floor is tiled so bring your slippers!\r The bathroom is en suite and it does feature a bidet as advertized but because of that the toilet had to to fit in a tiny space next to the sink, so it's quite cramped. I would prefer no bidet and more space for the toilet. The shower fixtures are very modern and high-quality but it takes a while for water to get hot. That was about the only hiccup.\r The mattress and pillows are very healthy and convenient.\r The room has a tiny balcony opening on the street.\r The wi-fi signal is very strong, completely flawless.\r The apartment is located in the city center, in the midst of tourist sites and only 15 minutes by foot from the central railway station.\r The breakfast is served in a cafe across the street but it consists only of a croissant and coffee.\r The host speaks little English but is very friendly and helpful.\r So after I figured how to use the key to my room, I had a wonderful stay and would come here again!","23121":"Very new accomodations by the Mediterranean Sea and a 10 minute walk to train station. Spacious room with very comfortable bedding. Hosts are very helpful in giving information about Catania. This is a western style facility and only named after the Hotel Oriental that was in this building centuries ago. Breakfast is a full buffet and cooked eggs Room is extremely quiet","23125":"We made a City trip for 3 nights. The Homestay was in the middle of the town. The owners are very friendly. We had one aircondition room with a sharing toilet. All was very Clean there and got cleaned every day new. The breakfast was good too. You can Work 5min to the Bus Station and Take the Bus for 1\u20ac to the long beach easily. I would come again and stay there.","23194":"I Stayed here for my birthday with my sister. We had a bit of difficulty finding the B&B as it was tucked in the corner of the main square but the locals were very helpful and showed us exactly where to go. The location was ideal for getting around Catania and only a short walk to the bus and train station. The staff were very helpful and had arranged bike hire for us with a local bike shop. We found the room to be large,airy and very clean and we loved the idea that you just helped yourself to breakfast when you were ready. It was also lovely to be able to use the kitchen when you came back from a long day out and about. We would definitely recommend this B&B","23199":"This is a lovely place. The rooms are very clean and spacious. All done to a high quality. Wifi dropped out every now and then but still fine for work. Toto the owner is extremely accommodating and very friendly. The is a nice seating area out the back and lovely pool that Toto has just finished doing up. Breakfast was also very nice. Overall a lovely place stay. Thanks","23203":"In Sicily there is a government incentive for the locals to refurb old buildings rather than build new , our host Toto has done the most amazing job refurbishing his B&B what an architectural master piece , from the outside you would have no idea but inside quality quality quality , he picked us up from the airport and even dropped us off at the airport , he spent considerable time offering local advice and was on hand serving breakfast every day , great value and great service , highly recommend Toto I remember the HD","23204":"This is a great place to stay close to the airport. It has secure parking and a lovely pool. The owner is very helpful. It takes about 20 mins to walk into the centre of Catania. There is a great fish restaurant just a short walk away.","23215":"An excellent B&B, located less than 10 minutes from the airport. Sciara Biscari doesn't look much from the outside, but inside it is extremely comfortable and stylish, and the rooms have every amenity. The owners are very helpful and hospitable. Highly recommended!","23217":"As other reviewers have written, Sciara Biscari is a beautiful building from the inside. Our room was spotless & comfortable. Toto picker us up from the airport at 10pm as agreed (for a fee) & it was wonderful to be picked up by a friendly face. Breakfast was good & we enjoyed eating it outside. Our only complaint is that we were woken very early (6am) - first because we heard people moving around (owner getting breakfast ready?) & soon after that a very loud party started on the beach. We didn\u2019t mind too much but if you were hoping for a lie-in, it\u2019d be a problem. However, if you\u2019re looking for somewhere clean, comfortable & affordable to stay near the airport, this is it.","23227":"My wife and I stayed 1 night with a reservation. We drove our rental car 83 km N from visiting the UNESCO Necropoli di Pantalica. Google Maps brought us to the front door marked with a dull steel and a bright white sign. My wife rang the buzzer and soon the English speaking owner came out to assist in unloading our bags, then leading the car to his gated parking. Entering the compound, Iole explained the architectural remodeling of the 200 year old buildings into their contemporary home that includes a 5 bed B&B, opened 2 years ago. We were impressed with the safe-like entry door and the office lounge area that included a small kitchen nook with coffee tea available at all times. The project reflects both earthquake-resistant building and quality details throughout. He showed us the garden patio before leading us upstairs to our quiet loft. The large tiled room had a comfortable queen, 2 nightstands, open closet, long table desk with chair and refer below, wall TV(no English), and a nice fully outfitted bathroom with glass door shower. 2 skylights with shades add ample natural light. We had good secure internet, very hot water, good AC heat, a quiet night\u2019s sleep, and a nice 7:30AM breakfast buffet; OJ, coffee, eggs, rolls, cheese and delicious homemade desserts. We followed Iole\u2019s instructions to walk 800 meters south to a Trattoria for lunch, then strolled the long sand beach. This accommodation was chosen for its easy auto access and to return our rental car before our flight out of CTA, a good value stay for us.","23228":"We had a lovely holiday staying here, it is such a surprise when you walk inside. Toto couldn't have been more helpful with ideas and suggestions giving us a map and pointers of the best places to eat visit etc. The swimming pool was an added bonus and just the thing after a hot day out, along with gelato from just around the corner!!!! Thank you","23229":"This hotel looks nothing from the outside but you step inside to a 5* space which Toto has made unique keeping the historical original walls but created a really fabulous hotel The location is actually perfect for both easy access to the airport and hire car firms as well as walking distance to the Cathedral in Catania We had heard warnings of driving in Catania but here you have a secure parking area and easy access avoiding the stress of driving The rooms were very spacious beautifully decorated and well appointed bathroom access to a terrace and swimming pool in the garden area Breakfast was excellent Toto's homemade Canoli were delicious We had good communication both before we and on arrival this is a definite recommend","23249":"This B&B is an excellent choice for those starting or ending their Sicilian travels with a flight arriving or departing Catania airport. I feel it would also make a great base for a longer stay in Catania as the centre is not too far away by bus and there's apparently a beach in the vicinity. The fabulous hosts are Toto and Lole who have created a beautiful, stylish and extremely comfortable boutique accommodation with lovely rooms, thoughtfully appointed with exceedingly comfortable beds with beautiful linen, strategic lighting and great bathroom. There is parking and a private garden for those with time to while away, and a small but beautifully designed reception foyer breakfast area with tasty treats, magazines, tea and coffee at all times. The hosts' superb home adjoins the B&B - all designed by an architect and incorporating parts of the former residence built of lava rocks. It's stunning, extremely comfortable and quiet with excellent security. Toto went out of his way to assist us with our car rental return and transfer to the airport for our very early morning flight. His recommendation for dinner at the nearby (200 metres on foot) Osteria del Faro was great: the simple, slightly down at heel exterior gives little idea of the charm and great food within, and the friendly staff. Altogether we thought our brief stay here was top notch and highly recommend it to others.","23278":"Sciara Biscari was a fantastic surprise. After many many disappointining BBs in Catania, finally we found the one we will akways go! New, modern, clean, romantic near the light house, close to center, port and airport, with excellent wifi, rich breakfast, friendly owners!","23293":"I had a super nice stay at Solea while working over the weekend. The hospitatlity was excellent and super friendly but relaxed with Margarita and Vittorio putting me at ease from the start.  I was there for work, but during time off Margarita showed me some spots to visit and took me out to see some of the sights. After work, the room and dedicated bathroom were really spacious and great to relax and sleep in. The bed was really spacious and comfortable.  Breakfasts were lovely in a really bright and relaxed room. Sicilian marmalade (and I don't like marmalade) is the best and other days I had canoli and other cakes as breakfast extras.  Everything about my stay here was lovely. Solea is the best b and b I've stayed at anywhere.","23295":"I really felt at home in this apartment, hosts were super nice and provided the best service a guest could possibly get, everything was clean and tidy and location quite central in a safe area. Super recommended!","23297":"This was a great place to crash for a couple of nights - the room is well appointed (we even had a mezzanine level in the room with another bed upstairs) and the bathroom was good too. Breakfast was quite basic, but fresh and clean. It was less than \u00a335 a night for two people including breakfast and for that it is amazing. The room was on the busy road, so it was a little noisy, but you can get that at any hotel, and be paying a fortune for the privilege!","23300":"This is a great hotel, front desk available 24 7, which was convenient for us since we arrived at around midnight on the first day. Front desk staff very friendly. The room and bathroom we had was nice, big enough. Clean towels every day, cleaning service is good. Cleaning staff did not speak English, but that did not bother us too much as we only had encounter with them on one day of our total 5-night stay. The neighborhood is not too nice, but it is not the worst either. There is a lot of trash on the streets, but that is not the hotel's fault, as that is the case through all of Catania (what we have seen). The central bus and train stations are close by (cca. 7 min walk), grocery shop is also nearby (a few minutes away). The breakfast is included in the price, they offer a few variety of bread and jam, honey, nutella. They also have coffee, yogurt, juice, water. Breakfast room is nice, clean. You have to stop by the front desk every morning so they print you the breakfast ticket, which you have to give to the staff at the breakfast area. They also offer lunch and dinner, but since we were out of hotel for most of the day, we did not try that.","23307":"We visited Catania for a weekend and chosed this accommodation becase it is close to the piazza where the Etna public bus leaves from (10 mins walking) and has a 24 7 reception (we arrived to the city after midnight and it was a bit difficult to find a place close to the bus station that offered late check-in at no extra cost)  The staff was friendly, the room was clean and big with towels and toileteries provided. Breakfast was also good (bread, croissant, some sweets, jam, cheese, salami, cereals, juices, tea and coffee)  I recommend this place if you arrive to do the Etna trip and want to do some sightseeing.","23315":"An unusual place to stay, definitely not a hotel but quiet, clean and comfortable.  Breakfast was fairly basic but adequate to start the day. The rooms are clean but despite a few requests to reception the A C never actually worked which would be a problem in summer.No safe-deposit box at reception nor in the rooms. The large rooms adjoining the road can be noisy, without a balcony and had zero views. The single room had a nice view in towards the courtyard and had a small balcony. Location is good about 15 minutes walk to the centre. There is a bakery just along the road which does take-away fresh pizzas and reasonable price.The side roads around the Camplus are very run-down and lifeless, many are boarded-up. Doesn't feel that safe after dark round there as there are so few people around.  The paradox is that Sicily despite being poor is very expensive. If you have difficulty walking, it isn't easy getting around town as taxis are are extremely expensive and on a level with London black taxis. Do not take the Yellow, hop-on, hop-off bus because it is a con. They will take you on a tour which you cannot get-off despite being told that you can when they sell you the tickets. Restaurants are not cheap either and watch out for the mystery 'cover-charge' which is added on to every bill.  Mount Etna is not easy to access despite what the guidebooks say. Strangely there is just ONE local bus per day which departs at 8am. We found out that the train that goes around Etna is probably the best way but again it has a limited service each day.  Syracuse is worth a visit and unusually easy to visit by regular train service which takes about an hour.  Overall, yes I would probably return here to see Etna, Syracuse and the coast north of the city.","23316":"We were travelling around Scilly as a group of four with bikes and spent the first and last nights in the accoccmodation. We had excellent split level rooms with seperate beds, all very comfortable and clean. Breakfast is simple and the coffee was awful. Our room faced onto the road but it was not too noisy at night. There was a good secure area to leave the bike and we could also deposit the boxes we needed for the bikes for the flight to Catania. The place felt like an calm and clean oasis in the middle of a bustling city. The staff very friendly and helpful.","23317":"Basically student digs but nice all the same. Area feels a little dodgy but there are quite a few trattoria and pizzeria within a 5min walk. Breakfast is included but is sparse (juice, coffee, croissant and yoghurt). Reception staff are very friendly and there is a nice central courtyard if the weather is warm. City tax was \u20ac1 on departure.","23334":"My wife and I had a wonderful experience at this hotel. The location can\u2019t be beat, the rooms were comfortable, and the staff were extraordinary. Over the course of our stay, various travel plans fell apart and we sat down with the knowledgeable and caring staff, specifically Sergio to name one, who helped us salvage our vacation with alternative plans. This felt like \u201cour home in Catania.\u201d","23335":"Great location next to Duomo square. Staff were nice and helpful. Room modern and comfortable. Roof top terrace was wonderful with great views of Mt Etna as well as Duomo and streets below. Breakfast ok.","23336":"Firstly, it's expensive. However, once you cross that bridge, you'll get a nice room, and what must surely be one of the best rooftop views in the city, looking out over that beautiful cathedral at the end of the road. Excellent central location, while our room was pleasantly cool and quiet.","23337":"On the plus side: The hotel is centrally located and has spacious, clean rooms. The cons:  1. Newlyweds and newly engaged get the \u201cdivorce\u201d room. All rooms have a movie theme, one of those is divorce. We were just engaged to be married and they put us in the \u201cdivorce room.\u201d When we complained, they told us about a \u201cfunny story\u201d when they put a newly wed couple in this room as well and they were upset. Story concluded. Not funny. The whole thing was bizarre.  2. It was raining during our stay so not much to do in off season - I got a massage at the spa and it was the worst massage I\u2019ve ever received. My standards aren\u2019t high. This woman was not trained, which made me wonder if this was a front for something else, or if the service staff is just untrained and no one does a reference check. As a woman, being touched by someone who may not be a masseuse for an hour felt violating. I complained. Again, got no discount, but an offer for more massage services? What in the world!  3. When we had questions about the city or recommendations, the staff were unhelpful. We were attempting to get a couple of tours booked and we were met with shrugged shoulders or head nods and a lot of \u201cyou can do it yourselves on the Internet.\u201d  4. The beds and the noise. Slept one hour the first night. Felt like the street was partying in my room. The bed is more like a futon.  In general, felt a bit like the staff was messing with us but Catania is on the rougher side and seems like it\u2019s not a big fan of tourists. If you have higher standards stay somewhere else, another city even perhaps. This is a 3 star hotel, attempting to look like a 4 star, but it\u2019s not even close.","23338":"The hotel definitely has character with each room decorated after a film made in Sicily. Besides, the location could not be better: it is literally several steps from the Duomo; the staff is exceedingly helpful and friendly; views from the rooftop terrace are fantastic; and breakfast is great. Unfortunately, during my stay in November it was already a bit chilly to enjoy it on the terrace, but the breakfast room has a panoramic window so one can still have a view of Etna accompanying one's morning coffee. Excellent hotel, would be happy to stay again.","23340":"Duomo Suites is an ideal location to see Catania. Reception staff are incredibly friendly and rooms modern with small kitchen. The roof terrace was a fantastic place to spend lazy afternoons sipping Prosecco ( you are encouraged to buy your own and enjoy the view) Breakfast was the only negative.Three out of our four mornings we encountered a disorganised waitress ( there\u2019s only one each morning). One morning she sat me in front of what was obviously the cutlery drawer and proceeded to bang my chair trying to open the drawer to reset the tables) until I had to move ( no excuse me or do you mind moving from where I told you to sit ) She loved smoking on the staircase   playing online poker and talking loudly on her mobile phone in the breakfast room. The choice for breakfast was incredibly poor for someone who eats healthy ( if you love sweet pastries and cakes no problem). But trying to communicate with the waitress was incredibly difficult ( to ask for a banana or yoghurt) . On out third morning a new waitress appeared who was incredibly helpful and immediately seated us and offered to cook eggs ( scrambled fried omelette etc ) completely different breakfast experience. But morning four the original waitress was back! Overall great place to stay for room   location and reception staff","23347":"Centrally located only a few steps from the Duomo and the lovely church dedicated to St Agata,, the hotel although small, has large beautifully furnished rooms and large bathrooms with very efficient air-con! It is very impressive inside despite one's initial concern from the outside appearance-- don't be put off.  The staff are very helpful and speak excellent English. We were extremely happy with our choice and would revisit if in Catania again.","23348":"We had two rooms for 5 people. One of the rooms had a separate kitchen dining sleeping area so it was perfect for us and our adult daughter. We had the Godfather room. We only stayed one night, the roof top has a nice view of the Duomo. The breakfast room was on the top floor and was nice and sunny and we enjoyed the buffet breakfast. The lobby is small, just off the street. The location is good, just steps from the Duomo, fish market and major shopping area in one direction. We also were able to walk a few blocks to the bus stop to catch a bus to Syracuse.","23349":"Booked this accommodation based on TA reviews and it didn\u2019t disappoint. Modern clean rooms and excellent location. Everything you need on your doorstep. We visited the Duomo, 2 amphitheatres and used the local train to get around.","23351":"Excellent location but be careful at night. Walking distance to many restaurants, markets, and cafes and almost right in front of the duomo. The rooms were unique and decorated nicely with plenty of room. Staff was very friendly and helpful with recommendations. Street parking was convenient right outside the hotel. The rooftop terrace was beautiful with amazing views of the duomo.  This hotel was A bit pricey for Catania but this did look like the best hotel around. Breakfast was not included in our rate which should have been at the price we paid. Not the hotels fault but the we almost got robbed when we were driving in from the airport to the hotel, the road is not very safe so lock your doors in your car at all times. A scooter blocked the road while his friend opened the passenger side door and tried to grab my purse off me, my husband reached over and slammed the door on his hand and floored it. Not a safe town in the dark but lovely during the day. Will not return to Catania.","23352":"We met probably the best reception staff we have ever met, including Hilton Hotel staff, in Serena Tringale and Sergio Buscheni at this property who were just so friendly and welcoming that it made the trip from Rome seem so worthwhile. We had a suite, the Sedotta, which even had heated toilet seats and had one of their in-house massages which added to the whole feeling of relaxation. In addition to this the property is so central that we got to see much more than we would have anticipated in our three day stay - and when we left for Taormina they were able to arrange a taxi for us at a really good price and with a driver who was able to re-arrange our accommodation in Taormina when the property we had booked in at, Villa Sofia, and paid for in advance to Booking.Com went askew. We came away from Sicily with very fond memories of the people we met at Duomo Suites and Spa and immense gratitude that their impeccable service which continued with the taxi driver who they arranged for us.","23356":"On the positive side: very central location, comfortable bed, very good breakfast (not included in price). Negatives: very, very cold, and no heating in the bathroom. Staff not helpful, although we asked for help from different receptionists. Hotel is trying to be very fancy with moviethemes and \u201cintelligent lighting\u201d, but it did not work in our room - so was also a poor experience. When we checked in the receptionist told us that all information we needed could be found on the in-room smart TV - but he did not show us how it worked, and everything was only in Italian, so not really helpful for a non-native. Although location is very central, it also means that our room was right above the famous fish market, which opened very loudly every morning around 5 AM - after which it was difficult to get any sleep. One reason why we chose this hotel was that is was a spa hotel. We were surprised to find just one set of slippers and no bathrobes in the room. We found out (we could have checked when we booked so the hotel is not to blame for this) that access to the spa was 20 Euro per person staying at the hotel, so we didn\u2019t use the spa after all. We got the impression that the room had been vacant for a long time before we arrived; the drain in the sink smelt really bad, like it had not been flushed for several weeks. So the room had apparently not been prepared for a visit. When we checked out we talked to a fourth receptionist, who was very surprised at our complaints and offered us the last breakfast for free. Very nice, but should have come the first time around. So all in all we will never come back - and can only suggest others to find a better hotel; unless you are very much into Italian movies and can live with poor service (at a fairly high cost).","23359":"Amazing weekend spent at this boutique hotel. A very big thank you to the hotel staff which is very kind, so helpful and caring : Serena, Elisa, Maria, Mariella and Sergio. It was such a treat to be able to enjoy breakfast with typical products and delicious homemade pastries by Elisa on the gorgeous rooftop. What a start of the day with such a city view and the Etna in the background ( when there is a clear sky)! The hotel is located in the heart of the city so it is perfect spot. To park the car not far away from the hotel is possible as well, you have to search for blue lines parking spaces and do not forget to get your ticket at the parking meters for the required time. Furthermore, I enjoyed room Cinema Paradiso very much: what a beautiful room! Therefore, I highly recommend DUOMO SUITES & SPA with its wonderful staff for a stay in Catania.","23367":"Although the street of the hotel and the surrounding blocks look like you are in the wrong movie (quite dirty, run down facades, many cheap shops, ...), we liked the stay and the hotel. The hotel, with cinema as theme throughout the building and in each room, is located in a totally renovated building with four floors and a roof terrace, in a super central part of Catania. The roof terrace offers great views of the Duomo and could be a hot spot in town, but is now under exploited (nobody really goes there, although there are loungers and chairs). There is a small reception at the ground floor. The breakfast room is just below the roof terrace floor. The welcome was friendly and helpful (despite the fact that we had to drag our luggage ourselves out of the car, the guy who welcomed us, helped me with standing on the parking spot he had detected to keep it reserved for me when I had to remove my car from the street; he also let us see some other rooms as an alternative for the one we were initially allocated but which we didn\u2019t like at all). We got as inital room the Il Padrino suite (we had booked a suite with city views though), and were disappointed because the room is on the top floor under the roof and has no city view windows, only roof velux windows. Also, the coach in the kitchen had several stains and the atmosphere of the room wasn\u2019t to our liking at all. They were willing to get us another room and let us see the alternative suites we could get, the day after, as all were occupied for our first night there. So day 2 we got Paolo il Caldo and loved it. It has big windows and a small balcony and offers true city views and makes you really feel connected with the city. There is a nice kitchenette - living room (actually all suites have that) and a very special round bed. All the staff and especially the house keeping ladies are very friendly and will do everything to make your stay memorable. The hotel is quite high tech and there is a whole series of buttons to dim the lights, to change the colour of the light in the shower, and in certain rooms to open and close the roof windows and the shades. The thing we didn\u2019t appreciate was the breakfast concept: a small selection of products only, not really worth the detour, and a closing time of 10am. We felt that breakfast could be an experience if served on the roof terrace, and offering something more than what you can get in the many bars around the Duomo square. No real added value for the current concept. If you come by car, like we did, it\u2019s important to find a good parking spot as parking can be difficult. We were lucky and could find places close to the hotel where you could pay with credit card. The bathroom amenities, a local Sicilian cosmetic brand, are very nice and exclusive. The beds and pillows were of great quality. We didn\u2019t use the - small - spa so I can\u2019t give any comment on that one. If you like small scale high end boutique hotels with an original concept and friendly service in the centre of Catania then you shouldn\u2019t doubt a second to pick Duomo Suites and Spa.","23368":"we had a great experience staying at this fine modern chic hotel. Very modern interiors and very sophisticated rooms facing the duomo. Very friendly staff and excellent location. Each room has a balcony overlooking the busy streets and the hotel has a elevator for heavy luggage.","23370":"It's a bit quirky but that makes it more interesting. The rooms are all different, themed on old Italian films and ours was not huge but comfortable. Staff are friendly and so helpful. It's about 100 metres from the Cathedral Square (hence the name) and there are plenty of bars and eateries very close by. Not sure Catania is my favourite Italian city but it has plenty of history and astonishing views of Many thanks Etna from the lovely roof of the hotel - where there is no bar as yet but we were encouraged to take a bottle bought from one of the many wine shops close by and while away on the comfy seating there.","23373":"Stay away from this place. Absolute worst experience ever. The day before our stay we got a message via booking.com saying that the hotel coup not accommodate our reservation and suggested we take care ourselves of booking a new hotel. I called the hotel to complain. Weak apologies and bad communication throughout for what we think is overbooking . They also forgot to cancel our hotel transfer as well and bad communication continued so we had to tell the poor driver who had made the trip that we were no longer taking him. Booking .com tried to reach us with a number we could not call back. By then we were on our way to the airport... and the price is outrageous compared to where we ended up staying !!!","23374":"We stayed in the Seduced & Abandoned suite and it was lovely, on the 2nd floor at the rear of the hotel.  The location is excellent, just a few steps from the Duomo Square, it is right beside the fish market and one of the main shopping streets.  We found the hotel to be very clean, the bed sheets were lovely and crisp. Great big comfortable bed.  The rooms are full of technology, lots of lightning in each room, they have USB charging slots at each bed side, Nespresso machine, sink, fridge etc. They also offer breakfast although we are not morning eaters so didn\u2019t use this facility so can\u2019t say how it is.  The people in the hotel are really helpful, they arranged a trip for us, which was excellent.  I would definitely recommend.","23375":"We spent six nights in this boutique hotel at the beginning of June. The location is excellent right near the square but amazingly quiet in the hotel. The desk staff are outstanding. The breakfast room is lovely but the offerings are quite poor for the price as the breakfast is very small and the breakfast kitchen is a tiny cupboard. That said, the chef is very polite and will make you a fresh omelette. There is a Nespresso machine in the room but not genuine capsules. There is also a minibar fridge. Nice wet room bathroom and excellent wi-fi. There is a nice roof terrace to real in. Right next door is a little grocery store which is surprising cheap so you can stock up your self. The hotel prides itself on its electronic gadgetry which posed some teething problems but the staff sorted these promptly and with a smile. Lots of restaurants nearby including the fish market but best avoid these as its a bit of a tourist trap! Would strongly recommend the hotel overall.","23376":"We spent two nights in this hotel in May. It is a small, modern boutique hotel (12 suites) trendily decorated. The situation is ideal, just two minutes walk from the Piazza del Duomo and close to all the other attractions of the city. Room and bathroom were pleasant, spacious and calm despite the hotel's central location. The bed was extremely comfortable. The desk staff were also very helpful. Breakfast is reasonable, although served in a small room. One regret; the shower gel and shampoo provided were little plastified sachets more suited to a two-star hotel. A great shame since this hotel deserves better. If this could be improved this hotel would be perfect.","23377":"Great location.  Lovely modern rooms. Comfortable beds. Quiet street even though on a few minutes walk from the Duomo di Catania  Staff were very gracious and helpful for sightseeing and restaurant recommendations (of which many were a very short walk from the hotel).  Breakfast was delicious.","23379":"We absolutely loved the location and people who work at the hotel were super friendly and super helpful. The fish market is around the corner and it is a must. I strongly recommend this hotel. Spend some time on the roof terrace.","23382":"Stayed here for 2 nights after a hotel down the street denied we had a reservation. Enrico was great as was Mariangela. Great rooftop view! Parking can be tough. Walk to anything important here. Great restaurants nearby and breakfast available at hotel if you like. The incredible fish market of Catania is at your doorstep! Super contemporary!!!!","23383":"We stayed in the Paradiso room lots of space great views on the corner of the street so one balcony was over looking the market and the other the main street. In the best location great places to eat just a couple blocks away. If you want to be in the middle of everything in Catania and get a great night sleep this was the spot. The Staff was great too anything we asked for was taken care of. The Roof top terrace was nice to enjoy just take your new favorite bottle of wine and relax on the nice lounger seats. It was great. I wish i spent more of my trip here.","23387":"My first time in Catania and chose the best hotel and location.  This is a modern boutique hotel, just opened in 2016 consists of 12 suits, each suite has its kitchenette.  Plenty of light in the room, each suite is named after an Italian movie.  Breakfast is simple","23390":"Beautifull location, very clean room and nice roof terrace. In the heart of city centre, just 100 metres from main square. For a short visit to the city, the right hotel to explore the city by feet. I would choose the hotel again next time.","23392":"Great location... close to touristical and historical areas. Small but cosy hotel with elegant renovation, modern look. Hotel's roof has a super Etna view. Receptionists are very helpful, try to solve all your problems. Average breakfast menu.","23394":"Nice, spacious and modern apartments, very centrally located. If you however do not come with earplugs do not expect much of a sleep - the apartments are facing very busy road and it seems that owner did not invest in insulation so even if you close every window in the apartment you may feel as if you are outside with the playing crowds, passing buses and clientele of the liquer store right below of the apartment. Also the place is for you if you are cold water lover - after 15 min wait for something warm flowing from tap or shower we gave up and postponed the shower to our next stay in Sicily in the more reliable hotel.","23396":"We had a very spacious suite, all the mod cons you would expect in a well run hotel. The lighting system is brilliant and well advanced also loved the heated toilet seat, thumbs up for that one ( it also glows up at night so no need to turn the light on ) overall our stay was lovely and no complaints. Each of the people on reception were warm, friendly and well informed about the local area. The only down side I would say is that it\u2019s advertised as a Apartment & Spa Hotel.  If you have a look at the spa it\u2019s a small shower that seems to change colour and they have a massage room, the spa or shall I say shower costs \u20ac20 to stand under it for an hour !! I could honestly just do this in my room.  But over all the experience was a pleasant one and I would return if I was ever in Sicily again.","23399":"When looking for hotels in Catania, I was attracted to the Duomo Suites &Spa for its unique movie theme rooms. It also has a good location, walking distance to many sites, cafes and restaurants. The staff, specifically Sergio, was very helpful making recommendations on places to visit. He also helped me coordinate an excursion to Mt. Etna.  I would recommend this hotel to solo travelers as well as couples.  If you use booking sites to find good rates, I would recommend that at the moment you are ready to make the reservation you do it from the hotel's web site. You can get a very good deal at check in.","23400":"Our generous hosts arranged a wonderful rooftop terrace reception when they realized we there visiting US military members, they took take of everything and it was amazing! The view from the roof looks straight out to Mt. Etna, it's only feet from the square and has the most fun movie themed rooms. I'd love to go back and would happily recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Catania!","23401":"100 metres off the Duomo Square, quiet despite the location. Modern spacious, the suite we had would have contained 2 kids as well as a couple. Immaculately clean with good facilities incl backout blinds for siesta. charming staff, good massage in the spa. Mins away from the more interesting bars and restaurants. rooftop terrace, with great views, no bar facilities yet but you can BYO form the off licence opposite and picnic stuff from the Fishmarket. never managed to get up for breakfast but the room looked good We had a great time","23402":"Great boutique hotel steps from center of Catania and the Duomo - St. Agatha. Rooms are well appointed, bed comfortable. The manager, Sergio, could not have been more welcoming. He was terrific with suggestions for walking, museums, and restaurants. Helped us with our luggage and room walk through.  Don't miss the daily market...right next door! Fabulous! Thank you for a wonderful stay.","23403":"Fantastic location, friendly warm accomadating staff. We loved Catania & will definitely be staying here as a family again. The rooms were spotless and well equipped, very stylish spacious & comfortable. We cannot praise 'Duomo Suite' enough. We had a perfect stay:ok_hand:????","23404":"Small boutique hotel centrally located just off one of the main squares in Catania and a few minutes walk away from the main street of Via Etnea. The rooms are very modern. Our room was on the fourth floor (window overlooked houses at the rear so was quiet - hotel also has rooms with balcony overlooking Via Garibaldi). It was equipped with a kitchenette and a mini bar with a limited stock of non alcoholic beverages and water. Bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was a good size with a shower. Toiletries were provided. A safe was available in the room. Ample space to hang clothing and also good drawer space. Wi fi worked very well. Ample choice of TV stations. Breakfast, which is served in a small but naturally lit room, was continental with a selection of cold meats, cheese, fruit, yogurts, juices, tea and coffee. Very attentive and polite waiter. Hotel has a great open air roof terrace with seating space (accessible by one flight of steps from the fourth floor) with stunning views of the Duomo and surrounding areas. Facilities include a spa but we did not make use of this. No lounge area. Lift to all floors . Very friendly reception staff who also helped us with taking our luggage to the room and explained the various electronic switches etc.","23405":"Rooms and location are really good. Maybe too many electronics that they have no time to explain. But for this price you expect someone helping with bags, having a garage nearby where to park, have a nice breakfast. You do not have them. They are kind.","23406":"We had a 3 night stay here in the Prostino suite, very cleverly designed comtempary accomodation. The room was lovely and the rooftop terrace was definitely worth a visit both for breakfast and in the evening, looking forward to the bar! The staff were very polite and extremely helpful, recommending some excellent places of interest. The spa was lovely but would benefit from extra facilities such as sauna and hot tub. Overall an excellent place to stay in the the perfect location for visiting Catania. Would recommend.","23407":"We have just spent 11 night at this wonderful hotel situated in a perfect position only 100 Mtr away from the main square in Catania Sicily. We stayed in the Paradiso suite which was excellent in every way. Wrap round balcony s. Mood lighting etc. We stayed on room only basis. Which worked well as the daily market runs down the side of hotel. Which we used daily to get our breakfast. Fresh bread cheeses fruit etc. You must experience this daily market if staying in Catania. We loved the vibe of this city and found great places to eat and enjoyed some great food and cocktails. As well as all the local place to visit. Enjoyed train journey to Palermo for day. And also local buses to Taormina and Siracusa. The staff at the Duomo Suites were excellent and would highly recommend staying here to enjoy this lively city. X","23410":"We stayed in Catania for one night as we were flying out of Catania. There aren't a ton of great hotel options for families. We have 2 young kids and didn't want to have to book two different rooms, so the Duomo Suites provided a good, reasonably priced option.  We booked the Royal Suite Cosa Nostra. It was a fun space - very modern with most all the amenities you need. It was very clean, and well laid out.  The staff were extremely welcoming and helpful. The hotel is a little hard to find if you're driving around Catania for the first time. I was easily able to park on the street across the hotel and the hotel staff guided me on how to use the meters correctly so we wouldn't incur a fine in the morning. They even fed the meter!  The hotel is small   compact, and you don't have the big hotel amenities. But for a spacious suite option very near the Duomo, it's a good option.  The only issue we encountered was my wife felt very cold in the room she was sleeping in with my daughter - not sure if there was a thermostat issue or not?","23423":"We had a lovely time at this hotel run by an amazing family. The rooms are clean, very spacious, new and the kindness of the owners made our stay and amazing experience. The food is truly Italian home cooked meal. The pasta \u201cAlla Norma\u201d was delicious!! They are available to help you whenever you need it. We felt very welcome. We would recommend this hotel for a great Sicilian experience.","23460":"Great location. With easy access to swim in the sea. Very comfortable bed and great staff. Nice to stay away from the hustle and bustle of the city. We would definitely recommend this hotel to others.","23466":"After reading a few mixed reviews we were a bit worried about our stay. We booked on the hotel website for 7 nights in a superior room with sea view and got a great price with airport shuttle included. Our room was spotless with the towels changed daily and the bed 3 times in 7 nights. Only criticism was the pool as a lot of the mosaic tiles were off and in the pool, the hotel did provide pool towels everyday and there were lifeguards at both the pool and the decking area. Around the hotel were cafe bars serving mainly cakes and ice cream,2 pizza places and a tapas which was very good. We walked into the centre of Catania, a couple of times, 30 minutes to the main shopping area and nearly an hour to the square and il duomo, with the local markets and side streets which was lovely and well worth a visit. We took an excursion through the hotel to Etna and Taormina which was very good and worth seeing. In all a lovely holiday, we did need to try to speak Italian especially in the local areas but everyone was very friendly and welcoming.","23473":"The staff was excellent. Clean rooms! Attilio and Giuseppie we\u2019re especially accommodating. Rebecca, Alessandro, Francesco, Giovanni and Sylvia we\u2019re friendly and helpful! The solarium is amazing. Swimming in the Ionian Sea was a thrill of a lifetime!","23486":"Third time we went to this hotel and I do not regret it at all. Very helpful staff, great breakfast and good free parking. Although the hotel needs refurbishment, it is very clean. Close to hotel are some great restaurants.","23499":"Clean room and bathroom. Nice and forceful shower! Free parking! Welcome drinks! The private 'beach' which is a set of pedestals built on rocks leading to deep water with fishes! Friendly and helpful staff! They extended check-out time by 2 hours at no extra cost! Close to supermarket and amenities! Standard size swimming pool!  Average breakfast! Unmindful room service, we were two people and housekeeping only provided one tea-cup and one set of tea-bags in the room even after raising this to the front-desk a couple of times, eventually we gave-up! Far from city centre (18-20 euro taxi).","23506":"My husband and I stayed here on the first night of our Sicilian holiday. As a stop over hotel it was fine; clean, good sized room and the common areas were well maintained. It also had good free parking an advantage in Catania! We eat in the hotel restaurant as there were no nearby places to eat and the meal we had was really lovely. Staff were all friendly and helpful. Overall not a bad experience but not sure I would rate it as a four star hotel.","23511":"We stayed at this hotel in early September. We chose it for the facilities that we were looking for (swimming pool, sea location and proximity to the city centre). The hotel and room were very clean and the staff excellent to deal with (very friendly and most helpful when needed). During the day the hotel was quiet with plenty of room around the pool and private beach area). Due to the local geology the 'beach' is a decked platform with sunbeds, parasols and steps going into the sea, which suits able swimmers. There are good restaurants within walking distance and the city centre is a short taxi ride. The breakfast was very good with a good range of continental and local breakfast fare on offer.","23517":"A great weekend based in Catania travelling around the city and down to Siracusa. Beautiful hotel with amazing service especially from Antonio who really looked after us. The hotel is very funky and amazingly positioned for sightseeing in Catania and also 15 minutes walk from the main train station. Would definitely recommend.","23526":"A diamond in the ruff for sure. It\u2019s good little hotel to stay if you get only one day off to walk around down town. Really good pizza restaurants within walking distance from the hotel. The staff was very nice and the breakfast was good and fresh every day. Would stay again and for the price it wasn\u2019t a bad business trip hotel.","23529":"Giacomo at the front desk was particularly helpful. He went out of his way to make sure we had a good visit -- offered us a complimentary cappuccino, stored our bags, etc. And Catania deserves far more international recognition as one of the most vibrant cities in Italy. Highly recommended.","23532":"On my recent visit to Catania, I wanted a place that was centrally located, as my friends were staying in an AirBNB down the street. My room was clean, modern, cozy and typically European. The decor was cool and hip. And I had an overall great experience. I booked through LOL Travel (Italian owned company) at a considerably lower rate than all the usual US booking sites. At first, I thought the LOL was going to be on me as many reviews of that site seemed not so great, but to be safe, I confirmed with the hotel to ensure no hiccups and all went smoothly. (I'd book through LOL again- no problem.)  If you have a car, parking can be tricky at first as the front desk wasn't really clear on where the official parking is located. The street meters wouldn't take my card, so I finally got one of the doormen to explain the best lot is just around the block, is gated, and only 9-10 Euros per day. He also said, Do NOT leave your car on the street overnight. I had no parking dilemmas the four days I was there, and my almost new BMW rental was unharmed.  The only issue I had was with my room key cards- which never seem to work at any hotel. But the front desk was very helpful. Also, I needed a cab one morning very early (6am) for a ride to the airport- but it never arrived. That wasn't the hotel's fault. Just keep in mind, Catania isn't Atlanta.  I would definitely stay at Romano House again.","23533":"I wish tripadvisor gave us the ability to rate on a variety of issues, not just one overall grade. For example, the Romano House hotel in Catania was pretty good, and had very pleasant staff persons. We woke up each morning, however, to a large puddle on the floor of our room, which they never seemed to be able to fix. While I understand that old buildings can have leaks, this just wasn\u2019t acceptable.  Location is fine, not far from the main walking streets and good restaurants.","23534":"This is a reasonable hotel, probably just 4 stars. The rooms are pretty comfortable and bathrooms quite good. The public rooms have a modern design, both restaurant for breakfast ( which was fine) and the bar. Both are not really relaxing places the bar in particular is what I would call ultra modern. but the barman, Antonio is good and serves a decent cocktail.  All perfectly adequate, but not great.","23535":"We travel a lot in different parts of Italy and in Cicily also, but never experienced before what we got in This hotel. The first night we got a very dirty room with insects crawling around the sink, the sheets were grey color, when all over Italy they are snow white, the towels... Draperies ripped. I had to ask for slippers and robes. they gave me the first ones and after I brought my iPad and showed the description of the amenities , they gave the robes and told that these things they give on request, no tissues in the room, next day they moved us to a little better room, but still not up to a four stars standard. Everywhere we get bottled water complimentary, here it's \u20ac2. Everyday we came for breakfast, they had shortage of sausage or croissants or some other things, I had to go back and ask for it, one day I had to leave without getting it. I could go on and on. Don't understand how people do business without having any idea how to perform. First they should send their people to school and hire more people. After Hotels.com called them about my complaint, they denied every single point, but I even saved the pictures and can show the proof. One knolegeble person there was a man in reception by the name of Jacomo, who was heplpful, but, unfortunately we met him the last two days before leaving.","23536":"The Barman Antonio makes the very best Aperol Spritz ! The bar is very modern and along with the friendly staff that makes it a great place to stop for a light meal and a cold refreshment ! The hotel is in a central location so it\u2019s easy access to the sights in Catania.","23541":"Entering the hotel was suprised at the wierd modernistic furniture in lobby, but nice and clean. Went to our room, corridor like a state penitentuary, gunship grey. Entering the room, it smelt musty looked like a prison cell, the bathroom I am sure was cool when installed 20 yrs ago, but now worn out bathroom, even the tap had the chrome worn away completely, soaps etc not replaced when empty (although it is suggested you ask for them if you need them replacing, I thought that was the housemaids job!!) It was a miserable room to spend any time in, only had 1 x hard garden chair in it. Luckily it is well situated to visit the town, if you ignore the 5 story slums that are directly opposite when you leave the hotel..","23542":"I booked the hotel through the internet seeing the professional pictures which dont match the reality.. I have been travelling for more than 30 years in and around europe never see a hotel like this.. as simple as can be... 1 bed, 1 chair and an armchair... rest is the walls which are stained. No complementries. We were 2 hr earlier in the hotel and waited for the room to be cleaned.. To our surprise entering the room toilet and the floors were dirty. The bed linen shows that prior guests have just left and they even didnt bother to change the sheets.. Lastly location is just in the middle of crime center. I wished the receptionists should warn us for the sake of their customers. I thought the standarts of the hotels in Sicily like this but when travelled around the island we stayed in 3 hotels which have the same price but 10 times much better cleaninesswise and luxurywise Never and ever again. I never recommend to anybody Binnaz Ay","23544":"Very nicely equipped boutique hotel. The room was very quiet and clean. The staff were all very helpful and friendly with us. Breakfast was really good each morning with a choise of cold and hot buffet. Lots of fresh fruit and lovely baked goods and Filippo served us a perfect Italian Cappuccino!","23545":"We were a group of 7 ladies who traveled all over southern Sicily. The Hotel Roman House was our first and last stop in Sicily. It was memorable for its location,sumptuous breakfast, the cleanliness of the rooms, and exceptional service at the front desk- from a lady named Greta. She is was warm, attentive and extremely client-oriented. I left my laptop in my room and she was there meeting me halfway in the lobby with said laptop. My room mate and I had the most enjoyable stay and I have already recommended this hotel to family and friends.","23549":"We stayed here for four nights as part of a tour group. We had one full day free to ourselves and took full advantage of it. First, let's start with the staff. The folks at the front desk were all friendly, attentive and had perfect command of English. We also found the bartender to be equally helpful and cheerful. Our group expanded to six or seven people for pre-dinner cocktails. We had lots of perfectly prepared Negronis and not-too-dry Martinis over the course of our stay. I strongly suggest you take advantage of his skills.  The rooms were more than adequate although, as others have mentioned, I never figured out how to control the room temperature. After a bit of fiddling, I simply turned it off and the room remained comfortable enough. The bed was extremely comfortable.The reason to only rate the hotel with 4 stars is that there is a large amount of street noise that went on until 3 or 4 am.  The breakfast buffet is quite varied, and you will be served small bite-sized freshly prepared cannoli at your table. Don't resist!  Finally, the location is a bit of a problem. It's obvious (to city folk like me) that you don't want to turn right as you leave the hotel - especially at night. On the other hand it's a quck and easy walk to sites such as the Opera House or the Duomo. (Take the free tour of the Opera House- it's really good.) There are many restaurants nearby.","23550":"We were 4 nights at this hotel, our last lodging after a 2 week Rick Steves tour around the island, from Palermo to Catania. 2 nights were with the tour & the final 2 on our own. There were many pluses and really only one con over our stay. Truly Outstanding are the front desk staff who from the moment our group arrived graciously assisted each & everyone of us & continued to do so whenever assistance of any kind was requested. The breakfast room is spacious and was graciously & abundantly stocked each morning of our stay. The hotel is particularly attractive in its interior which blends the old (preserved ceilings with frescos & plasterwork ornamentation) with the new in a chic combination.  The hotel is in an interesting location. Just a few blocks in one direction is a gracious street that is often if not always a pedestrian mall bookended by the duomo at one end and a lovely, tiered park at the other end. But, if one takes a right, rather than a left out the front door, one can find one's self in a sketchy area that reputedly may be the red light district of the town. (We heard that others were so warned by a policeman & we saw that section from the safety of a horse drawn carriage that took us from the duomo square throughout the entire old town neighborhood. To be fair, this sketchy portion of the town is certainly not the fault of the hotel & it is quite small or compact & it borders the opera house neighborhood of the town which is really lovely. Catania overall is diverse, replete with Baroque era structures some of which are beautifully maintained & restored & others of which remain in ruin.)  The only con of the hotel, itself, was that the AC Heating unit seemed to be on either a timer or motion sensor control & would go off after it was operating for a few hours. Thus, one would awaken at 3 or 4 AM due to the discomfort of the system turning off. The room was of a very generous size and the bathroom was well equipped. Overall the hotel has a feel of real Rat Pack era glamour. If the AC heating system had operated more smoothly I would not hesitate to rate this hotel as Outstanding. Its location issue is not that troubling. One should just be aware of it so one does not wander in the wrong direction.","23551":"This is a recently renovated hotel. We only had one night there and we loved the excellent beds. Breakfast was very good with excellent coffee. The hotel is in a good location for exploring Catania. The staff were very helpful.","23553":"It is a beautiful building which was probably built quite a while ago but kept in a good state. I must say that the two young ladies at the reception were very helpful and gave us a comprehensive guidance as to where to go, what to see and where to eat. None of their recommendations disappointed.  The hotel is c. 5 mins away from a square where a local market is and they had a concert there in the evening. Piazza Duomo is c. 7-8 min walk and there is an amazing local restaurant, Trattoria Casalinga da Nino Mannino, right around the corner run by a family for a few generations.  We were upgraded to a suite which was a very nice touch and the view from the terrace was over old Sicilian houses which made you feel the history of this town.","23554":"Spent 3 nights then 4 nights, before and after a tour of the island. Very nice hotel, convenient location, although some streets around it are a bit seedy. Maybe 10 minutes or so with luggage to the Main Street for the airport bus.  Staff in all areas pleasant and friendly, great breakfast in the restaurant, delicious cannoli with coffee! Good thing I am not staying any longer!!  A little over my usual travel budget but it was a good choice and worth the extra.  And there is a lift.","23557":"The hotel is very new in sn old building. Room was nice and looked upscale but a couple of issues. While, unlike many mid rsnge hotels, the shower was comfottably large the temperature could have been warmer and drainage was slow. The air conditioning cut out our second night. The hair dryer shut off after 30 seconds so it took several trys to dry hair. The breakfast was very good. A lovely terrace on the roof to relaxe. The area was a litttle sketch. Police diving by at night warned not to walk one direction","23559":"I was a bit nervous approaching the hotel by hire car in the morning rush. Frankly, I thought I\u2019d messed up. The hotel is an oasis of calm in a busy city. There are great restaurants and bars in the area, and there is secure parking a street up. We started and ended our week\u2019s vacation here, and I was genuinely looking forward to coming back. The front of house staff do a great job welcoming you and offering advice. The rooms are clean and airy. The barman, Antonio, looks after you brilliantly. The red wine he offers was amongst the best I tasted all week, and was another big plus to coming back. We plan to come back to Sicily, and we\u2019ll come back here. That\u2019s the best compliment I can give.","23561":"We stayed at this hotel for 7 nights and used it as a base for our Silcilian adventures. This hotel has many contrasts so be careful what you like and don't. First what we did not like; the noise. The hotel is on a busy street which has tremendous acoustics - we could actually sing the songs from the bar down the street! Normally, the closed window would solve this, but this time of year they did not have the air conditioning on, so we had to try to sleep with the windows open. Second the showers were only warm, not hot -- sometimes after going all day you want a hot shower. Finally, as others mentioned if you go 100 meters to the right of the hotel you run into several streets lined with prostitutes at night.  Now the good. The location is right in the heart of the city's culture, food and markets. It takes 2 minutes to be in the center of the fun. Number two, the employees are super. I mean every one of them are nice and helpful. In 7 days we never had a bad experience. We even used their recommended car service the whole time. Third, the bar down stairs had great food and drinks - Antonio was awesome.  We are happy with our stay there as it was our first time and might consider it again for a different time of year.","23564":"This was my second time to stay at the Romano House. The neighborhood is not the best but the Hotel in great. Very large modern rooms, great service and a very good breakfast that come with the room. Room price is in the average range. The hotel is a short walk from the train station.","23566":"This was the last hotel on my Rick Steve\u2019s tour of Sicily. I stayed a few extra days and enjoyed the peace and quiet. The service is excellent. Antonio, the Bartender is very friendly and helpful. His smile was a welcome sight after hours of walking and exploring the city. Rooms are big and comfortable... Breakfast buffet is great. A great choice here in Catania!!!","23569":"This was the last stop on a tour of Sicily and it was a great way to end a visit. The hotel room was large and modern with nice amenities. The treats at the bar were plentiful and totally unexpected. The best was the service. Our flight out was canceled due to ash from nearby Mt. Etna and the staff helped us reroute our travel detour which was quite complicated. We really appreciated that.","23576":"I have been here for work a few times. The hotel rooms I have had arproblemeithe fine. Comfortable bed, clean room, refrigerator, tv. A few of the people I was with on business had a problem with ants in their rooms. The fitness room is rather small but better than nothing, however the treadmill doesn\u2019t seem to work. Nobody I work with could get it to turn on. The breakfast is a normal breakfast for this part of Italy, but not a huge selection. I would stay again if my work is paying but not if I got to choose the hotel and were paying.","23577":"It is a very good hotel with nice , helpful and customer oriented staff. The breakfast is normal but you order a coffee they will bring you also a complimentary little cannolo siciliano. It is very central and very convenient if you would like to visit Catanis","23578":"We grabbed a drink at this hotel while deciding where to stay in Catania. When we tried to make a last-minute reservation, we encountered a nasty customer service from the Romano Hotel Manager, a short woman with long dark hair. She insisted there were no rooms available, even though rooms were available through Expedia. (She claimed that she would not honor our reservation if we made it through Expedia!) The hotel looks nice, although it is located in a dodgy area where there is a lot of prostitution and drug dealing.","23579":"We stayed for one night at beginning of our trip and were in an absolutely fabulous, quirky room, 101. It had no external windows and looked directly down into the reception area, which was a bit problematic because of noise during the night. We returned for a further three nights and initially were offered what could only be descried as a cupboard, smaller than any halls of residence accommodation. We could not accept this room, and eventually were offered a suite on the third floor. It was perfect but we had to climb up to this floor as the lift did not go that far. Not a problem for us, but if we had been less mobile might have been difficult. The room itself was absolutely fabulous and more than made up for our disappointment at the previous offering.","23582":"We arrived here on Sunday October 7, 2018 for a one night stay at the recommendation of our tour guide to meet up with our tour group that afternoon. We were shown to a lovely spacious room overlooking the street. The air reeked of dime store perfume that made us sick to our stomachs. We requested the desk address the problem and were assured that they would take care of it during our lunch. We left the large window open and the air conditioning running on maximum fan. When we returned after a leisurely lunch the air was no better. We were offered a broom closet room with a bathroom designed for dwarves. It still reeked of dime store perfume but not quite as bad. Needing to meet our group we accepted the room over protest. They refused to refund any money.  I am a retired physician; these types of odors can incite a cascade of reactions in human lungs and should be assiduously avoided. Stay away if you value your lungs. Nice big rooms if you do not care.","23583":"The superior quality of the front desk staff is what made this hotel stay an excellent one. Marco went above and beyond to rectify the travel glitches and arrange car rental and transportation issues that could have made our trip a disaster. The room was standard with suboptimal ammenties and the breakfast was average. The location was excellent and close by to great restaurants such as Street 54. It is the over the top front desk is what catapulted the score into the excellent range.","23584":"Lovely charming staff at Reception. But no tissues in the bathroom, no shower cap not even two bars of soap, and the most mysterious- a magnifying mirror stuck on the bathroom mirror but at a height of about 2.50 meters - no way I could reach itt. So I\u2019ve come to the conclusion that it\u2019s a hotel for men.","23587":"We had a pleasant couple of days here. We had a nice large room almost like a suite. The finishings were a bit basic - like the curtains and woodwork (well plastic) but It was light and comfy. The double bed was two beds pushed together as they were uneven in the middle but we slept well. Lovely toiletries and bits and bobs in the bathroom and room very clean and the cleaner we met was very friendly. Well stocked mini bar fridge. Breakfast was good. A good selection of fruits (apricots were tinned), cold meats and pasties. No hot eggs (the only hot food on offer at breakfast) the first morning (Monday) - the waitress on duty never spoke or acknowledged us, eventually we just sat ourselves down and worked it out ourselves. On Tuesday the same waitress was much more friendly welcoming and pleasant (perhaps she was just having a bad day the previous day and that\u2019s ok). All the other staff were very friendly and polite. Reception area very nice too. We ate in the restaurant one evening. Staff lovely especially the girl - she was great. Food ok.","23589":"We stayed here with a group of travelers and found the location to be perfect for walking the town and finding good restaurants. Our room was clean and comfortable. Only complaint was a slow draining bathroom sink.  We found the staff to be most friendly and helpful. Breakfast offered many choices. The only thing we would have preferred would be better cereal choices not in individual boxes and more fresh fruit. The cereal issue might just be because not many people prefer that for breakfast. We had a drink on the rooftop which was wonderful with a great view of Mt Etna and also dinner in the restaurant which was relaxing and delicious. Service was great. Would definitely recommend this hotel.","23590":"We had a great stay at the Palace Catania. First it was conveniently located and within walking distance of the sites we wanted to see as well as to restaurants and shops. Second, our room was quite spacious and was one of the quietest hotel rooms we have ever stayed in. We were there on New Year's Eve so we were concerned that the party in the rooftop restaurant might keep us awake, however we never heard a sound. It was very convenient to have the staff park our car and all of the staff at the hotel were very friendly and helpful. We would definitely stay here again.","23591":"I stay at this hotel often and I really like all of the staff. They are super helpful and friendly. The rooms are always clean and tastefully decorated. If I ever need assistance, I know I can count on them to help me so that is a nice sense of comfort. The breakfast here is very good as well. Except for the scrambled eggs, they\u2019re a bit wet and not fluffy, kinda swampy and soupy.","23592":"A great hotel - very happy with everything... the city of Catania - not so much! Unless I'm missing something, the town is dirty, stores are closed and nothing happening here (except MT ETNA of course - which you can get to other ways). I wish I'd stayed another day in Taormina instead.","23593":"The hotel is well located. The room is just ok, but the worst part in our experience was that they crashed our rented car in the garage, and when they saw we have hired full insurance in the rental contract they didn\u00b4t assume the responsibility. I think this is dishonest.","23594":"Hotel rooms are tiny, suite still very small, lacking daylight (window to loud Via Etnea in the middle between two floors thus neither giving light to the seating area not the bedroom), service weak with respect to getting a car, helping with baggage, refilling amenities as well as requests for New Year\u2018s Eve, no functioning baby cod available for two days, English often not understood, management sorry but not competent to implement changes or make up for terrible service - not recommended for experienced travelers. However, breakfast on the rooftop terrace is great with good service and wonderful views of Mount Etna.","23596":"This was our last hotel during a wonderful tour through Sicily. We stayed here for 4 nights and enjoyed the hotel. It's located on a busy shopping street and in a good location to experience this part of the city. There are many nearby restaurants and is very close to the ruins of the Roman amphitheater.  The hotel is very well kept and clean. Our room was comfortable, clean, and adequate in size, with good a c and wifi. The breakfast room has fresh, squeeze-it-yourself orange juice and a fairly good selection of food and drink.  There is a 7th floor restaurant and terrace that affords a nice view of the city and a very nice view of Mt. Etna if the weather cooperates.  There is nothing not to like about the hotel.","23599":"Ideal location for visiting Catania, spacious and very cleaned rooms with friendly staff and very nice fresh orange juice in the breakfast; also, worth enjoying an italian coffe on the 7th floor deck while starring at the Etna in sight. Definitively we recomend the hotel and we ensure we will be back.","23601":"Quite nice hotel. Stayed in a large double room with a comfy bed. Good location right on the main street with many shops and close proximity to many restaurants. A huge variety of toiletries. A nice rooftop restaurant. Although paid, Parking available. The only downside is no electrical outlets by the bed. I also noticed that the prices at the bar and restaurant is a bit pricy but this was the case in general in Catania.","23605":"We expected a room with a view of Mt. Etnea. No way. The hotel is on a busy shopping street and faces shops and offices. But the location is great and just two blocks from the best pedestrian restaurant street in town. Every restaurant on that street is great. Our favorite was Currtigghiu. We had a duplex king room that was great. Room 320. 2 story loft bedroom 1 1 2 bath. Mini bar included. Rooftop breakfast. That is where you have a great view.","23606":"Excellent hotel in all respects. Central situation. Professional reception staff with excellent local knowledge, good selection and service breakfast and quality rooftop restaurant bar. Quiet and well fitted bedroom.","23608":"This is a well positioned city centre hotel that feels like an oasis of calm once you walk into the reception. The rooms were lovely and the roof top bar for sundowners was also lovely. We ate in the restaurant which was delicious!","23611":"This hotel has been totally updated. The rooms are clean and lovely. The beds and pillows are very hard though. The bathrooms are very nice and clean also. They serve breakfast every morning which is very nice. There is a bar and restaurant on the top floor with tables outside with a perfect view of Mt. Etna. I did enjoy my stay there","23612":"We stayed at this hotel as it was the end point of our Sicily tour. The hotel is in a great location. Close to restaurants, shops and the main attractions and there is a rooftop terrace with views of Mt Etna. Our room was clean and spacious and I would definitely recommend this hotel.","23613":"I enjoyed my stay in Catania in this hotel, first for two nights, and then later on in my trip to Sicily, for one night.  The room was clean and comfortable, shower was hot, room was cool. The bed was a bit hard, but it didn't bother me. The sicilian breakfast on the top floor, with a view of mount etna was wonderful for both the vista and the granita and coffee.  The location is perfect: the hotel is right across the street from the Bellini Gardens - a gorgeous public garden where locals and tourists relax for lunch or for a pre-dinner stroll. Within a 12 minute walk is the Fontana dell'elefante. I highly recommend a trip to the outdoor markets. The action packed Pescheria is a 15 minute walk from the hotel, where you will find fisherman hawking that day's catch. I've never seen so much animated life in such a small space. There is also another cool open market with a similar lively vibe, very near via Pacini, which is right next to the hotel.  The front desk was great with assisting in arranging my taxis to Aci Catello, Ortigia, and later, to the airport.  If you get tired of the hustle and bustle of Catania, I recommend an afternoon trip to Aci Castello. A very pretty village only a 25 minute cab ride away with a Norman Castle, a small nature preserve, a view of the sea complete with a jumble of boats decked on the shore, a piazza with a great restaurant with the most friendly owners, residents taking their evening stroll at dusk and kids playing ball in the piazza. It may have been my favorite afternoon in my nearly 3 week vacation.","23614":"Best location in Catania, right on the main street, and close to restaurants. Rooms are nice and very spacious. We parked our car in the garage basement which was very convenient. Easy to walk around Catania. Check in took a long time, be patient.","23616":"We normally book 3*, so 4 nights at this 4* hotel was intended to be a treat, but we were mildly disappointed.  Our room was the chief disappointment. There was not enough space for our suitcases or storage of clothing. We were unable to find a way of turning all the lights off at night and had to sleep with one bedside light on, but dimmed. The air conditioning was very noisy, but if we turned it off the room got too hot and stuffy.  The biggest hassle was charging our devices. There were no power sockets near the bed. The electricity only came on when our room key card was in a dock by the door, so when we left the room the electricity was turned off, which meant that if we had left a device re-charging then it did not charge.  One reason for booking this hotel was the view of Mount Etna you get from the roof terrace. Unfortunately, the weather was cloudy for our entire stay, but we had a meal in the terrace restaurant anyway. The food was good but the menu wasn't very extensive.  The staff were friendly and polite. Not all of the staff at the desk spoke good English and were not able to give us advice we needed about local transport etc.","23618":"I was expecting a bit more based on the TripAdvisor reviews. First impresssions not great, the young lady on the front desk with model good looks (long blonded hair with a lot of dark roots) clearly imagined she was far too good for this job, was most disinterested and unhelpful, my husband nicknamed her \u201c miss congeniality\u201d in an ironic way. The room was nothing special and the wifi was so weak it kept dropping out and in the end we gave up, lucky we were not business travellers. There were a lot of group tourists there plus a conference so the lifts were always full. The breakfast buffet was not that great. The rooftop restaurant and terrace had a nice view of Mt Aetna but the prices were extraordinary. Maybe there is not a lot of choice when it comes to hotels in Catania but I can\u2019t really agree with all the other rave reviews.","23620":"We were part of a tour group so the hotel was chosen for us & they chose well. It's very central but our room was quiet. On entry there is an air of calm & class. There is a fabulous Etna view from the rooftop restaurant & we found that there was more chance of it showing in the morning as it was often shrouded in cloud. It can also be visible at the end of the street to the right as you exit the building. There are loads of restaurants a short walk away & the market & all the main sites are easily walkable. The room was well equipped & had unsecure but fairly stable wi-fi. The light switches took a while to fathom out but that became a trait of Sicilian hotels! The breakfast was very good & the food in general was acceptable considering the size of our group.","23622":"Centrally located on via Etna, there is a great early morning view of Etna straight out of the lift on floor 7 where there is a roof level restaurant and outside bar, which is a really treat place to have a drink. Prices at the bar are reasonable. Our bedroom was spacious with a good bathroom. Air conditioning and a good bed. Reception helpful but slow! Local restaurants are very close. A good night\u2019s stay","23623":"We always stay at this hotel when going to Sicily. The roof terrace is amazing and you should always order their special Sicilian breakfast to be served outside overlooking Etna. The location is perfect down town","23624":"Stayed here for 3 nights this week  Staff great  Executive room very large but very monochromatic - all stark white, no pictures etc - felt very cold  The trouble with white walls is they mark very badly so the room felt grubby  Strong drains smell whenever sink was used too  The breakfast (with the executive room) on the 7th floor at the etnea restaurant was excellent (loved Rosella)  We had dinner there too - it was the best meal of the break","23626":"We had a great night's sleep at UNA Esperienze in Catania. The front desk staff was friendly, welcoming and helpful. We were upgraded to a suite which was roomy, very clean and with a super comfy bed. The breakfast on the rooftop was worth the additional cost -- great views, attentive service and tasty food. The key cards for the rooms didn't always work, but that was a minor glitch in an otherwise delightful stay.","23627":"I stayed at the Una the first week of September for 7 nights and it was a great place to stay. The hotel is in a great location on one of the main streets, Via Etnea, close to many restaurants, shops, and main attractions.(About a 10 minute walk to the Duomo and 15 minute walk to Catania Centrale train station).  My room was a nice size room for a solo travler. Big king size bed and a nice big bathroom with the bathtub with shower, and a separate shower. The room was extremely clean and housekeeping did a very nice job straightening up the room when I wanted it cleaned.  The breakfast was included with my booking and had a nice variety to choose from. The staff that worked the breakfast shift were always so friendly and politely and helping me with my Italian.  The rest of the staff at the front desk were all extremely helpful especially Rita. I had reached out to the hotel with a few questions a few weeks before I arrived and Rita was extremely responsive and provided me a lot of information. When I arrived at the hotel, Rita was the manager on duty and she welcomed me right away, told me the main sites to see in the city, where they were in location to the hotel, types of tours to take etc. She was very helpful throughout my stay when I had issues with a tour and it made my visit in Catania a lot more pleasant.  I highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Catania.","23628":"Room is adequate, breakfast buffet very good but front desk can use some help. Given wrong directions on two occasions and perhaps there is a language translation issue, but one woman in particular was just plain rude. We prebooked a nonrefundable rate and I get the sense we got a room with the worst view so not sure i recommend doing the same when you book. Roof top is lovely and almost makes up for the sterile reception area. We were pleased with the location.","23630":"As my headline says, nice hotel in great location. But the room service was non existent. They have a leaflet in the room, which gives you a choice of pillows (see photo). Great! So after the first night on latex pillows I asked for a goose down pillow. A chamber made arrived (unfortunately while I was in the bathroom) and delivered a pillow and sort of told my husband off that there was already one in the wardrobe. But both the one she delivered and the one in the wardrobe were clearly latex again. So next morning I told reception that I was still hoping for a down pillow. When we came back in the evening, there was .... none! So I asked reception again, and 20 minutes later a chambermaid finally arrived with a down pillow, but still accused me of ignoring the non existing one in the cupboard. The same evening I realised they had not refilled the minibar with San Pellegrino. So I told reception before dinner to fill it up. When we came back after dinner, guess what? Still no San Pelegrino. I went to the the rooftop bar while my husband stayed in the room. They said they only had big bottles, but would phone room service for (it was very clear between us) San Pellegrino, but what the chamber maid delivered was more still water, I have now 4 bottles of! Really annoying!","23633":"As some people here say, this hotel is perfect for Catania. Rooms were adequate and provide all the amenities as well as a very comfortable to have a well night sleep. Breakfast is fantastic as well. I had breakfast two days at the roof top , and it was worth the experience , as you get a personalized service and dishes not available at the buffet, with views to the Etna. If Antonella (IU think it was her name) attends you, you will feel like home.  You will not regret it if you book this hotel.  Finally this hotel is located next to eveything, restaurants, duomo, roman theather, and if yhou want to do day tours from there, the main station is 15 min by foot or 5 min by bus. Keep in mind that the airport bus stops next to the hotel as well.","23634":"This hotel is centrally located in Catania on the Via Etnea. The good things about the hotel are the ample breakfast, fabulous rooftop bar and staff. Food and drinks on the rooftop are great and not to be missed. The things we didn\u2019t like so much were the very hard bed which was two singles made into a double. This is not comfortable and a tad annoying when you end up in the middle of the bed on the seam. The air conditioner was also very noisy.","23637":"We just returned from our two night stay at this hotel. The location is perfect for exploring Catania. Our guide told us this hotel is one of the best in the city. She was right. The rooftop bar was a great place to regroup every evening. The views were beautiful of the city and Mount Etna. Our room was spacious and very clean. It was very bright with two large windows and well appointed. The bed was very comfortable. Breakfast was the best on our trip. My son had an issue with his room and the hotel responded by providing him an upgrade to a suite. The staff was very helpful and attentive throughout our stay Without doubt I would stay here again and highly recommend it to others.","23639":"If this hotel is within your budget, look no further. We arrived late into the evening, but got a friendly smile at check in. The bedroom and bathroom, was somewhat generic, which we didnt mind as we only intended sleeping in it. (It could have done with a new floor, as is had a kind of plastic timber tile, and it made a ' cracking' noise when you walked over it.) The shower was great.The self service continental breakfast was as substantial as you wanted it to be. We intended using the the al-a-carte breakfast on the 7th floor,on a couple of occasions,and which is available for a cover charge of 15 Euros, but found the self service breakfast more that adequate with a great range of breakfast hot and cold food. The restaurant on the top floor is something else. Beautifully furnished, with outstanding views over the city, and Mt Etna. The food is splendid, excellently served, and although the starters are of a similar cost to the main course, which in my eyes are to expensive, there can be no denying that the food is of the highest quality, and has been prepared to an exacting standard. We found the staff, wherever they were working to be extremely friendly and helpful. The hotel is situated very close to the city centre,and couldnt be a better location. it is impeccably clean, and wonderfully air conditioned. I do however, have one thing to grumble about, there is no literature available to advertise the town amenities, and in particular places of interest, and excursions, and the street map of Catania I had to ask at reception for, was a pretty pathetic photo copy. It is necessary for guests to have the opportunity to see as much as possible, during their stay, and to be able to pick up pamphlets, to plan their holiday is a must. We did however, find a Tourist Information, but they were next to useless, unless they were selling you a 85 euro day trip somewhere. Sort out the pamphlet problem, and this will be a wonderful hotel, for a wonderful holiday.","23642":"Location, rooms, check-in, decor... all top notch. But the service in the restaurant (breakfast was included with our room) was just terrible.The service at breakfast was practically non-existent. We arrived around forty minutes after opening, and it was as though the staff had just walked in and were completely unprepared for service. Our server was nowhere to be found, but yelled out from the kitchen that she would be right out. It took her ten minutes after that to come to our table. Worst of all, she arrived while actively talking on her cell phone. We'd never seen anything like that before! Had a similar experience at the bar the previous night, when after our drinks were served, staff members disappeared. I finally approached the bar and stood there waiting at least 20 minutes to get our bill.Such a shame - stunning restaurant with breathtaking views, and utterly awful service.","23644":"Nice, clean hotel. Great location. Friendly staff. Beautiful rooftop bar & restaurant with the best views. Continental breakfast buffet was good with the best coffee and fresh orange juice. Nice relaxing lobby. Great location right on the main strip of Catania","23647":"Location was central, close to all major attractions, lots of restaurants in close proximity. Hotel reception were excellent and very efficient, we arrived earlier than their check-in time but they managed to get us a room early. Very good with advice and organising transport. Room was a corner room on 2nd floor, good amenities, good storage space. Had a walk-in cupboard but they only gave you 4 jacket hangers and 4 skirt hangers. On a normal business trip, probably plenty. Also, another wardrobe with no hangers. Safe and fridge available, tea coffee facilities. There was noise from outside but what do you expect in a city centre location. Breakfast up on the terrace was a bit of a disaster, felt sorry for the young girl that was serving as she had no assistance. Took 30 minutes to get served and then another 15 minutes to get our order, all the hot and cold food came at once. Hotel need to make more effort if this is one of their main selling points. Breakfast on 1st floor was good , plenty of choice and plenty of seats.","23648":"Amazing hotel at a great location. It has a roof bar where we watched the eruption of Etna on July 27, 2019. The breakfast was decent, the staff was friendly. Lots of stores and restaurants nearby. The old town is also within a walking distance. I highly recommend the hotel if you visit Catania.","23649":"Excellent room and service. Breakfast included also very good. Doesn't look like a hotel from outside. Entrance is following a long corridor but after entrance doors different world. Again excellent. Will not be sorry if you book it","23651":"Supposedly 4* hotel in the town centre! Arrived around 11 pm . Very friendly receptionist checked us in within minutes. However if you expect someone to help you with luggage - don\u2019t ! Check in and check out take care of your self nobody will show you the room or assist you with luggage  The upgraded room is shockingly small - small and simple maybe too simple for my taste. Two beds joined together in such way that is still two separate beds ! Dental kits and other amenities on request only! No complimentary bottled water available in 4* hotel! Ensure you request during time when reception is covered by English speaking staff unless you speak Italian. My wife requested iron and iron board and the reply was that they will deliver but only in the morning despite our attempts to explain that we have business meeting early morning. Bath cleanliness very questionable so are the towels inside and the bedsheets  Breakfast in main restaurant is nice and the choice is ok. The advertised breakfast on the top floor not that much. Top floor has nice terrace with amazing view to Mount Etna however only two staff covering the entire restaurant and their English is very basic to a level that they are not able to understand your order. The idea and design of the place is great, where unfortunately the actual condition and service is disappointment  General conclusion - not that bad hotel and one the the best in Catania however is more of 3* than 4* facility.","23652":"Hello, I stayed in palace catania in July and by the reviews I had expected it to be one of the nicest hotels in catania. Well I sure do hope there\u2019s better because this isn\u2019t it. Check in went smoothly, got to our rooms, everything is okay. Beds are super hard, but that\u2019s fine. The rooms are generic. The only issue I\u2019m talking about is that the staff is insanely slow. Takes way to long for reception to pick up the phone, at breakfast we had to wait 1 hour to even order and we had reservations. Just by looking you can tell the staff is unorganized and slow and has made my experience at palace catania very bitter. It\u2019s one of those hotels that your only paying for the view and the view isn\u2019t that great. If you want to see it maybe visit the hotel? But I don\u2019t recommend anyone staying here and I hope there\u2019s better in catania.","23653":"I spent 2 nights in this hotel with a group of friends. The rooms were really nice and clean and all the staff was very helpful and welcoming as well. The room service food really nice and tasty. We will return for sure.","23654":"Nice hotel in a very busy and popular part of town. Hotel reception very helpful and caring. A real winner. Fabulous roof top restaurant with the best views of Mt Etna. Food, drink and service great but you pay it. Parking is very expensive and if it\u2019s included you have to insist they don\u2019t charge because they will unless you produce evidence on your voucher. All in all, a great place in a nice location","23655":"We loved staying at Palace Catania! After reading some of the reviews we were nervous however very happy with our choice. We booked an executive room with a balcony and received an upgrade to a suite, which was stunning! The bed was extremely comfortable and the room itself was kept very clean with fresh bedding and towels provided daily and the tea, coffee, toiletries and minibar replenished each time! We had breakfast in the rooftop restaurant, which was either continental style or you could order hot food, (we had both!) the views of Etna were stunning! On one of the evenings we ate in the rooftop restaurant again, giving a different view of Etna at night. We opted for the chefs fish taster menu which was plentiful, and couldn\u2019t finish it all, but each dish was as lovely as the last. The service wasn\u2019t the quickest but no slower than other restaurants in Catania, plus we didn\u2019t want rushing through our meal and it\u2019s a lovely place to relax and soak up the atmosphere and the staff were very chatty and friendly. The location is ideal for shopping and day trips plus easily accessible for other bars and restaurants. The only reason we didn\u2019t give this 5 star was that the late night staff were not the most helpful, however providing you ask for anything you need during the day, you\u2019ll be fine! We would absolutely recommend anybody stay at this hotel!","23656":"We were very happy with this hotel, a cool marble Oasis in the middle of a city suffering from benign neglect. The staff are very helpful, both in hotel issues (like bath salts) and with local arrangements. If you have a car drop it at the front on the street and they park it for \u20ac20 night. Breakfast that comes with your room (if booked that way) is on the first floor, a nice room, good food, can squeeze your own juice. Coffee is bitter- an automated espresso machine would be an honor improvement. You can have breakfast in the rooftop restaurant overlooking ETNA but it is not in luded. It's not cheap- don't stay in Catania just to stay here- but if you have to stay in Catania this is a great choice.","23658":"The una palace is one of the best hotels i have ever been in .The location is exactly right on one of the best shopping streets in catania. The staff are the most friendlist and are willing to help with a smile always on their faces .Breakfast was at its finest followed also by our room and the beautiful view on the rooftop of etna .Thanks una palace for a wonderful stay will be back for sure thanks again","23660":"This hotel would easily get a four rating from me if the food, for the tour a mere 25 people, was of half the quality of the roof top restaurant. Overcooked and only one choice. Compare this to the santaphio hotel in Naxos which shows how to do it. Good hotel otherwise and good staff. Very clean and a great roof top bar with great views . Great location plenty of eateries within a very short walk. Supermarkets et al very close.","23661":"I stayed here for 2 nights & booked an executive room in order to eligible to eat breakfast at the rooftop terrace.  My room (#207) was very big & spacious but unlike the impressive photos in Booking.com it was disappointing in terms of old facilities.  The bed was very uncomfortable, the air conditioning was not working properly & though i complained twice, it didn\u2019t help. That was big issue for me as it was hot.  The bathroom had unpleasant odor and maybe because it looks old, the shower seemed like unclean.  My first breakfast was on the rooftop terrace- a lacarte, and it was very disappointing for someone like me that used to eat full breakfast every day. There was not much served to my table and i was hungry. The other day i went to eat breakfast at the regular dining room which had a sufficient selection & was much much better- no view like the terrace but i could eat full breakfast.  An evening before i left, i was told by the reception that i can stay 1 extra hour after checkout but on the day of departure, i got a call from the reception that i have to clear the room. When I explained the above, the gentleman told me that it was not updated in the computer.  I had a feeling that the staff was nice & attentive but in fact they were all just smiling but didnt take care of my requests regarding the air condition and the late check out.  Very disappointing to waste 220 euro for one night and not getting money value.  It\u2019s my second time experience with UNA hotels in italy and now I know i will not reserve it anymore","23662":"Stayed for 3 nights as part of Titan Tours trip Centrally situated hotel and ideal for exploring Catania with good view of Mt Etna Nice room - very clean with good facilities Excellent breakfast but not so excellent evening meal with tinned vegetables and unappetising meat fish This apart we enjoyed our stay in this hotel","23663":"Stayed here for 3 nights on our  Jewel of the Mediterranean  tour by Titan Travel from the UK.  A quite convenient location and a well appointed hotel : clean, comfortable and welcoming. Excelllent buffet breakfast. Nice view of Mt. Etna from roof terrace, particularly early in the morning when much less cloud on the volcanoe and in the evening at sunset. Had a few drinks at the roof bar but did not dine there as it was somewhat pricy.","23666":"This is a great hotel in the centre of town with largish rooms, staff friendly and the hotel is really good with a good breakfast. Walk out of your hotel and you are right in the middle of town.We enjoyed our stay and would definitely recommend","23667":"We were in Sicily for a week early may for a bike ride. Palace Catania was our starting point, we stayed there 2 nights to get rid of jet lag. The welcoming was warm. The hotel and our room was super clean. Breakfast is simply top of the line with a very large choice buffet style. You can order also. Coffee is just yuppy.... The hotel is very well situated. Dot miss university of Catania botanical gardens 20 minutes walk...","23669":"It is the end of May in Sicily, we are at the heart of Catania, one of Italy\u2018s most famous gastronomic cities. The local markets are abound with strawberries, cherries and other lovely fresh produce from the region. And yet breakfast at the pricy UNA Palace is sad and sadistically mediocre. As a fruit eater, you wake up to find no more than pale bowls of bland pineapple and tasteless melon, the standard handy stuff that hotel managers can store for days and present to a crowd anytime at short notice. You wander incredulously around the breakfast room, asking where is that lovely Sicilian ricotta that sells EUR 4,80 a kilo at the local market, just yards away? Nowhere, because at the UNA Palace they will rather treat you to industrial yoghurt that comes in two or three artificial flavours a pack, if you know what I mean. I could go on and comment on the disappointing cheeses and pastries but I will stop here. They will tell you at the NB that if you wish to have a \u201eSicilian breakfast\u201c you need to please top up your spicy rate with EUR 12,00 more and move to another dining room.","23670":"I stayed here for two nights before going on a cycling trip. The staff were wonderful, the location great - centrally located and close to shops and restaurants. Breakfast buffet was excellent and they also have a very good roof top restaurant with a great view. They have a small spa, but adequate. They arranged a great tour to Mt. Etna at the last minute. Good value for money.","23673":"Spent 3 nights here. Nice hotel. Comfortable rooms. Lovely rooftop bar with great views of Mount Etna. Excellent breakfast buffet. Delightful staff and top service. Great central location. What more could you want?","23676":"We loved staying at Quattro Canti suits. Luca, our host was incredibly friendly, and made all of our wish come true. The apartements are very nice and fashionable, with great views from the balcony to the streetlife.","23679":"We loved this modern boutique hotel. The room was a great size and the bed was very comfortable. The hotel is located just two blocks from the Duomo and elephant statue. Luca was easy to work with, very helpful and cheery.  Next time we\u2019re in Catania we will be staying here again.","23685":"This isn\u2019t a hotel but rather 4 or 5 rooms tucked away behind a building. As a result, there are no windows which we didn\u2019t love. And you do need to be able to walk up stairs to enter so not handicap friendly. But it\u2019s SO quiet and the room was really nice. The best part was the host Luca. He was very helpful and accommodating!","23686":"We came here on our way back home \u2013 unfortunately only for a short stop-over. The place is amazing like other guests said before. Rooms are perfectly equipped, nicely decorated, the location is in the heart of the town and Luca is such a friendly and open hearted host who can't be better and so on and on... We enjoyed it so much and wished deeply we could have stayed longer with more time! So this is a very strong recommendation for Quattro Canti if ever be in Catania.","23687":"I was very pleased with Quattro Canti. The location is amazing - right in the centre of the old city, very close to the duomo etc but whisper quiet. The room I had was modest in size but very modern, clean and comfortable with a good size shower by Italian standards, luxury toiletries, Netflix an good wifi. Luca, the owner, was lovely and very helpful.","23690":"We were recommended by a friend to stay at Quattro Canti Suites and we can\u2019t thank her enough (Electlifestyle)! The boutique style hotel is beautifully decorated down to every detail and the service was top notch. We stayed in a breathtaking junior suite with a balcony to the Main Street. Even though the hotel is in the center of town (walking distance to most sites and restaurants!!!) it is still peaceful and quiet. Not only was it enjoyable, the service was excellent as well. Luca was more than helpful in helping us during our stay and recommended restaurants and sites to visit. We made a new friend in Catania and we can\u2019t wait to come back!!!","23693":"We came to Catania for a friends wedding and I chose the suites because they looked so beautifully designed. Before arriving Luca the owner made contact to find out our time of arrival, right from that first contact he was fantastic, he couldn't have been more helpful. It was apparent that he genuinely enjoyed meeting and chatting to his guests and was utterly enthusiastic about making sure that we experienced the best his city had to offer. There are four beautiful suites located in a first floor apartment with a small entrance hallway and reception area and from the minute you come up the stairs from the typical Italian entrance lobby you can see the quality. Everything is finished to a very high standard, bathroom included. Lovely balcony overlooking the main crossroads onto Via Etnea, fascinating to watch the chaotic traffic right outside. Definitely having Luca as our host made the city visit more special. Breakfast served on a tray in your room, including a little candle was an added touch of luxury. Great place to stay, grazie mille per tutto Luca.","23694":"Quattro Canti Suits couldn't be more central. Located in Quattro Canti, a cross between Via Etnea and the road that goes up to the Monastery, you get to easily walk to all major monuments and restaurants.  Luca has done a fantastic job of renovating an old building and transforming the apartment and the rooms into a little corner of paradise. The rooms are nicely decorated and with breakfast in bed we got to enjoy most of it.  We will definitely be back here for our next trip!","23698":"Having had a delayed flight land into Catania airport, we arrived late to Catania Quattro Suites, at around 10PM in the evening. I had already spoken to Luca (the owner) and was keeping him updated via IM on my phone as we were arriving unusually late. We arrived late into Catania Airport, and after collecting our bags our prebooked transfer picked us up and took us to the hotel. The transfer took around 30 minutes due to traffic in the evening.  The entrance itself is on a busy main road, it is a large wooden door with a buzzer and keypad outside. I text Luca and he said to press the buzzer to let us up. The door opened and we walked into a marble floor entrance to the building, followed the steps up to the outdoor hallway, and across to the private Catania Quattro Canti Suites entrance. Again, there was a buzzer and a keypad, we buzzed the door and Luca let us. Inside this door is the main reception and hallway internally leading to the four suites. Luca scanned our passports, checked us in, gave us our room key and showed us to the suite. We booked the Honeymoon Luxury Suite which is nearly double the price of the other 3 rooms but it is very much worth it.  Inside the room the decor is plush, and the detail is amazing. The Honeymoon Luxury Suite is definitely draped in luxury, and has got to be the best room in Catania! The room has a 65 inch Sony 4k TV, a Nespresso coffee machine, soft drinks, water and snacks in the minibar, and an amazing walk-in shower. Every morning Luca brings freshly baked croissants including Pistachio, Almond, and Nutella, all locally made and sourced. Fresh coffee and fruit on request.  Location wise the suite is perfect, it is right next to Via Etnea (the main tourist road in Catania) and is close enough to all tourist spots, restaurants and cafe's that are in the North, South, and West of the city centre. Getting around is easy enough on foot with most attractions and food joints within a max 15-minute walk in any direction.  The best part of this wonderful guestroom is the owner, Luca, and his beautiful wife. Every morning Luca would greet us with the beautifully prepared breakfast. He does not stay at the guesthouse so it is not manned 24 hours a day, but instead, he lives nearby and so he will pop in during the morning to arrange the breakfast, after which his wife takes over and the cleaner clears out the room, and then you might catch him again in the afternoon. He leaves his contact details, all access codes for doors etc. and recommendations for nearby restaurants in the room so you are never really ever feel like you are alone. And with there only being 4 rooms in the guesthouse, it all feels very intimate and cosy, with a real personal service that only Luca can deliver so well with his wonderful charisma and smile. And anything we need, absolutely anything - Luca will go out of his way to arrange for us. He is very helpful and cares wonderfully for his guests.  I booked the room with Expedia but was concerned that the internet speed would not be very good given that my wife and I would need to work whilst we stayed there. I emailed the hotel after booking but having not gotten a reply I contacted Expedia. I also rang the number on the website a few times but nobody answered as I wanted to confirm a late check in as our flight was due to land at 8.30PM. A couple of days later Expedia came back to me to confirm that they had spoken to Luca about both the internet speed and the late check-in. I then immediately rang the hotel and spoke to Luca who reassured me everything was good to go, and he kindly gave me his mobile phone number to keep in touch with him. On reflection, I was a little worried as I had not been able to get in touch with them, and the lack of communication worried me, but in hindsight this could have easily been alleviated if Expedia had provided a different contact number to me after the booking.  So all in all, my wife and I spent 1 week working remotely from the wonderful Catania Quattro Canti Suites, and we would highly recommend you visit. It is a wonderful guesthouse with a wonderful owner, in a perfect location, luscious rooms, beautiful decor and one of the greatest guesthouses we have ever stayed.","23701":"Well terrible service from the hotel with regards to cancellation due to a change is circumstances at home, changed to flights with easyJet no problem had to cancel the hotel they had txt me so I txt back saying me and wife (my wife\u2019s 50th) will not be coming to stay and no reply so I thought that was that and then they took the money out of my account. So I have contacted them and they have informed me they need three days notice which I can\u2019t anywhere in the web site I booked it on. They did offer a voucher with a time limit on it which is of no use to me. I rung up booking.com and after one hour what a waste of time that was they keep asking for a PIN number which they had never sent me. So after losing \u00a3700 with no information from the hotel I am not happy to say the least","23758":"This is a good choice for an overnight stop while visiting the Valley of the Temples. It\u2019s a secure, gated property on a hillside, a short drive from gate 1 (Temple of Juno entrance) and the museum. Oddly, when I wrote ahead of time asking for directions, they replied that they would send the morning of our arrival (which they didn\u2019t do). Why not just answer the question when asked? It seems at odds with the generally pleasant and accommodating service here. We found our way, after a wrong step at the roundabout that caused us to do a full circuit around the temples and back again. We were given a warm welcome and a cold granita.  The property is very clean, new and modern, all white and glass. There\u2019s a main building with rooms, restaurant and pool, and below that a row of rooms facing out over the valley, looking at the Temple of Juno on the next hilltop, each with a small private pool. You can specify in your reservation that you want the pool heated (at extra cost), it is still pretty cold (max 31 Celsius) but refreshing after an afternoon in the heat. The walls along the sides provide privacy from your neighbors, though sadly not soundproofing \u2013 we were unlucky to have a very loud family next door, so it wasn\u2019t quite as peaceful as it otherwise could be.  The room was comfortable, with good lighting and a comfortable bed, but hard pillows. The closet has only short hang space, very high up, with a tool to get hangers up and down, plus shelves and drawers. The bathroom has a good shower (rain shower + handheld + wall jets), and drawer space for toiletries. They didn\u2019t warn us not to drink the tap water until I asked, nor did they provide bottled water, which I found was not uncommon in Sicily.  There is a nice restaurant onsite, with the same menu for lunch and dinner. Breakfast is an extensive buffet, more choices than we've seen elsewhere-six or eight types of juice, fruit, caprese salad, bruschetta, meats and cheeses, scrambled and hard boiled eggs, sausage and bacon, breads with a dozen different spreads, pancakes, more than a dozen different tortes, little cannoli and almond tarts, cookies, and a juicer where you can make your own fresh concoction from fruits and vegetables. If all that isn't enough, you can buy other hot dishes - frittata, omelette, etc. Very good food!","23762":"Enjoy a lemon granita as soon as you arrive at the front desk. That's after a cart welcomes your car to carry your bags. I cannot say enough about the staff hospitality. Salvatore and Patrizia couldn't have been more helpful. View of the Temple Juno should be from every room. Confirm this before you book. Our wing of rooms also had a personal pool two feet from the patio door. Nice surprise, though we didn't get a chance to use it. The hotel is a 10 minute drive to both Via Atenea, the main town stretch, and also 10 minutes to Valley of the Temples, therefore a convenient location. There is a very large breakfast spread-look for the pancake with pistachio cream!","23763":"Ultra modern hotel situated in a hillside setting some distance from any facilities. Thats great in many respects, but it does mean that you have to eat here, unless you are prepared to drive. The rooms are small but well appointed. My party of four all had rooms with private swimming pools -top tip, dont pay extra for the heated pool, the difference is significant but the difference in temperature seemed hardly noticeable. The food in the restaurant was excellent, but certainly not cheap, although the staff were first class and very helpful. The main pool and gardens were excellent, albeit the internal meeting areas were restricted. Would have given it 5* but they completely cocked up my booking for 4 rooms, resulting in me having to move out for one night and stay in another hotel some distance away!","23766":"We wished we had stayed longer here as we only had one night. Everything about the Hotel was very good, especially the food which not cheap was excellent quality. Wonderful breakfast and one of the few hotels that supplied good fresh fruit.  Marvellous views and a super swimming pool.","23768":"We stayed at the Doric Bed Hotel for two nights during our tour of Western Sicily. The hotel is located in an excellent location very close to the Valley of the Temples and with a lovely view across to the Temple of Juno. The staff were delightful. Our room was small but comfortable. The bathroom was rather too compact - especially the shower. The food was delicious - great use of local ingredients and fresh herbs. We also enjoyed the lovely pool - very refreshing after a hard day's sightseeing. Thoroughly recommend.","23769":"We recently stayed at the Doric Bed hotel during a road trip of Italy. Especially for the price, the hotel checked all of the boxes and we were very happy with our stay. Because it is not in the centro region of Agriento, finding the hotel and parking is a breeze. The staff at check in was very helpful and the granita was a nice touch on a hot day. We stayed in their standard rooms which were clean and comfortable once the AC kicked it (bit warm when we first got there). The pool wasn't anything too fancy but was nice for a refreshing dip after a hot day walking around the temples. Didn't have dinner here but breakfast was quite good with a number of different sweets ( I think I had slices of 4-5 different torts). Staff was very helpful at check in and check out with our bags. All in all, one of the nicer places we stayed during our trip- not too posh but very comfortable and friendly staff made it nice for us","23771":"The Doric Bed Boutique Hotel is quirky in a good way! The hotel is located a few miles from the archeological site on a dramatic, windswept hillside. It\u2019s easy to get to and from the site and easy to park at the hotel, unlike hotels in town.  It has a modern design and hip furnishings. The \u201clobby\u201d is a glass box with views to the temples. The hotel restaurant is very good and you will not feel the need to go out for dinner, even if you spend more than one night there. The breakfasts are wonderful, especially if you like Italian pastries.  There are a variety of room types.We stayed in the economy room which spacious but didn\u2019t have a window, only a skylight. It wasn\u2019t too bad and the price was right. Recommended.","23772":"We can not fault this hotel We did not find fault with anything The rooms were modern and bright The breakfasts were out of this world The staff were pleasant and nothing was to much The views were amazing did not wa to leave Thanks again","23775":"We booked this hotel for our stay in the Agrigento area as it seemed good value and was located in a rural area offering peace and quiet. We were not disappointed in any way. Add to that the delicious food served in the restaurant, the views of The Valley of the Temples and the fabulous staff & comfortable, sleek rooms with balconies and views and you would be hard pushed to better your experience. The hotel also has rooms with private swimming pools which may suit the more active and or romantic","23796":"This wonderful gem really is a showcase of the best of Sicily in all aspects. A modern yet ecologically-conscious establishment about 5 km from the stunning Valle dei Templi, the entire hotel is perched on a slope so as to afford views of the Temple of Juno. The grounds are landscaped and immaculately clean and well-maintained and the rooms are smart and contemporary.  The restaurant is not open to the public: it is for the exclusive use of hotel guests and it offers a true gastronomic experience. Food is clearly fresh, locally sourced where possible, and offers a great selection highlighting local specialties.  The staff at the Doric are without exception welcoming, gracious and professional. We recieved a message the day before our arrival confirming the details of our stay and were asked if we required any assistance. Our arrival was seamless and we were checked in effortlessly. The restaurant staff also are gracious and clearly trained to very high standards. Within a day they engaged us in cordial conversation and yet were still professional with their recommendations.  We stayed in many hotels on our recent trip of Sicily, and the Doric really stood out as a showcase of the best that Sicily has to offer in every respect, and we recommend it without hesitation to anyone staying in the area. Stay and visit the Valle dei Templi and Agrigento, and if you can, stay an extra night or two and enjoy the hotel experience.","23800":"We had a 1 night stay at the Doric Bed Hotel as we were in the area to see the temples.  We booked one of the rooms with a private plunge pool which have uninterrupted views across the valley with the bonus of one of the main Temples.  The Doric Bed is a purpose built (new) complex in a rural setting. A couple of miles to the entrance of the Temples and about 5kms to the centre of Agrigento.  As other reviews have pointed out, the staff are wonderful. We had such a warm welcome which included granita, which was a lovely touch.  The hotel grounds are made up of a number of small buildings, reception, restaurant, the rooms, with the beginnings of what will become beautiful gardens over time. The complex is planned to make the best of the views over the valley and sea, so I think where ever you are you get that bonus.  The rooms are modern (if not a little small). I wasn't totally convinced that the private pool was a complete success but it offered a unique addition.  We had dinner at the on site restaurant, which we loved. The manager (who also runs a cookery school), gave a demonstration of pasta making during dinner - I know that may sound odd but she had such charisma that it was a great success. The food was fresh, beautifully presented and tasted great. I'd recommend dinner there, not least because you're saved the effort of driving anywhere else.  Breakfast as other reviews have said was very good. Not sure that I'd have the industrial sized Nutella vat or Flump Dispenser but they made me laugh.  A good choice for visiting the Temples.","23802":"The view from the reception building, dining room, and our room of the mountains and ancient temple were stunning. The gardens were charming. The entire place was clean and crisp. The young staff was all helpful, friendly, and seemingly happy. The food was excellent. There\u2019s also plenty of parking. I\u2019d recommend this place wholeheartedly.","23804":"I confirm that the Doric Bed can count as a boutique hotel as everything is stylish designed in a young and modern way. Our room was cosy but a bit small. However, the valley view and buffet breakfast were fantastic. The hosts are very nice and did a cooking lesson how to make fresh local pasta which inspired our good dinner evening. The wifi was very good and stable. All in all great value for money.","23805":"A stunning view of one of the temples and a few minutes away from the famous Valley of Temples of Agrigento, takes 10 minutes by car. The experience could be further enhanced by a shuttle to and from the hotel, as opposed to running a golf-cart within a small piece of dry land. The vegetation surrounding the premises could be improved.  This is a small family run hotel. Boutique and Relais are two terms that would not come to my mind. It is new and pointing in the right direction, there is still a lot to achieve in terms of fine-tuning the place before charging what they charge. In other words, it is way overpriced for what you get in return.  By far the best is the breakfast buffet which offers a lot of locally produced food, ricotta cheese, pistachio spread and home backed cakes. Amazing, including fresh orange juice, good coffee and much more. On the downside, the rooms are small, finishing and character needs a lot of work, toiletries offered are a low 2-star motel quality. The rooms in the main building are very noisy. The rooms with private pool offer little or no privacy from the neighbours, could use some plants or light curtains to screen the outdoor area. This goes for the SPA as well.  The food served at dinner is average and overpriced and in contrast with breakfast. We ordered \u2018spaghetti vongole\u2019, and there were literally 8 mussels (vongole) for 15 Euros. The owner recognized this was embarrassing and took it off the final bill.  Overall the intensions are good, but there is a lot of space for improvement before moving to 4 stars or claiming tags such as \u2018boutique\u2019 or \u2018relais\u2019.","23814":"We stayed 3 nights at this lovely hotel. The owner and host, Fiorella, kept in touch with us for our arrival time so that she could greet us with delicious fruit and a 1 2 bottle of Prosecco. The decor of I Segreti is modern but wam and inviting. She thought of everything, including a small coffee maker in the room. Breakfasts were copious, with homemade panna cotta, bread and jams, ham and cheese, and even cannoli. Although it is on a somewhat busy road, the shutters to the rooms block out a great deal of the traffic sound. I was not really bothered at all. The hotel is conveniently located about 1 km from the entrance to the Valle dei Templi. The sidewalk disappears in a couple of places, so you get to share the road with the motorists! We loved staying here, not only because of the convenient location, but because of Fiorella\u2019s outstanding hospitality. Grazie mille, Fiorella!","23816":"Fiorella is an excellent host. The place is very modern, clean and has a wonderful ambience. We were welcomed with a small bottle of champagne in our room on arrival. Breakfast was excellent. We stayed in Artemide (Artemis) which had a comfy bed, nice bathroom and a large balcony with sea view.  Yes, the hotel is located on a main road but this didn't put us off in the slightest, we spent every night out on the balcony enjoying a drink. As soon as the door is closed the noise from the road is completed gone.  The valley of the temples is a short walk down the hill, and if you're feeling up to it Agrigento centre is a 20 minute walk up hill.  We will definitely visit again!","23822":"The property is well located - walking distance to the Temples and they provide free parking. The owner and staff are very nice and they provide a number of very nice special touches like homemade items. But the property is on a busy road and there is noise from the vehicle traffic.","23828":"So many wonderful reasons to love this place. We really appreciated our balcony, with views towards the ruins. Loved the Nespresso machine in our room. There is a nice restaurant just around the corner for dinner (see my separate review), and the breakfasts were just divine! Very substantial and a delight to try some R\u00e9gional specialities (baked goods). The staff were all just wonderful. Can\u2019t recommend it highly enough!","23838":"Delightfully decorated and nicely equipped including a coffee making machine. Relatively easy to find with good parking outside. You do not need to pay the parking attendant who appears to be charging people for what is a free parking lot. There are 4 or 5 immaculate rooms. The owner is delightful and helpful with recommendations for restaurants for the evening. Breakfast the following day was excellent. There is some slight road noise at night but if you close the security shutters this mostly goes away.","23841":"We'd had a bad day and arriving here was heaven! Complimentary glass of prose co, water and a bowl of cherries! Gena was lovely and explained everything in our spacious room - even had English Speaking to , slippers, coffee, tea and breakfast was also very good . The bed was excellent and I had an amazing sleep! She recommended a restaurant in the old town upi the hill ( which is definitely worth a visit) but we thought that This did not offer value for money - two dishes we ordered they advised were not available - they suggested other options in lieu of and when we got the bill they were significantly more expensive! I think eat locally and it would be a more authetic experince! Highly recommend this b&b - exceptionally well run!","23842":"The positive reviews are all accurate. This is sleek, modern, immaculate and fun. The rooms are large with clever built ins. White walls and modern art. Great bed and high quality linens. Cool shower (photo).  However, there are no comfortable chairs! Only place to sit is the breakfast room. And our room did not have a balcony, tho I didn\u2019t really mind as it would be over a busy road.  So overlook the fact that this is essentially over a commercial strip mall and that the parking lot is ratty (hey, the parking is ample and free!) and enjoy the comforts.","23845":"Immaculate clean, newly furbished and with GREAT decoration taste, these are not necessarily things which one would expect from a B&B located on the side of the road. What surprised me the most was the attention which the owner gave to all details, so that basically we had amenities which you usually get only in more expensive hotels, and definitely not in all of them... As a welcome treat we received a small bottle of prosecco, two sweet local treats and a bowl with fresh mandarins (from our own tree, as the owner said). Two bottles of water in the mini bar were also free. They also offered room slippers, plus that we had in the room a small coffee machine + capsules, and a kettle and some tea bags. Hair drier in the bathroom, nice selection of cosmetics, even a safe box for the valuables was available. Wifi was great, quality of the mattress the same, extra pillow available. The breakfast was typical Italian, but again with a touch of class...panacotta with fresh strawberry sauce (made by the owner) and excellent canolli (recommended as freschissimi by the young girl which was serving us). We didn't have problems with the noise, even if our room faced the street (closed shutters were enough). All in all, this is a great example of hospitality, which can be offered anywhere and for a reasonable price. Complimenti!","23848":"I segreti Della Valle was a great B And B. The host owner couldn't have been more helpful and charming. Extremely clean and updated sorroundings , close to all major attractions. Would definitely recommend to friends.","23886":"Check in easily and quickly done. There is a lift what is important for us with heavy luggage. We received a plate with fruit soon we got in the room. The room is reasonable size with fridge, comfortable bed, air conditioner heat system and good wi fi. Location is good when you have a car and they have a free parking. Breakfast is good and no many variety but a suggestion to have a glass cup instead disposable ones. Overall good value for the money and I recommend it.","23948":"I was travelling in Sicily for three days and spent here just one night. While the interior -panelling, foyer, room doors- looked new, once in our chamber things went worse: AC didn\u2019t obbey our orders but a distant mastermind\u2019s, beds ridiculously small, deficient cleanliness. One hanger for two bath towels? Morning buffet just mediocre. It is true the hotel is close to the justly famous Valley of the Temples, the caveat being its location in a half developed area with barely any restaurants or services. The staff was OK but all in all one gets the impression that the place has known better days.","23968":"Our visit here was sadly a bit of a rush - we arrived too late to use the pool and had to leave for the airport and rush through breakfast. What we saw though was gorgeous. Beautiful old house (with some problematic fittings - taps, a c etc ..) in stunning surrounds. Super friendly welcome and a very tasty breakfast. Great base an hour from Catania in the middle of the island for those who wish to explore and return to idyllic surrounds. the A c units ... which i always need in Sicily in July are very noisy if you want it on overnight. You pay for the charm as oppose to the mod cons.","23971":"We booked this wonderfull place since it is situated in the middle of Sicily and made it possible to cover the island's long distances in a comfortable way. We have been here since last Friday and we're going home this comming Saturday accomplishing an 8 nights sejour This is the perfect place for these wiiling to be in a cosy environment, enjoy a warm hospitality and a breathtaking landscape. Let me quote mr. Schwarzenneger and say:  I'll be back!!!","23972":"The interior design of this place is very unique, and outside you get great countryside views, peace and tranquility, with close proximity to Enna. Breakfast was generous and diverse, the beds were comfy, and the staff is super friendly and helpful. However, the setup of the place in weird. We stayed on the 2nd floor, reached by a very narrow staircase that makes lifting suitcases a bit challenging. The bathroom is outside the main room, and an open flight of stair connecting it to the room, quite a peculiar and a bit unnerving setup. The hot water stream in the shower was a touch and go, and the towels were like sandpaper... And no TVs in the rooms. Bottom line - A very nice place, but I'd expect a bit more for the price...","23975":"This B&B is very well managed! The room was so spacious that the feeling was that we were in a studio! The decoration is relaxing and beautiful at the same time! Amazing view, nice pool and a fantastic breakfast! Well done to all the team!","23976":"A lot of thought has gone into the design of this pretty and peaceful B&B. Our room was light, airy and spacious, with everything we needed to hand. We were very warmly welcomed and looked after throughout our stay. There was lots to choose from at breakfast (fresh fruits, eggs, cheese, meat, breads, biscuits, croissants plus good coffee). We were only there for 2 nights but it would make an excellent base for a longer stay because of the central location.","23977":"This is a very laid back and homely place to stay. Amazing value for money. We stayed 2 nights and would loved to have stayed longer. The pool was great. Really couldn't fault it except for maybe the distant barking dogs!","23996":"This is a small old stone house that has been thoroughly modernized inside with whimsical decor. We were in the family room in a second house on the property. It was 2 spacious and comfortable rooms. One room had a king size bed and the second room had enough beds to accommodate 3-4 kids. The rooms look over picturesque fields and some of the largest most beautiful cypress trees I have ever seen. Emiliano, who speaks English, greeted us and gave useful suggestions. The breakfast is bountiful, fresh and delicious. And they happily provided us with a water kettle so we could make tea or coffee in the room. The only drawback is that there is not a comfortable lounge area to sit if it is chilly or dark outside. The common area in the main house is right outside the guest rooms and has visually interesting but not comfortable seating.The location of the property is great, an easy drive to Piazza Armerina and the Villa, which should not be missed. In the small town of Pergusa, 5 mins drive, are several good dining spots, especially Le Carrettina, delicious.","23997":"This was such a pleasant place to stay--quiet and peaceful in the country. We did not have a chance to use the pool, but the location is perfect. Breakfast was very filling, and the best part was the cactus fruit--called Indian figs by the locals. Service is helpful and friendly.  Highly recommended.","24019":"Bed and breakfast: very nice rooms, quiet setting, beautiful site, good breakfast. Very thoughtful service. Clean swimming pool - nothing left to desire. The landlady helps with all your sightseeing plans. Located in an opulent countryside, within easy driving distance to the north, South and western coast.","24060":"Il Cortiletto is very different, it has a huge amount of character. Very enjoyable.","24167":"We loved our one night stay here and recommend it as a really friendly little place suitable for a short stay. It is outside Trapani but right on the seashore in Marausa with incredibly lovely views over the Egadi Islands. We saw a wonderful sunset over Favignana. The bedroom was basic, but clean and had everything we needed including a small refridgerator. The family run business is really welcoming and the food excellent. we had lunch outside right on the edge of the sea and dinner in the friendly dining room with several local people. We would definitely stay here again.","24244":"Well-placed, clean, comfortable, well-priced and with a very helpful owner. It was also warm in enough in mid-March. Sicily is fine to visit also in late winter-early spring. I would love to come back. Very much recommended. Really impeccable!","24381":"As we arrived, we liked that there is parking at the boulevard in front of the B&B. The place is inside a historical building, interior courtyard and well preserved floor tiles. Rosa was a great host, very warm and friendly. The room is lovely and good bed. Very hot water for shower. We were just between funivia for Erice and the Port area, good location. Price was fine.  We know it is typical in the area and quality was ok , but it was not easy to start the day with sweets, sugar blast early and no protein. We carried baggage since there is no elevator, but the historical building is really great.","24392":"The B&B is istuated on the 3rd floor of a very nice old building. there's no elevator (so keep that in mind if your travellng with heavy luggage). The rooms have high ceilingss, beautiful beds and are nicely furnished. Some of the rooms window directs to the busy main road, so it's impossible to keep it open during the night if you're a light sleeper. The breakfast was ok, but not great (i.e. hot water for tea was never hot. If you're not into sweets there's almost nothing left to eat for breakfast). What we ddn't like is that we saw the woman running this B&B only once for a minute. The other times there was either no one or one of the daughters who barely speak any English.  Be aware that you can only pay with cash (no credit card!).","24436":"We stayed only one night at the Renda Appartamenti. The host were very nice and welcoming. The apartment well located (not far from central station and buses), clean and with all necessary features. Price afordable for the area.","24462":"There were three of us and we stayed here for one night. Our apartment was located on Via Leonardo Orlandini. It was a block away from the beach and a block away from the carabinieri station.We had a two bedroom apartment. I'd say more like 1 1 2 bedroom as the second bedroom was a very small single room. Though the single room was small, everything was nice, clean, and it had air conditioning. The only thing I didn't care for was that you had to go through the small bedroom to get to the bathroom. There were doors off of both bedrooms that lead to the balcony. Mr. Renda is awesome and speaks very little English. As we were getting ready to grab a bite to eat, he was checking in another tenant. We asked for a recommendation, and of course he recommended his restaurant (he also has a food and wine store). We were not disappointed. I would definitely stay here again.","24463":"I stayed at Renda Appartamenti twice during my trip. Rooms are very clean and well equiped. You can find everything you need. The owners are very helpful although they don't speak English :)","24464":"Stayed at Apartamenti Renda in July and this was the nicest place so far. The owner is wonderful. She makes sure you are happy. The apartment was spacious, super clean, and the location was great. We were minutes away from the port, Erice. shops etc. And we can't forget her Salmuneria downstairs. Amazing shop; fresh cold cuts, paninis Yum!! We will definately go back.  Familglia del Canada","24617":"Abita appartments: unique, quality, spacious, original and a good staff. We enjoyed it very much. Parking for your car 500 metres away in a free-zone. Central Trapani. Breakfast: Top. Conclusion: good choice.","24701":"This place is like a little jewel! We were informed that it just opened in June 2016, totally new, clean, perfectly decorated, with all the conforts that one might need for a ideal stay. The owner is very nice and made us feel like home, always ready to help us with tips on things to do around. Situated in a residential, quiet area, only 5 min from the historic center of Trapani with very easy access to the main roads that to go to Erice , San vito lo capo etc.. To recommend 100%!","24720":"Stayed here on vacation with 2 other family members. Easy to find Agriturismo location. Very quiet possible because it was off season. Room was clean & neat. Ordered the Half Board when booking my reservation. The dinners were fantastic just like a Michelin Star restaurant. It's a set menu for the night. No selection, but everything was delicious & elegantly presented. Breakfast was adequate for Europe. Everyone was very nice to deal with. Would not hesitate to stay here again.","24721":"We had only one night at this location but it was a great stay. The Tower House is superb, we had a warm welcome from Nina and we had a nice dinner with Enzo. The own produced Olive oil is fantastic by side of own flour, pasta, ...","24734":"We had a lovely four-night stay here during our honeymoon, in the highest room in the tower. The views from our little balcony were lovely! The decoration of the room was rustic, but charming and it was perfectly clean. One of the main reasons we chose to stay here was that they offer a vegan menu in the restaurant in the evening. They did not disappoint, offering us a delicious three-course vegan meals with wine and a liqueur of the local fichi d'india (prickly pears) as a digestif. They also offered us a fantastic vegan breakfast every day, including cornetti, soya yoghurts and a selection of cakes and jams. The family were so friendly and welcoming to us, including their adorable (and very sleepy) dogs! On our final day, they arranged a cooking lesson for us. We made busiate pasta and pesto trapanese from scratch with the sweet Sicilian chef - it was one of the highlights of our whole holiday. Couldn't recommend Agriturismo Fratelli Sanacore enough.","24752":"We were three couples spending one night here as we travelled across Sicily and I'm sorry to say that this was our one disappointing experience on this holiday. We had originally booked three tower rooms because based on reviews here, it was clear that these were preferred rooms. Shortly before we arrived, the owner contacted us to say that we could only have two tower rooms and the third room would be in the courtyard. Awkward. It turned out that the courtyard room was a large family room with three beds in it, but the beds were of poor quality, the linens were old and threadbare, and the towels were practically stiff, they were so rough. Enzo was pleasant enough but there was very little information about the operation, maybe because he was very busy, checking us in, cooking the dinner that night and organizing the breakfast the next day. Dinner was ok - the starters, a shrimp risotto and fried calamari, were good; better than the main course of fish and potatoes, which was very bland and white, with no vegetables. We thought maybe our server would talk to us about the products from the agritourismo, but she was very dour and not talkative. On the plus side, we loved spending time in the lovely courtyard - we had drinks out there when we arrived and we had breakfast there the next morning. And the breakfast was a big surprise - we had seen the palstic cereal dispensers the day before and were expecting the worst, but they set out a very nice selection of breads, baked goods, fruit, cheeses, meat. And Enzo made us great cappucinos whenever we asked. So there are some positives here, they just need to build on them and improve the rooms and the agritourismo experience.","24807":"When traveling through Sicily you'll find many opportunities to stay at B & B locations. This particular location is about 20 minutes away from Trapani. Which isn't that far of a drive. Just make sure you time your visit to the city correctly or you'll be driving into a ghost town. Most shops and restaurants close between 2 and 3pm.  This location is well established. They have several rooms plus a restaurant. It's a pretty big operation. It feels more like a motel and less of a quiet B & B. The pool area is very nice. When we checked in we were told the pool closes at 7pm which seemed like an odd time considering we were in the middle of no where and the pool wasn't even near any of the rooms. Then I realized why this early closing was happening. The staff was setting up for a private party next to the pool. That is never a good feeling especially when you are a guest and you booked a room to enjoy the pool.  The mattress was probably the softest mattress in all of Sicily. It was a nice change from sleeping on rock hard mattresses. The air conditioner in our room wasn't working very good. I had to mess with the controller a lot until I finally got it blowing some cool air. There were also a lot of flies in our room. I had to kill a bunch of them myself. It was really annoying. I'm not sure how that can be fixed but it was not enjoyable. In our three week stay traveling around Sicily this was the only place we encountered a fly issue.  We had dinner in the restaurant. It's a great view for sunset. The evening sky lit up like fire. The food was just okay. I was actually a little let down. It was kind of the first underwhelming meal we've had in the last 10 days of traveling. I'd recommend the free house made bread with there house made olive oil. I'd also recommend the Gnocchi di pane di tumminia al pistachio di Bronte and the bbq chicken. Out of all the things we ordered these were delicious. The pork chop was over cooked. The veal isn't really veal and was chewy with a lot of fat. It was a very tough piece of beef. The sausage was good and dense but dry and over cooked. The house made pasta was okay and the tablespoon of red sauce was not enough to even cover it. Luckily I had the bottle of olive oil on the table to make my pasta taste good. The team of waiters were good but they kept trying to take our dishes away without asking. I finally had them trained by the end of dinner. They would actually ask, Can I take your dish now? I was impressed because you can't change a Sicilian.  Breakfast was okay. You had to cut your own salami and bread with the dullest knife in the world. It was like a culinary challenge. If you could cut it, then you could eat it. There were some definite health violations with everyone touching the bread and meat. If you wanted orange juice you had to squeeze it yourself. We definitely had to work for our breakfast.  We stayed at many B&B's in Sicily and the breakfast here was our least favorite. It didn't feel special. We also didn't care for the room. It was very dark and the lack of air conditioning made the room uncomfortable. We couldn't even open the window because our screen had a whole in it. We already had a room full of flies and I didn't want to let more in. We would definitely not come back to this location.","24808":"This was our first stay at an Agriturismo and it surpassed our expectations, staff were so friendly and helpful, accommodation was clean, spacious and well organised. The restaurant produced wonderful food, mostly grown by the farm or neighbouring farms. Locals visited the restaurant every night and there were several large functions whilst there but these were well managed and we never felt crowded or overlooked which evidenced how good it was. Pool was heaven in the heat and quiet. Highly recommend a visit.","24844":"Vultaggio is my first agriturismo. And what a wonderful experience! Five stars is not enough. Also the spa is great, best \u201crelaxing massage \u201c ever. We had possibility to have a cooking class with Francisco. Warm (self made) bread, olive oil, a little salt and some local red wine. Perfect.","24846":"Clean rooms, great facilities, nice location. Pool area to relax, nice area for an early walk, nice people and do therir best to accommodate everyone. You have to eat here, very good fresh tasty Sicilian food.","24856":"Adding a lot of sugar, salt and grease is the easiest way to improve mediocre food. But even that trick can go wrong. Both the swordfish caponata and the Sicilan caponata contained far too much sugar. We did not finish those courses. The sea bass was also a little too sweet but mostly dull. The local wine, zibibo secco, was the only thing that we enjoyed.","24858":"We stayed at Ai Lumi for 4 nights. The rooms were air conditioned, spacious and comfortable and well serviced daily. Breakfast was comprehensive in traditional Sicilian fashion with no hot food options.  Potential visitors should be aware that there is no lift service as all rooms require walking up flights of stairs . However, there is a hoist that is used to take luggage to the required level  The location is excellent  My only criticism is that despite there being sound proofed shutters, it cannot block out the considerable nightly street noise","24860":"Fabulous food had a pork fillet in a sauce with bacon tasted Unbelievable great service very friendly staff will definitely come back again, it\u2019s the best food I had in this trip to Italy , the shopping in this area is also great so be prepared to have a wonderful time in Trapani :hearts::hearts:","24863":"It\u2019s a lovely looking restaurant, both nice to sit outside and in. Friendly service and great food. The seafood is amazing, especially the rolled stuffed swordfish and the squid. I will definitely return before I leave. A great find.","24870":"We enjoyed our short stay at this charming and central B&B. Francesca and Roberto were very helpful with information on parking and what to see. Our spacious room on the top floor had a small balcony overlooking the pedestrian main street with a great view of the evening passeggiata and a kitchenette with the only kettle we saw in our trip. Be prepared for stairs as no lift, but your luggage is hauled up in an ingenious basket from the courtyard below. The breakfast is served in the family owned restaurant next door which also provided a great Sicilian dining experience in the evening.","24875":"Great room with kitchen and sitting area, the staff were charming and couldn't do enough for us! I liked the restaurant too which lets you pick your fish from today's catch. Spigola - sea bass - and orata - sea bream - are lovely.","24876":"Visited the restaurant with my partner as it has been recommended by a local for excellent seafood. Unfortunately the food was absolutely tasteless. We ordered the squid and prawns to start. Tasteless. We then ordered the fisherman's plate x2 for our main meal. Again, tasteless and extremely disappointing. The restaurant itself is beautiful but the food was average to poor and the staff were not pleasant. I would not recommend this restaurant.","24877":"Ai Lumi is a beautiful palazzo on the main street of the old city. Other than the steps which weren't a big deal, my husband and I loved our stay here. Our friends reported problems with their shower being loose, but our room was wonderful. Very Sicilian in decor, comfortable bed and good shower. Nice sitting room and kitchenette. Even though this was a main restaurant street, it was quiet at night. The restaurant was next door and the breakfast was delicious. Check-in out were easy. Wi-fi worked well. We had some difficult finding the location by car, but once found, easy walk but a bit of a jog from the parking. Nice folks at reception.","24885":"We had a great and pleasant stay, the staff was very attentive and the room was comfy. The mattresses could have been a bit more comfortable. The only downside: their breakfast. It was very frugal and did not offer much variety.","24887":"Average Sicilian cuisine (maybe just above average). Very simply prepared but the highest prices in Trapani. If these guys have a Michelin plate half of Trapani deserves one. Underwhelming.  Excellent service","24888":"We were walking past and the menu looked good. We had an outstanding dinner here. A taste sensation. The service was very good and the food portions generous. Would go there again in a flash. Loved the food.","24892":"Management was friendly, helpful and caring. Living quarters was plentiful and in the center or town. Breakfast could have been a little better. A short walk to the ocean and great seafood. It would be hard to get anything more for your money.","24904":"Loved the experience of staying in a beautiful old palazzo in best street in city. It was not perfect in that it took 4 days to get the smell of previous guests unauthorised cigarette smoking out of room. And a lot of noise from street but still loved it. Spacious, great ambiance and great restaurant. Hope to return","24921":"What a lovely place to stay. We had a small self catering apartment which was very clean and tidy. Lovely comfy bed, and the bedroom also had a small balcony out to the street. The lady who greeted was very polite and helpful in things to do, what to see, where to go. Unfortunately we didn't have time to make full use of this advice so will have to have a return visit. Although the Residence does say there is parking, be aware that it is limited and the streets are tight! We were advised to park in the large public carpark, 10 min walk from the place which proved to be the right choice. The charge is 10 cents per hour which is nothing. Each level has it's on little outside but enclosed space for sitting, eating or smoking. Also there is a roof terrace if you wish to take your breakfast, or pizza up there to eat in the morning evening? Or you could just sun bathe?","24922":"This last minute choice was a great choice for the night with parking. Bed comfortable and very charming place. Owner very helpful, nice and gave good recommendations. We travel a lot and have called others in Europe many times but couldn't figure hers out. Booked online and communicated by email, worked out great! The oldest place that makes Cannoli's is across the street, so we had to try and they were amazing!","24923":"Lovely apartment in Trapani old town, close to all the lively streets and tourist sights.  The room is exceptionally clean and fresh, well decorated, with a small balcony overlooking the street. It is very quiet at night so one does not have to worry about their sleep.  The hostess, Ornella, is absolutely charming. She is always available to help with a smile, and gives good recommendations about restaurants and tourist sights.  Concerning the parking that many people talk about, Ornella sends many possibilities before your arrival. I suggest that you read well her messages. I found parking at Piazza Vittorio Emanuele, I paid 2,50 euros for 25 hours, which is more than reasonable.  I strongly recommend you to stay at this apartment, you will certainly have a nice stay in Trapani.","24924":"Even though we were assigned a different room from the one we had made a reservation for (the Studio, Balcony), it was still large, quiet and comfortable. The breakfast is served not at their terrazza (as the pictures on the hotel\u00b4s site may suggest) but at a near-by little piazza caff\u00e8, and it\u00b4s an interesting experience of the local life, including the flies coming after the food... Ornella and Giovanna were very attentive and helpful at the reception.","24925":"Our apartment in this old house was small but very quiet, exactly what we wanted. It is a few minutes walk to the heart of the old city or to the sea front and ferry terminals. Walking here was perfectly safe even at night. Simply furnished and a bit tired, but the kitchenette was all we needed. Plenty of lovely hot water too. The bed was very firm. The roof terrace was large with lots of nooks and crannies and patio furniture and a couple of sunbeds, ideal for relaxing in the sunshine. (We thought it was underused.) The lady who welcomed us told us about various places to visit and things to do. She also recommended some local restaurants and was generally helpful and very charming.The bar nearby was available for a reduced rate coffee and brioche breakfast, but we preferred to do our own thing. If you want a quiet place in Trapani this would be it!","24926":"This apartment hotel is in a nice place of the old town just 10 mins walk from the bus terminal or train station. Small rooms but good facilities and we had a nice complimentary wine on the roof top terrace. Service was excellent and we obtained discounted tickets to cable car. One point about ferries to the islands - make sure you book the day or at least a few hrs before you want to travel. We went and had to wait 2 hrs fir the next ferry as the one we wanted was sold out. Islands are nice but I would take a guided tour if you can afford it. Trapani was a nice place to visit","24927":"You won't be sorry to book a stay at residence san domenico. Ornella and staff are so outgoing and informative about the many things Trapani has to offer, from things to do, discounted tickets, places to eat very well, and when to go for the best views. The rooms are big, clean, and the bed is very comfortable. Our only regret is not staying longer!","24942":"Just a few issues which were solved. We will definitely come back to the place. Lovely attention by Ornella and Giovanna!! They help us in about everything. Nice umbrella free for the beach ( You DO need one) !! Lovely location and basically free parking 3 m away!","24946":"A great location, comfortable and beautiful place to stay, and an attentive and helpful staff. What more could you ask for? We liked it so much that we made arrangements to film a few scenes for our small movie production at the hotel. A great experience.","24949":"Staying at San Domenico was a great idea..literally everything is just perfect..the location, apartments (spacious and clean with super comfortable bed )..lovely patio like a bonus..big thanks for everything to very helpful and kind souls working there <3","24952":"We have pangs of wonderful memories from our stay with Ornella at this awesome place. Fabulous location and the most friendly neighborhood imaginable. This actually is a small residence, very clean with mini-kitchen. This place is Sicily at its best!","24953":"Would definitely recommend this place. the hotel is close to everything and I couldn\u2019t have asked for more help from Ornella and Giovanna. The apartment was clean and spacious . Be sure to check out the local bakery and authentic pasta restaurant","24955":"San Domenico's location in the historic Centre gives it easy access to everything you would care to see and places to eat. We especially enjoyed our daily breakfast on the little piazza not more than 20 steps from the hotel. But what makes this place really special is the staff - polite and easy to talk to but always professional. Ornella and Giovanna go out of their way to make every guest feel special and that's what puts this hotel over the top. Highly recommended!","24962":"no elevator lift otherwise perfect. very helpful manage meant right in the heart of Trapanni which is a blue collar town and isn't glamorous but has a real italian feel. the management of young women was helpful and info on rest and things to do. they park for you but take smallest car available as streets are narrow. gps a must","24963":"Very warm welcoming with useful information about the city and what to do. The studios are very clean and well equipped. Very well let cated around many of the Trapani attractions (beach, Cafes...). Special thanks to the very professional team of the residence, always willing to help with a smile!! Very much recommended.","24977":"very friendly, understanding and super-flexible staff, dedicated to their job, coming with lots of suggestions and needful help. Very clean facilities, rooms with all furniture you need. Situated in the heard of the old town closed to everything: shopping, history, culture, harbour and beach","24978":"Great staff, location and rooms as shown in pictures. Parking is off site but hotel close to restaurants, shops and offered helpful information on boat tours etc. highly recommend. Thanks for having us","24981":"We stayed at the San Domenico for three nights. We arrived late afternoon after getting the train from Palermo and were given a complimentary room upgrade! The room was enormous with a lovely balcony with table and chair, own kitchen which we used one night and plenty of space within the room too! We were given plenty of ideas of places to visit at check-in which we really appreciated. We ended up buying the cable car tickets to Erice from reception at a discounted price. The location is great, a short walk away from restaurants, bars and shops. Bear in mind the streets are very narrow if you are travelling with a car. The residence even booked us a fab taxi service to Trapani Airport to pick up our own car hire. The guy didn\u2019t speak a word of English but that didn\u2019t stop us bumbling through a conversation! We had a really lovely time here. I\u2019d recommend to anyone wanting a few days away to wonder around Trapani. There\u2019s just so much to see and do here! We\u2019d love to come back. And check out the pastry shop right next door, proper working kitchen and the best cannolis we\u2019ve had yet! We enjoyed them on the roof terrace for breakfast!","24982":"thank you Ornella for such a wonderful stay, you and your staff were so friendly and helpful. Great location for lovely Trapani...in the old town with bars and restaurants close by...enjoyed every minute and would recommend","24983":"great place, very well situated in the old town. the people there are amazing, super helpful and welcoming, they arranged private parking while we were going away on favignana, gave us great tips, upgradedour room, answered all our questions. our room was spacious, clean and confortable. very nice roof patio. excellent value for the price. would highly recommend! thanks so much!!","25003":"This is the place to stay if you need to get to the airport or take the aliscafo to the islands. It\u2019s no more than a 5-minute walk from the aliscafo terminal, the ticket office, the bus stop, and many taxi companies. It\u2019s also a 5-minute walk from some of the best local restaurants and some of the important tourist sites of Trapani. You can\u2019t do better in terms of location.  The hotel is basically your old-fashioned small Italian hotel but updated with modern bathrooms and efficient air conditioning. The management and staff are very welcoming and helpful; the little black-and-white mascot dog Willie is also welcoming although he is too old and tired to be very helpful.  A basic but good breakfast is served, with excellent cappuccino. A sense of helpfulness seems to spill over from the staff to the guests; we were surprised to see that many of the breakfasters picked their dirty dishes up and took them to the serving counter.","25005":"We were disappointed with this hotel. The room was clean but entirely lacking in character. No friendly information, staff at reception weren't great. Maybe we were unlucky to stay on a Saturday night, but the noise of revellers in the street was very loud till 3am. We were on 2nd floor. Outside a few main streets Trapani was pretty dirty and in lovely. We didn't think this hotel was good value given its midrange price, around 50 euros.","25010":"Hotel has a very friendly ambience. Rooms quite large and comfy. Breakfast had a vast selection of very tasty items. Ideal location as it in in the historic centre but still close to restaurants, and close to public transport.","25014":"Location: Couldn't have been any better! It's a walk away from the port and also the central roads of Trapani.  Room: Our room was recently refurbished I think as the area seemed different than the other corridors. Was a bit smelly sometimes you have to close the bathroom and the taps. A C and TV worked perfectly. Small and cozy. It was quite also even though we had a balcony facing the main road. The walls need a bit of paint as there are marks on it.  Service: Excellent. Very helpfull staff. Room cleaned everyday.  Price: Worth it.","25155":"I had a friend find me a last-minute room in Trapani, and was very happy. The location is amazing (after my daytrip to Erice I decided I'd walk home to the hotel through the Mediterranean instead of down the street) and the port was a few steps away, which made getting the ferry to Pantelleria and the bus to Palermo really easy, even with all my luggage. It's also right by the main shopping and dining streets, as well as a tourist information office.  The staff were all really friendly and helpful, and were patient with my awful attempts at Italian.  The room was very basic but totally clean, and the courtyard and little public areas were really nice. I will go back!","25156":"I arrived on the ferry with a recommendation from a friend to stay at Albergo Moderna. At 30 euro per night I felt the room was clean and served my needs. The room was serviced daily and the desk service was more than helpful, and their English was much better than my Italian. The location is prime.","25194":"We had the wonderful opportunity stay at this lovely B&B last summer. Teresa and her husband Ignaziio are absolutely wonderful people and do everything possible to make you feel right at home from day one. They really went overboard to make our stay there as relaxing and carefree as possible. They even picked us up at the airport and drove us back which we really didn't expect. The breakfasts that Teresa served were absolutely the best we had in our stay in Sicily. No Sicilian speciality was missing from the breakfast table which is situated outside in the middle of their lovely garden full of flowers. I would highly recommend this B&B to anyone who in planning on visiting Trapani...for us it certainly was a wonderful introduction to Sicily!","25355":"In the old historical quarters of Trapani with its small squares, caf\u00e9es and churches lies Antica Corte delle Ninfee behind ancient monastery-walls. When we enter the garden it feels as time stops. The calm, the peace, the fruit-trees and the water-lily-pond arouses both cuoriosity and interest. Each apartment has its own character and is tastefully designed. You feel comfortable and you can enjoy a luxuriously relaxed stay.","25389":"Much better than few hotels which I viewed before booking this place. Amazing place (in the center of the city), beautiful views around, very tidy, everything what you need in the room, lovely owners, great service - transfer from the airport.","25455":"We had a three-night stay on a Fri., Sat. and Sun. Be prepared not to sleep, if you are there over a weekend. The El Borracho bar, a brew pub & other very noisy venues are quite literally right around the corner (which you can\u2019t see from the front door). Check in was easy, but we never saw any staff for the rest of our stay. We understood that linens would only be changed every four days, but housekeeping would be provided every other day. We had no housekeeping whatsoever, ran out of toilet paper and accumulated trash, because no one emptied it. The jacuzzi on the terrace was monopolized by noisy kids with parents who did not control them, so we opted not to enjoy it. There is free parking, but it\u2019s located a good 1 3 of a mile away. The room itself was modern and well-appointed. There was no one there for check out, so we left the room tax and key inside the room. Overall, the negative aspects of our stay far outweighed the positives.","25464":"Enzo and his dog, Argo were amazing hosts. Enzo was incredibly hospitable and went above and beyond the duties of a host. He helped us tremendously with our various travel arrangements and was a charming conversationalist. He was very generous with his time and with the information he imparted. We enjoyed spending time with him and we enjoyed the accommodations, especially the rooftop terrace.","25530":"Enzo is the epitome of the perfect host. We arrived late and tired one night at short notice and were welcomed with open arms, cold white wine, homemade delicious bruschetta and the warm and helpful conversation of Enzo and his loving dog, Argo. After one night in Casa di Argo, we cancelled our booking at forward planned accommodation elsewhere, we knew we had found something special. The house is an ever-evolving creative project with beautifully curated collections of tiles, sculptures, plants, shades, colour... the terraces are peaceful and beautiful places to sit and eat delicious breakfasts, looking at the sea and quiet neighborhood getting on with life and the swallows flying around. The old fishing quarter where it is situated has a very real and relaxed feel, with the friendly neighborhood dog showing us to the beach every morning. Enzo was so generous and considerate in sharing his recommendations for special places to visit and eat in the region, and even more generous in including us in his social life- sharing many delicious dinners and late night conversation with his lovely friends. It was here, much more than on our day-trips, that we came closest to getting to know a 'Sicilian' culture, and we found it wonderful. I have since recommended the 'casa di argo experience' to many friends and am very grateful for our time there. Enzo goes above and beyond any call of duty for a B&B host, and anybody travelling in the region is missing out if this is not their destination.","25577":"A delightful stay, great adventure & highly recommended. We received a very warm welcome at this working farm with coffee & cake (& a guitarist played & sang for us) even though our hostess was in the middle of preparing for the arrival of a large party who were coming to learn how to make & then eat pizza, couscous & pasta dishes. We were invited to join in with the cooking school. The dinner & breakfasts were delicious & the service very good. We were served the locally produced wines (had the first bottle of the new season white) & olive oil. Comfortable en suite room although it had seen better days & was perhaps typical of what you ought to expect at this type of accommodation. The hostess helped us with a medical problem & has great contacts (eg with a local taxi company).","25579":"From the moment we arrived until the moment we departed, this place made us happy and relaxed. We pulled up around 4:00 pm to this, the 6th and final stay of our 2-week \u201ccircumnavigation\u201d driving trip around Sicily. As I shut off the engine in the drive next to the courtyard entrance, I was prepared to take out luggage out, check in, park the car, etc. Instead, Colette insisted we simply drop everything, leave the car where it stood, walk into the lovely courtyard, have a seat in the shade, and submit to her care. As she herded us to a charming table (I was still thinking but shouldn't we check in and move the car?), surrounding by flowering plants and canopied by what we later learned was a 200 year-old grapevine, Colette simply directed \u201cyou\u2019re on vacation now\u201d.  In a moment, she returned with a tray of exquisite fruit salad (and in my 50++ years I have never thought the words \u201cexquisite\u201d and \u201cfruit salad\u201d together, before that day), plus a bottle of white wine, bread, a basket of napkins, flowers, and both still and sparkling water (because, she explained, she wasn\u2019t sure which we\u2019d prefer). We came to discover that simple way of handling the water question revealed much of Colette\u2019s core philosophy of hospitality\u2026 you\u2019re on vacation, you should be made comfortable, you should not be bothered with questions that can be avoided with a little extra hospitality.  But wait. Thirty minutes later, Colette arrived with a new tray containing a basket of grilled bread slices and 3 small bowls for making bruschetta \u2026 one with the classic chopped fresh tomato, garlic and basil; one of crushed olives; and some kind of savory compote of sun-dried tomatoes (new to us, and delicious). I looked at my watch (about 5:15 at this point... I write my TripAdvisor notes every evening while traveling so I won't forget the small stuff) and thought \u201cwe've been here about an hour and we are TOTALLY relaxed\u201d (I enjoy my holidays very much, but complete relaxation is not automatic for me). And our car was still on the front drive. I understood by then that we were in an enclave, in every sense of the word.  Then we decided to mosey on over to the pool. I asked for 2 glasses of red wine (we\u2019d finished our bottle of white). Colette said sweetly \u201cyou go to the pool; we will bring you the wine; you are on vacation\u201d. A nice, quiet young man delivered the two glasses of wine about 3-4 minutes later. But then he returned about 5 minutes later with a plate of cheese. When we thanked Colette later for sending the cheese, she smiled and said \u201cyou can\u2019t drink red wine without cheese!!\u201d  After that multi-course welcome that lasted from about 4:00 to 6:00 or so, we took a quick nap, then showered and dressed and arrived in the charming, agritur-style dining room around 8:30 (could have eaten in the courtyard but was a little cool that first night). It was a Wednesday night in late May and Colette greeted and seated us warmly, then announced \u201cyou are my only guests\u2026 what would you like me to cook for you tonight?\u201d We explained we are vegetarian (my wife is 100% and I am 90%), and she replied \u201cwell then, I\u2019ll fix you some nice things from the garden\u201d. And Colette, during our dinner, proceeded to come out to us with a total of 9 (I counted and photographed) different plates!!! Each was truly lovely -- you could have randomly chosen any 3 of the 8 (+ dessert = 9) and made a lovely dinner from them. And Colette exuded pleasure and warm hospitality throughout the entire evening.  My 10:45 pm journal entry that same first night: \u201cWe\u2019ve now been here a grand total of about 6 & \u00bd hours, and we are in heaven!\u201d  Quick recap: This place looks great \u2013 exactly what I\u2019d hoped for in a 300 year old farm. The hospitality not only acts   feels warm, but really delivers at every single opportunity from start to finish. Colette even walked us to our car our final morning and gave us each a hug. Delicious food at every meal (I didn\u2019t even get a chance to tell you about our pool-side lunch on day 2\u2026 they brought us a table, linens, stemware, ice bucket, the whole deal)\u2026 always bursting with wholesome freshness, herbs, tastes, smells\u2026 yum. EXACTLY THE KIND OF EXPERIENCE WE HOPED FOR WHEN WE BOOKED OUR SICILY TRIP. Start here for a happy beginning to your trip, or finish here to guarantee ending your trip on a high note. Thank you Colette. Thank you Fontana Salsa.","25591":"To say this s the worst place we have ever stayed is an understatement. The place is filthy from the courtyard to the rooms. The woman who runs the place is a witch. She speaks English, quite well, but that's where it stops. The food was ok, dinner is better than breakfast. Don't waste your money here folks, there are better places in the area that leave this one for dead!!","25595":"Fontanasalsa is a picturesque, working olive farm some ten minutes drive from Trapani Airport. The main courtyard retains its original paving stones leaving a wonderfully authentic, peaceful place to stay. A stroll around the surrounding orange and olive groves will quickly relax any stresses!  Perhaps the key feature is the welcome that you are given. Fontanasalsa is run by Colette who spent all of my two week stay making sure that I was pampered at every second. She and her team fed me fantastically throughout the day and each room has a fridge for storing anything else.  This is definitely the place to stay if you enjoy your food, beautiful surroundings and easy chat with interesting people. It's not the place if you want a supermarket next door!  Highly recommended, something completely different and an excellent price. There is use of a swimming pool in the summer. Also bikes to get to the beach.","25597":"We arrived by bike, exhausted. We were made so welcome and the food was absolutely delightful. The rooms were good, and the weather was cold but we had excellent heating   clothe drying facilities in the room. You are staying on a working olive farm and I loved this so much more than your standard 4 star hotel. A great taste of Sicily.","25608":"Baglio Fontanasalsa is quite basic and rustic, but the rooms are comfortable, and the cooking is excellent. There is a swimming pool and attractive courtyard but little else. I wouldn't recommend staying here for more than a few days but it is a good stop off point if travelling around Sicily.","25612":"If you go to Sicily, make arrangement to transfer to Fontanasalsa a village on the Western coast for a typical lunch of the region. This bag io is an 18th country villa restored. The lunch was one of the highlights of our trip. The owners are a delight and the olive oil is sooo delicious. Do not miss","25686":"I stayed at the Almaran for 4 nights in September. I had a single room which was clean and comfortable with private bathroom just accross the hall. The host, Antonio, was very helpful and friendly and can give lots of tips and information about the city and surrounding area. The locations is great as it's right beside the port and near bus stops. The breakfast is quite basic but overall it's a nice place with good value for money.","25690":"Pros:  * Great location * Clean * The host, Antonio, will give you good tips (for restuarants, etc.) * Air condition  Cons:  * Can be a bit noisy in the morning * From where I come from, the breakfast you get at Almaran is not a breakfast, regarding both quantity and quality. Big room for improvment here.","25693":"Nice clean room with airco. Trapani didn't seem very interesting but it's a very good base for visits to Egadi islands and various spots nearby. So a rental car is very recommended. Owner Antonio offers hospitable service, very Cicilian i might say. Authentic! Breakfast - there is room for improvement here. On the other hand, there is a good gelateria right around the corner. We had a nice stay here!","25695":"Almaran is situated in the heart of Trapani. Even though we stayed there one night we were able to explore the city !! Localisation offers multiple choice, you can go down the road to visit local bars, you can walk along the port or head to the historical part of Trapania. All is at hand, no longer than few minutes walking distance. Also Antonio, owner of the B&B was very kind to us, with good sense of humour and perfect english ! PS. living conditios, outstanding !  Olga,Ala&Aga","25696":"I was very happy to find this hotel which is very clean and good placed (bus, boats, trains, city center...). You can also meet a man (the owner) who really cares of you and do the best for you. I'll be back if i can as soon as possible.","25698":"Really central location, conveniently located only metres from the airport shuttle bus stop. Very comfortable place to stay and the owner Antonio is extremely helpful; he even had my coat sent to the airport by his driver when I accidentally left it in the wardrobe!","25699":"Spotlessly clean, simple accomodation though rather noisy in the morning. Very convenient location for the town centre and port. Very convenient for buses too and from the airport. The owner, Antonio, speaks very good English and could not be more helpful. Consider it highly likely that we will return to Trapani and will certainly return to stay at Almaran","25700":"Pros: - Towels and sheets included - Nice rooms - Flexible breakfast and check-in hours - Good contact in advance - Helps out with every problem - Laid back and calm attitude - Special offers on tourist attractions  Cons: - It was difficult to know when to find the host in the afternoon evening as there was no open reception.","25701":"We had a lovely stay here - location was perfect to explore the town and about 30 seconds from the ferry to the island, also just a minutes walk to the airport shuttle bus stop. The room was great and the owner lovely - his coffee with breakfast delicious, and he was very helpful with local info!! well worth a stay!","25703":"Almaran is a very nice place to stay, also if you are a woman travelling on your own. The rooms are clean and comfortable, some also with balcony. The place is situated very close to the busstation, the railwaystation, the harbour and the seafront. Just around the corner you\u00b4ll find everything you might need. Antonio, the owner is very nice and helpful. He also speeks english. A very good place wich I highly reccomend! Monika","25713":"We spent a lovely week at Belveliero and thanks to Giovanni it was just great!! He was very helpful and gave us good advices on what to do and where to go. He met all our needs and made sure that we were enjoying our holiday. The room was spotlessly clean. Breakfast was always nice and varied. Food at the wine bar... divine!!! Thank you Giovanni for everything :blush: You'll surely see us again :blush: Please say thank.you to your parents too!!","25714":"great place. locatioan, b,b. good owner. english speaking that was helpful. had lift. was suited to me with blind dsablty and health issues.. good size room with bathroom. lots of eat out takeways on frotnt round the corner on the main road from of sea harbour.. only one down side was not many english speaking peopel in buuuusiness reas all around trapani. even at airport and on bus. bad for tourist country. major tourist destinaton. dificult for me as also blidn cant read mednlue or signs on shops and cafes. .they not helpfu... they could enen undsstan simple engl.sihs sto help read menuj or what they sell. i been itally last yeasr to tunis but in village that was same problem but was a village. they could do better to encourage tourissm othwise discourage.. weather was good.easy to get round for me com;paresd to malta. not hilly or broken roads and paths.","25716":"Our room was on the third floor but this isn't a problem as there's a lift. We had a small balcony and a wonderful view of the sea although I don't know if all rooms have this. The B&B is directly opposite the area where the hydrofoils leave for the beautiful Egadi islands which is convenient if you plan to visit them but is also a short walk away from the centre of Trapani. Our room was clean and had an ensuite bathroom. There was also a little fridge and a kettle (no tea or coffee though). Breakfast is served in the owner's cafe downstairs and comprised of a wonderful array of croissants and cake although there was fresh fruit and cheese and ham for those without a sweet tooth. We were happy with our choice of B&B and the price was very reasonable too. As for Trapani itself, we planned to just use it as a base to visit this area of Sicily but it turns out that it's a really lovely city so we enjoyed exploring it too.","25717":"what makes the bb so good are the owners giovani was great he booked a taxi for us and met us at the bb on our arrival.the rooms are large old fashioned and charming ours had a nice view of the port from the balcony.the breakfast is served 2 doors down at the wine bar we enjoyed our stay in trapani the centre is only 15 minutes walk.thanks again to giovani and is family if we return to trapani we will book this bb without hesitation","25722":"(English) In Trapani, B&B Belveliero is strategically located by the Port (passengers\u2019 terminal) to make easy access to ferryboats or hydrofoils to islands like Favignana, Levanzo or Marettino, a few steps away from down town, the closest seaside beach or 5-minute drive to the clear waters of the village of Casa Santa. Our room was clean, quiet, well-furnished, and featuring air-conditioning facility. Comfy beds proved helpful to my almost chronic lower-back pain. A useful and full-fledged kitchen next to the room. In addition, free beach umbrellas available to all its guests. Daily breakfast, served at the family run wine house, the Wine House (reviewed separately), offered a wide range of just-baked croissants (jam, cream, choco), cakes, fresh tomato and mozzarella sandwiches as well as fresh local fruit (nectarines, grapes, plums) and hot drinks like cappuccino, latte, milk or tea. An now, after this brief on service and facilities available at the b&b, it is time to introduce the heros behind the scenes who make it work: the reliable Giovanni, the untiring and enthusiastic Mr. Aldo and the charming Mrs. Pauline. Thanks to these three great persons, our stay was always pleasant and we felt like home. They treated us like family members and provided us tips and hints on what to do, where to go, what to visit or dodge. Amid late evening, while sipping a glass of local white wine Zibibbo available in their wine house, and talking about Sicilian food, relax and crystal-clear seawaters, Mr. Aldo instinctively came up with a set of tips on must-see places on the island of Favignana and helped us organize our one-day trip there and made it unforgettable. Besides thanking wholeheartedly these three exquisite and exclusive persons, I strongly recommend a stay at B&B Belveliero to all those persons or families to whom a truly human touch matter  (Italiano) Il B&B Belveliero e' posizionato in un punto strategico di Trapani: di fronte al Porto (terminal passeggeri), con facile accesso ad aliscafi o ferry per le isole di Favignana, Levanzo o Marettino, a pochi passi dal ben preservato centro storico (Corso Vittorio Emanuele), a 20 minuti a piedi dalla spiaggia trapanese (piu\u2019 vicina) o a 5 minuti di auto dalla piu\u2019 curata spiaggia di Casa Santa. La camera presso la quale alloggiavamo era confortevole, pulita, ben insonorizzata, con vista sul Porto e dotata di aria condizionata. Letti di buona qualita\u2019 anche per chi come me, soffre di mal di schiena. Utilissima anche l\u2019annessa cucina, dotata di frigo molto capiente e nuova macchina da caffe multi-funzione. Info a mio avviso utile, il B&B Belveliero mette, gratis, a disposizione, degli ospiti, degli ombrelloni da spiaggia, fondamentali per chi come noi arriva da fuori Italia. La colazione, servita presso l\u2019enoteca di famiglia, la Wine House (recensita a parte), era molto sostanziosa, e quotidianamente dava la possibilita\u2019 di scegliere tra croissant fresche (marmellata, crema pistacchio, crema pasticcera, al cioccolato di nocciole o vuote) e torte ovvero tra panini freschi al pomodoro e mozzarella e della gustosa frutta fresca locale (prugne, nettarine, uva); non mancavano nemmeno bevande calde quali il cappuccino, il caffe, il latte macchiato o bianco o del the. Ora pero\u2019, dopo questa breve descrizione, viene il bello. Infatti, desidero valorizzare il concetto che il B&B Belveliero rimarrebbe una mera, seppur molto buona, struttura di ricezione turistica se non fosse per la distintiva gestione ed esclusiva disponibilita\u2019, calorisita\u2019 e ospitalita\u2019 che il mitico Giovanni, l\u2019instancabile signor Aldo e la gentilissima e premurosa signora Pauline sanno garantire. Con loro, e per tutta la durata del nostro soggiorno (7 notti, da ferragosto), ci siamo sentiti come se fossimo parte della famiglia, liberi di condividere e scambiare opinioni e punti di vista, o di chiedere semplicemente consigli su cosa fare, dove andare, cosa visitare o cosa non visitare. E una sera, nella loro enoteca, assaggiando un buon bicchiere di Zibibbo, e parlando di cibo, relax e acqua cristallina, il signor Aldo, in maniera del tutto spontanea ed inattesa, ci ha aiutato ad organizzare, in tempo zero, una splendida giornata a Favignana, che grazie alle sue \u201cdritte\u201d rimarra\u2019 anche indimenticabile. Oltre quindi a ringraziare di cuore queste tre grandi persone, consiglio di \u201cfar un salto\u201d a Trapani e di soggiornare al B&B Belveliero a tutte quelle persone o famiglie che in una vacanza ricerchino calore e ospitalita\u2019 sincera","25766":"very nice place clean evrything is good i hope too visit again soon... breakfast is great... velue for money..nice popple great food nice too walk..relax placecentre too ..hope too see it again soon thanks","26089":"Nicely and everything according with the description. The owner is very nice person, brought and drove us out of the center! The apartment is located close to Erice which also is an asset. I recommend!","26112":"B & B Il Cavaliere is very elegantly decorated hotel, where we had a pleasure to live for 10 days. It is situated in a quiet area inhabited by residents of Trapani. That helped us to get to know their daily habits. The B & B Il Cavaliere cares about all the comfort and cleanliness. The rooms and bathrooms are cleaned daily. Piero, the owner of B&B Il Cavaliere is a very nice and friendly person always willing to help. Really cares about the satisfaction of their guests. Breakfast in the Svalutation Cafe is a good opportunity to get to know residents and taste fantastic Sicilian delicacies. If you spend more days there, you'll love this place and you'll miss them when you get home. Trapani is a beautiful and amazing city, worth to spend here some days. It is also a good base for exploring the area. Big thanks to Piero and the team from Svalutation Cafe for great time. We hope to see you once again :) Tomasz, Kaja and Tymon","26140":"I stayed for 8 nights in this lovely B and B in a room with a private bathroom, a small balcony, and a lovely decorated ceiling. The bed was comfortable, the linens changed every 3 to 4 days, and the A C worked well. Paola is friendly and engaging and provides great advice on places to visit and how to get there if you need public transportation (which is right across the street.) She was able to communicate with me in English, which I appreciated. The B and B is walking distance to the old town center and the beach and there is a gelateria and upscale shoping around the corner. She provides a decadent breakfast every morning which is served family style, and she is able to facilitate conversation between guests even when they speak different languages. There is a living room and garden to enjoy if guests want to socialize outside of their rooms and the price is very affordable and a GREAT value. While the building is near the main road (Via Fardella), the noise was not a problem even with the window open. (A relief for this light sleeper.) I highly recommend La Casa di Paola if you plan to stay in Trapani. (Which is a great place to stay if you want to see Segesta, San Vito Lo Capo, The Egadi Islands, and even make a day trip to Palermo. The Trapani beach is great too! Thanks, Paola!","26196":"Spent nine nights at B&B. Ideal neighborhood location allows guests to immerse themselves in daily life. Ideal central location to explore surroundings (so much to see!). Street parking is safe and plentiful. Breakfasts are bountiful; rooms are clean and well apportioned. Host and staff are remarkable. Nine days just flew by!","26326":"We met a problem on arriving to La Dimora Di Odisseo, in cause of some technical problem our room was busy by someone else. The host found for us another room and didn't take money for inconvenience. Nice! Generally he is very accommodating guy, can help you with everything from find best place for your car to suggest excellent place for dinner. And the breakfast was also gorgeous!","26344":"B&B Petali Guest. This guest house have 4 double rooms. We were two couples and our rooms were clean and a nice set up. Stefania Parisi, who run this place, was very helpful and she goes out of her way to help you. She speaks good English. The breakfast was excellent and the dinning kitchen was open for a cup of tea coffee. I recommend who ever visit Trapani to stay at this guest house, B&B Petali. Richard Borg Mosta Malta","26349":"This little B&B provided us with the perfect base for visiting the sights of the Trapani area. So much to see in Trapani, Erica, Marsala,San Vito Lo Capo, Scapello and Castellomare. We did not have enough time to go out to the nearby islands but friends who did recommended them highly. We really enjoyed our 4 days staying in Stefanias B&B Petali and will be recommending this clean, tidy and comfortable facility to our friends.","26434":"Fantastic accomodation with very kind Paola. I was there just one night and it was great. She gave me recommendation to nice restaurant and gelateria. She also gave me map and gave me recommendation for some nice places to visit. Its very close to centre and you can walk there. It take just 5 minutes. Also beach is next to the acommodation. Also big free are for parking so if you will come by car or will rent it as me you can park there. So stay was amazing and is highly recommended. I was in 3 different B&B during my stay in Sicily and this one was the best. Quit thin walls between rooms so you can heard everything from others. This is one but big disadvantage.","26435":"Host was great, very helpful with advice on sites, restaurants and the area. The room was exactly as described. Breakfast was nice as well. Very convenient free parking nearby. There is no elevator (not a problem for us), but one is being added, that may be useful info for some.","26594":"We drove to Trapani from Taormina, dropped our bags at the hotel (note you must park your car in a paid public lot and walk to the hotel because the hotel is in a pedestrian only area) returned the car to Hertz which is not nearby and is aprox. 30 minutes by foot.(the Hertz guy was very helpful and drove us to the port which was much closer to the hotel) We checked in for 3 nights, the location is great for exploring the historic centre by foot and also because there are many restaurants nearby (including one right in the hotel.) The 1 bar suite was very spacious with kitchenette equipped for 3 and has a small table and day bed  sofa. The wifi was good but restricted for streaming ( I.e.Chromecast doesn\u2019t work) The bedroom is a good size with queen bed & TV (no English channels) Our 1st day we did a major walk to the Salt Flats which is in the middle of nowhere and is a good 1 Hr.+ walk.There is a small safe in the closet. The bathroom is good but the shower is small. The staff was very helpful and will give you a tourist map and suggestions on sightseeing. We took a cab to the airport for our flight to Rome and the cost was \u20ac30.","26597":"Self catering. Comfortable rooms. Nice facilities. Good location in which to explore the old town. Nice restaurand next door with al fresco dining\u2014highly recommended.  Disappointing that the tap water is not recommended to drink in Trapani. The hotel should provide unlimited bottled water at no costinstead of one.","26598":"It\u2019s a nice roomy suite hotel. Great location for walking around town. We enjoyed our stay UNTIL we went out for dinner one evening. While we were out for just a few hours, our room was entered and the safe in the closet was cracked. Cash and credit cards were stolen. So - heads up - don\u2019t leave anything valuable in your room or the safe. We suspect an inside job, but no proof. There are Youtube videos that show you how to open a hotel room safe in a few seconds, but entering the room while we were out for just a short while is a little disturbing.","26599":"Very friendly hotel staff very helpful and friendly only one problem because of my disability the lift kept breaking down and I found it hard too walk up the stairs other than that we had a great time x","26615":"We drove to Trapani from Taormina, dropped our bags at the hotel (note you must park your car in a paid public lot and walk to the hotel because the hotel is in a pedestrian only area) returned the car to Hertz which is not nearby and is aprox. 30 minutes by foot.(the Hertz guy was very helpful and drove us to the port which was much closer to the hotel) We checked in for 3 nights, the location is great for exploring the historic centre by foot and also because there are many restaurants nearby (including one right in the hotel.)

I paid extra for a terrace. It was the space beside the air conditioning fans so it was noisy and blew out hot air. The umbrella was broken so the space was not functional at all. Very disappointed with that. Otherwise it was a nice aparthotel.","26633":"I really recommend this hotel. Very kind and helpful staff, good breakfast, clean and big apartment. Perfect location in the historical city center.If I go to Trapani again, I will definitely stay there.","26637":"Great walking in the old city. We loved the rooftop bar and the fantastic location. The staff could not have been nicer. The sunsets from the rooftop are stunning! The on-site restaurant is perfect and beautiful. We will be back!!","26638":"Great service, nice rooms, in the heart of old town, clean, friendly & helpful staff,... we would come back again! We are traveling a lot but this service was amazing and surprised even us! :-) Grazie ragazzi!!!","26640":"This apartment style hotel was very spacious for a European hotel! The bed was large and had the convince of a small kitchen inside! The hotel was close the many of the main attractions in the area. Overall the experience was very pleasant.","26641":"We were only here for one night but we enjoyed our stay. The rooms were very nice, we found the beds comfortable and slept well. The staff were all very friendly and helpful, and we had a really wonderful dinner at the restaurant downstairs.  The hotel is very centrally located and close to many restaurants, shops, churches, etc. Note that because it's located in a pedestrian-only area you will need to walk a few minutes from a cab car etc to the hotel, but it's only a couple of blocks.","26642":"We had just returned from a long day of touring the salt flats of Trapani. Tired and dragging our feet, we arrived at the Badia Nuova Hotel. We were greeted by Vincenzo, the hotel owner, with a hearty welcome and a glass of Prosecco. Our room was a beautiful, Italian modern suite, furnished with a kitchenette, and a couch that doubled as another bed. In the immaculate bathroom, there were pump bottles of bath gel and lotion that smelled like the orange- anilla notes of Sicilian cookies. What could be better. We would love to return to the Badia Nuova Hotel sometime to enjoy true hospitality again and the delicious array of food at the included breakfast.","26645":"Very friendly staff and a welcoming atmosphere. The rooms are nice and clean, although the toilet is really old and unstable. During the night its really loud because you are in the middle of Trapani and there are a lot of people on the streets. But on the other hand convenient for going out exploring the city. Overall we enjoyed our stay!","26647":"We stayed here for 3 nights in the roof top terrace suite. Very spacious with 2 bedrooms which allowed us to spread out and enjoy lots of storage. Decor and facilities were minimalist but more than adequate. I particularly liked the ethos of recycling and using natural toiletries. The bed was exceptionally comfortable too. Make sure however you can walk up and down 8 flights of stairs if you want to stay on the top floor as the lift may be temporarily out of action when used by cleaning staff to move their equipment up and down floors. We ate in the Gusto restaurant on two evenings partly because the weather was very poor one evening but mainly because we enjoyed the local cuisine and wine served there so much. Service was very friendly and efficient. Breakfast is quite limited but for 6\u20ac what\u2019s to complain about! Reception staff were very helpful too.  We would definitely recommend this accommodation for a stay in Trapani as it is so convenient for all the main attractions and only a short walk to the port.","26648":"Nice appartment hotel in the heart of the city. But please ne aware and leave your car out of the pedestrian area. We choose the location as it was advertised to have it's own parking place. We entered the limited traffic area and it was a nightmare to get out of it. So leave your car on corso italia.","26656":"I spent a lot of time selecting where to stay in Trapani and booked this hotel several months in advance. ON THE NIGHT BEFORE OUR ARRIVAL, I received an email stating that our room had been cancelled. They said the room was being renovated and was not ready. I was completely shocked. Although we happened to be in Sicily at the time and were able to scramble around for a new hotel, it could easily have been that we were on our way, not connected to the internet and would have shown up and had no reservation. I find this completely unacceptable. If there was renovation going on, we should have been notified much earlier in order to find a new place to stay. So be careful if you book here. You may end up with no room and no alternatives.","26658":"The location of this residence B&B is terrific -- right in the heart of old town. And the apartments are clean and spacious. We head a great, too-brief stay. Both Vicenzo and Mariateresa gave us great advice on dining and touring. Highly recommend.","26662":"The apartments are very nice and comfortable. The location in town is good. We enjoyed our stay and would definitely recommend this residence. The bed was comfortable and the shower was nice too. We enjoyed the breakfast and the option of preparing food in our own room.","26664":"We had a lovely stay at Badia Nuova. Pina was an excellent host. The accommodations were spotless, very very clean. Everything was exceptional especially the service. Breakfast was yummy, plentiful choices, and a great start to our busy days. The outdoor lounge, rooftop lounge with complimentary wine at check-in, and restaurant next door were fantastic amenities. Centrally located in the historic center. We will be back!! Grazie Mille Pina!!","26758":"My family & I were due to arrive late in Trapani airport. Our friends advised us that we should stay at a nearby hotel before proceeding with our journey the next day. As in previous reviews, we chose this hotel for our one night stay because it is conveniently close to the airport. Taxi for 4 pax was from the airport Euro 17 (reasonable). Staff was very courteous and assisted us well with the checkin procedures. Price factor was also reasonable. The rooms were clean and siutable for a good night's rest. Breakfast was adequate but nothing to write home about.","26759":"We stayed for one night after a late arrival at Trapani - Birgi. Very convenient - few km from the airport. Be sure to check the directions from home. Our GPS had problems finding it. Fortunately we had checked maps in advance. Rooms OK and clean, staff friendly and breakfast fine. We did not use the kitchen facilities or swimming pool. The surrounding small town looked a bit dull.","26762":"This is a resort hotel in the middle of nowhere. It has beautiful manicured gardens, palm trees and rolling hills where sheep roam . There is a nice pool surrounded by cacti and nice landscaping. We had a wine tasting dinner which was fantastic. The wine and food was outstanding. This is a perfect place to just chill out for a few days and relax.","26764":"We had a 5 night stay 16-22 September lovely building in a stunning setting the staff are simply the best and we have to mention Eleanoura Laura Rosita and Salvatore who gave the most excellent service they are a areal asset to this hotel","26767":"My husband and I spent the last 4 days of our two week trip to Sicily at this resort. We were a little worried at first when we got to the front desk and the receptionist didn't speak that much English but we muddled through and the rest of our stay was excellent. The highlight for us were the meals and the servers in the restaurant. We did wine pairings on two of the nights and the attention to detail and explanation was exemplary. The rooms were clean, the bathroom was huge, and we were far enough outside of Trapani but close enough to explore all of the major sites. I would recommend this place in a heartbeat.","26771":"The property itself is very beautiful. Surrounded by the gorgeous landscape.  Pool was good but there\u2019s no server to order drinks or food. You have to get towels from front desk. Lady at the front desk didn\u2019t tell me about it when I asked her how to get to the pool. So I had to walk back to get one from her after one guest at the pool told me how to get a towel. Annoying.  We walked to the wine bar on top of the hill. OMG the view was breathtaking! We took so many gorgeous sunset videos and photos from there.  We enjoyed dinner at the restaurant. They were busy and full but service was pretty good compare to all high end restaurants we stopped by in every towns we\u2019ve stayed. Especially our server, Joseph was \u201creally\u201d good. ( He said he works for the hotel owner for 30years ) He explained to us about Sicilian wines and ingredients. I had cous cous and a local Branzino type of white fish. Presentation of the food and everything was tasteful.  Breakfast was just okay.. Watermelon and kiwi were old. ( I didn't understand why they even wanted to serve them at all. ) They have a cheap instant coffee in room. ( my first time to see instant coffee at a hotel room in Italy ) , cheap shampoo, walls were thin and I could hear the next door was using toilet all the time. WiFi was super fast.  When we checked out, the lady at the front was the nicest among all three ladies we met at the front desk. But she didn\u2019t offer us a ride to the parking lot. We had to carry our luggages to parking lot. This place could be much better if they can provide better service.  Overall, I would recommend people to just go to the restaurant and the wine bar on top of the hill. Not the hotel..","26774":"A nice boutique style hotel with limited amenities. It has a small swimming pool and some lounge chairs for sunbathing or resting. We were there in the afternoon and we had to make a special request to order some foods and drinks. The breakfast and dinner were OK but nothing special. The room was spacious and clean and it came with a complimentary bottle of wine which we really enjoyed. The wine shop was good, and if you are unable to make it for the time when it opens, you can make a reservation. It is about 20 minutes ride from the hotel to the Trapani city centre. We did not have a car and we took a return taxi ride for $50 euro.","26775":"The hotel itself is beautiful. The service and overall quality is not - had better at 3 star hotels. Food menu very limited - they make a big song and dance about a fancy chef - he struggled to make a tuna salad which took over 45 mins to make. The mains look fancy, but the food isn\u2019t nice. The chef is young and ambitious, but his skills are lacking. Things missing in room - no towel for pool even though flyer in room said there would be one. Cleaning service didn\u2019t replace towels when asked, just folded dirty towel from floor and said it was fresh (it was stained so I knew it was the same towel). The bar at the top of the hill. Closed.","26776":"Beautiful property nestled in vineyards. Restaurant was delightful and we especially enjoyed our cooking class! Breakfast selection was plentiful and the waiters were very accommodating. The room however needs improvement. Bathroom was dirty and floor was badly stained. We had ants the second day and reported it to the stern ladies at the reception. Was told she would share the information with a colleague. Second day, more ants! Not acceptable. The ladies at the reception were less than friendly. Such a contrast to the delightful servers at breakfast and dinner.","26777":"My family of 5 stayed at this hotel for 3 nights. We had two rooms. The triple room was great as my daughters shared the queen bed and my son stayed upstairs in the loft area (he loved the privacy) . Rooms were clean and well kept. The rooms should be replenished on a daily basis with soap, shampoo and some conditioner too. This amenities issue seems to be the norm in Italy though. The hotel is set in the countryside on a vineyard. Grounds were lovely. Stores and attractions are approx. 15 minutes away. Only drawback is that the pool closes at 7:00. May I suggest that you keep the pool open until at least 10:00 pm. The staff were excellent!! Big shout out to the front desk clerk Laura and her colleague . We had some problems with the car we rented and they went above and beyond (better than the rental company Europcar did) to help us remedy the situation!! Can't thank them enough. All the waiters were wonderful too--especially Giuseppe!! You could tell he loved his job as he was always so happy and pleasant. Morning waiter always remembered our coffee tea orders. Excellent customer service from all the staff. Would definitely return and highly recommend a stay at this hotel.","26779":"We had a very nice wine tasting and light lunch with Nino. \u201cLight lunch\u201d is funny because to me, it was a very large lunch-but not too heavy. Nino was very knowledgeable and we tasted 1 Spumante, 2 whites and 2 reds, and 1 dessert wine. The lunch was eggplant parm, busiate pesto trapanese and a pistachio cannoli. All very good and great value for 35e. We purchased a bottle of red and of their very excellent olive oil.","26783":"We didn't stay in the resort but dropped by for lunch as per our hotel recommendation. It was a fantastic experience: staffs were helpful and indulgent (we asked and was shown the property), food were excellent (although it was the fine-dining variety and therefore, priced above the usual Sicilian lunch), wines were great.  We took the menu with wine pairing option and we were not disappointed. The wines served as great sample of their products and at the end, we went away with 6 bottles to bring back.  Highly recommended.","26789":"Now 2 months later I realise how wonderful this place was..this was our last hotel on 3 week holiday.. I hope some day we can go back, drink wine, eat food, go for another bike ride. Our room had a wonderful view.. IT WAS GRAND.","26791":"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here. The suite was very comfortable, the bathroom spacious and the bed very comfortable. They use an elongated golf cart to bring you to the hotel from the parking lot, and they always know when you arrive, as the cart arrives just as you are getting everything out of the car. The breakfasts were good, a mix of sweet and savoury. We also had dinner there twice and were pleased with our choices. You are about 15 minutes from \u201cdowntown\u201d Trapani, so there are other options for dining.","26797":"This 17th century farmhouse has been converted to a boutique hotel with a gourmet chef. We used the place as a base to visit Erice, Trapani and Marsala. We did, however, come back to the Resort each evening for dinner....best food in town...very fair prices.","26799":"Me and my wife do wine tasting in every country we visit and this was our best experience of all. It was excellent value for the money. For just \u20ac15 each, we got to taste 6 wines each that are normally not cheap. The quality of the wines was extraordinary, all of them were above average. The real highlight was 2014 Favina Passul\u00e9 made of semi-dry grapes, which tasted like nothing I've tried before. There was nobody else at the tasting session so we had a unique experience of private wine tasting. I'll definitely come back when I return to Sicily. Perhaps the only downside is that you need to pay for taxi to get there which costs more than the actual tasting. At least I didn't find any other way to get there for cheaper (except for walking).","26800":"My husband and I signed up for a wine tasting that included accompanying tastes of local foods. Lucca was our host and did a wonderful job explaining each wine and the taste of food paired with it. We tasted a sparkling wine, 2 whites, 2 reds and a dessert wine. In addition, every single wine was delicious - and this is coming from people who generally do not like white wine at all! We have been at wine tours and tastings all over the world - Sonoma Napa Valley in California, Burgundy in France, Maipo Valley in Chile, Tuscany and Umbria, and this was by far our favorite experience.","26802":"We had terrible directions via email to locate the hotel. Once we called long distance the directions were more clear. Difficult to locate.  Reception at this property is non-responsive. We checked in but did not get a tour of room or property. No information on local attractions. We called reception for WiFi code but no answer. My husband went to reception to obtain WiFi code. Then no TV remote control in room. My husband went back to reception to obtain a new remote control. Looked for CNN or other news station in English. Told by reception to just look for an English Channel. There are none! After a nice drink in the bar with Simon and great dinner in the restaurant, we went back to the room, which was too warm. We tried to reset the thermostat but it would not turn on. Called reception, they came to room but were not able to lower the temperature below 22 Celsius. She said that the room AC would turn on shortly to cool the room. 30 minutes later called reception. No answer for first 3 calls. When she finally picked up, she said to turn off AC and that outside night temperature would cool the room. Would love to open the window but sound from autostrada A29 is too loud. We are not able to sleep due to room temp and we are paying $200 per night for this room. Unacceptable!","26804":"Beautiful setting among the vineyards out in the countryside, nice pool and we liked their wines a lot. Rooms were small but comfortable. Hated the restaurant though - overpriced, terrible service and the food was mediocre. Really wish we had skipped that. If I were to return, I would just do their wine tasting.","26806":"Driving up to this place is impressive, as well as the courtyard upon arrival, but the room was a great disappointment. We reserved a junior suite, which we had done throughout the rest of Sicily and had stayed in lovely large rooms or even a livingroom bedroom, but here we received a small uninspiring room which could have been a Motel 6 room. Very basic accommodations and decor, one small bottle of water just the first day, no washcloths, ran out of tissues and toilet paper with no replacements in the room, and one small little window even though there were beautiful views available. The best part was the Sky Bar up on the hill with amazing views of the valley, town and ocean, but it was only open from 7pm - 9pm. The dining room served wonderful dinners, but their breakfasts were limited and always seemed to run out of items on the buffet, not replacing them until asked. Pool area was a nice place to relax around, though it would have been nice to have had a bar to get beverages to enjoy around the pool without having to walk down to the reception area to request something. Over all, a lovely location , but it seems to be underfunded. With a little investment in the rooms, supplies, and some additional services this could be spectacular, and they could even charge more!","26822":"and excellent restaurant. Otherwise somewhat soulless. Feels new and devoid of character. But if you walk up the hill and earn your drink( or call for the golf cart) you will have a breathtaking view and lovely glass of wine or cocktail.","26823":"Very disappointed in our stay here. The room was very dark and very awkward. The living room was a long flight of stairs and the layout was terrible. The pictures on the site look better than the actual room itself. Strange that cars couldn't drive up to the door and even for a drop off. Had to wait for the cart or walk. Not that big of a deal but again just not usual. Breakfast was weak. Would not stay here again. Glad it was only one night.","26825":"The wonderful host and hostess made us feel so welcome and gave us so much useful information about the surrounding area. They really did try to anticipate every our need. Very clean rooms and an excellent restaurant with great wines of family Firriato. Enjoy cosy swimming pool and explore sorrunding places. Special thanks to the waiter Salvatore and receptionist Eleonora.","26832":"The place is an authentic Sicilian baglio, restored with care and attention for detail. Firriato wines are among the best ones in Sicily. The restaurant, too, is very good. The staff is excellent - very attentative, knowledgable (Antonino about wines!) and helpful. We thoroughly enjoyed our experience - wine tasting, later a dinner and overnight stay - and can sincerely recommend Baglio Soria to every wine lover or traveller looking for a peaceful and refined place where to relax and enjoy!","26834":"My husband and I stayed at Baglia Sofia for 3 nights. The hotel resort is in the wine country and you would either need a car or driver to take you around to neighboring towns or Trapani. From the gentleman who helps with luggage, the receptionist, the wine tasting, the wait staff, food and room....I can not say enough. Everything was clean and everyone was more than helpful. The restaurant is beautiful. We truly enjoyed our stay. The only unfortunate thing for us was getting around. We don\u2019t like to drink and drive so having a late Italian dinner elsewhere in another town was not an option for us. Luckily the hotel has a wonderful restaurant.","26837":"The room was clean and the location was good, but the host was not so friendly, how I expected. We had our room near the kitchen and we can\u2019t use fridge and kettle. The problem was that the room wasn\u2019t equipped with fridge and kettle, that\u2019s why we wanna use this one in the kitchen... but it wasn\u2019t possible, the host means that the kitchen doesn\u2019t work after breakfast. So when he was out he turned off the electricity, So we ourselves could not use ourselves in the kitchen. And you can imagine how it was, outside was 30* and we can\u2019t even drink cold water... By the way he was telling us that he can help us in each way, and as we were both sick and I asked him for help, he didn\u2019t help us. I proposed him or that I will pay him when he buy some medicines, because we can not go outside... He means he can\u2019t help us and doesn\u2019t know somebody who can help us.  At the next day as we had our check out, I asked him or we can stay two hours longer because we are still sick , and he means it is no possible because in few hours will come another guest. And I understood it, but later i have checked it on two sides or this room is free , and the room was free for the next two days. I can\u2019t really understand why he was like that... at first sight he was very kind but his deeds were very bad...  Sooo guys be careful! And remember that in the kitchen are hidden cameras!","26847":"So glad we stayed here for 2 nights. The place is great and very clean. They even left a shampoo in the shower for us to use. Matteo the host was great. Extremely friendly and very sweet. He made us eggs in the morning. The breakfasts is really good. Fresh croissants, fresh fruit, home made cakes, fruit juices, teas and coffees, cheese and salami. I highly recommend this place as it's at walking distance from the city centre.","26901":"The room was wanderful: spaciuos, clean, beds, nice furniture. The service was the best - the manager was always happy to help us or to answer to all kind of questions. The breakfast was excellent - we even had homemade cakes and ice-cream!","26987":"We stayed at the Kore Rooms for 4 days and had an amazing time. Francesca was really lovely and we really felt like at home. The location was perfect with a wonderful terrace view, rooms were really cleaned and breakfast delicious. Highly recommanded! We will definitely stay there again for our next trip to Trapani","26988":"I was in Trapani right when the Coronavirus Lockdown began. I was originally in town, however, when they began spraying chemicals to kill the virus I became very ill. I was unable to return to Germany as my flights were cancelled five different times. I was there for 46 days. I moved to Bike and Kite Accommodations about 20 days into the lockdown and was so very relieved. Noemi was beyond supportive, kind and accommodating. I wish I had been there under other circumstances, but if there were anywhere I'd pray to be at that time, it is there. The accommodation is so very beautiful and has so much to offer! The view of the sea and mountain are breathtaking. I actually miss my mornings having coffee on the patio, listening to the birds and breathing the fresh air. I am beyond thankful for Noemi, her amazing location, and her kind and supportive nature. You cannot go wrong with this place!","26989":"We stayed here In the last week of september for the second time and we still love it!  Clean and very spacious apartment and outstanding hosts Fabio and Noemi!  We will come back for sure!  Thanks guys! J&B","26998":"Our one week stay in the second floor sea view apartment was one of our best during our month long vacation in Sicily. We have never had such incredible hosts like Noemi and Fabio. Their restaurant, touring, and excursion recommendations were fabulous and made our time in Trapani and surrounding areas memorable. The bedroom and living room are spacious and comfortable, the kitchen well stocked. The bathroom spacious with a great shower. Every room has large windows with sea views. Ample free parking is on the property making coming and going a cinch. They have a barbecue area where we grilled a whole fish from the fish market around the corner. The center of town is a 5 minute drive where there is plenty of parking. The apartment is in the perfect location for exploring Trapani and the surrounding area. Food shopping is minutes away. Noemi is always available for any questions or needs. When we arrived for check in, she met us, showed us the apartment and then spend time giving information on Trapani and day excursions. I highly recommend this apartment. This is the place to stay when visiting Trapani. We travel the world and didn't want to leave!","27000":"We stayed in a sea view apartment on the first floor. It was modern, very spacious, comfortable and spotless. The apartment was as shown in the pictures, and as described.  The bedroom had a sea view, clothes hanging area, day bed and balcony. The bathroom was spacious with a large shower and balcony. The kitchen lounge area opened to another balcony...good kitchen with some basic supplies.  There was a large grassed area and garden out the back....camper van parking and also outdoor covered area with barbecue.  There was quite a lot of traffic noise from the street below when the apartment doors were open...the apartments with a mountain view (Erice) wouldn't get this.  Located slightly out of the main centre, with secure parking. Good base to explore the area.  Fabio was a helpful host...good communicator - really nice and interesting person.  Highly recommended","27001":"The last 12 days I could join the \u201cAll Mountain\u201d apartment. It is a modern, spacious one with a beautiful view from the huge balcony on the \u201cErice\u201d. You will also find a nice garden where you can sit and relax and do a barbecue as well.","27004":"I've been there for vacations with my family. I liked the apartment, the cleaness, the size. And I felt like at home, the owners are two guys full of passion for what they are doing. They are ready to fulfill all your needs and make your stay confortable. So don't be shy and ask them suggestions to enjoy the city, the sea and the surroundings. Good job guys!","27006":"The apartment was amazing, spacious and very clean with comfortable beds. Situated so that you had easy access to whatever you wanted to do in the Trapani area from San Vito Lo Capo in north to Marsala in south and Segesta in east, all within 30 min drivning. We stayed in Trapani because of the great kiting spots in the area, but there are so much to do in and around Trapani, so we prolonged our stay several times. Noemi and Fabio are great, and also gives good advice where to go.","27007":"Bight, big and nice room. Especially great bathroom and balcony with a view over the beach. Noemi and Fabio was very serviceminded and helpful. The location is right on the beach, it's a short distance to the city center, we drove our car when we went to city center.","27011":"I stayed with my husband and 1 year daughter at Bite accommodations for 7 days. Location is great - the beach is just across the street. Apartments are eco-styled and spacious with everything you need for a comfort stay. all children facilities were provided as well. Naomi and Fabio are doing a really great job helping people to take the most out of their vacations, their recommendations are really helpful and highly recommended. For kite and bike lovers this place is probably the best we have seen before, but even for families with small babies (like us currently) this is a very good choice.","27012":"I stayed for 5 days in June at Bite with my two girls (8 and 11 years). It was the perfect place to stay. After searching the web and nearby \u201cresort\u201d hotels that were starting to look a bit dated, I decided to take a chance on Bite. The pictures on the Bite website indicated a new upscale apartment\u2014we were not disappointed. We loved Bite, the location, and the hospitality. If we return to Trapani, we will stay here again without hesitation.  Accomodations: Noemi had clear communication with us prior to arrival and even had bikes ready for us in the right size upon arrival. She clearly cares for the facility they\u2019ve created and it shows. She took the time to walk us through all the available options for tourist activities and food in the area. The apartment is well represented by the website pictures and is essentially a well maintained oasis across from a beautiful beach. We had everything we needed in the apartment, and a quick shopping trip to the nearby Conad grocery got us the essential food items to fill gaps between local restaurants. The apartment, is new, well maintained, and clean with comfortable furniture and beds. We used the onsite washer dryer for laundry which comes with all necessary soap softener. Within walking distance there is a cafe for morning espresso and breakfast, a restaurant for a quick bite, gelato and granita for enjoying anytime, and even a scuba shop to pick up mask, snorkel and towels for enjoying the sea.  Activities: We spent the first day on the free beach that is right across from the apartment. White sand...crystal waters...waves for playing...perfect. Noemi booked us a fantastic fast boat tour with Mare And More for our second day there\u2014I highly recommend the tour of Favignana and Levanzo. For a change we drove up to Erice for a cool evening meal and beautiful view. We also took Noemi\u2019s recommendation to visit Spiaggia di San Teodoro\u2014again a perfect spot for my girls. We were able to walk across the wide shallow inlet all the way to the nearby island. Then we spent the remainder of the afternoon at the adjacent bagno and bar where I had a few drinks and the girls played in the warm water. Dozens of kite surfers were visible in the sky from the nearby kiting areas. Our final full day was spent relaxing and enjoying the white sand and waves at Lido San Giuliano were we rented an umbrella, played on the beach, and enjoyed good service for food and drinks. Before leaving Trapini we took the cable car to Erica for one final and spectacular view from the mountain city. The mountain bike trails were visible from the cable car...perhaps when my girls are a bit older ;)  Recommendations: Rent bikes for any nearby activities. The beach area has an easy to use bike lane. The rest of the town is typical Italian roads and drivers. It\u2019s hard to avoid needing a car if you have a young family and we were glad we rented one from our arrival point in Palermo airport. Driving from Palermo is easy (with Google Maps) and there is plenty of parking at Bite in an area that is gated and locked at night. Stay longer than 5 days to see everything. In 5 days with children we saw only a fraction of the sights and activities that are available, but had a spectacular time.  Thank you to Noemi and the Bite team!","27015":"I had heard great comments on the Trapani's Bite, and after one week with Noemi and Fabio (the Bite's hosts), I understand. The location is great: right in front of the sea. You almost can dive from the (HUGE) balcony of your room. Easy to find, easy to connect with main Trapani's roads. The apartment design is really cool, and there's all that you need to find for a perfect stay. Fabio and Noemi have been really helpful with the outdoor activities that I planned with my family: the biking, the hiking and, even though we never tried before, we spent few hours kite-surfing. Fabio made it all happen. Really cool dude.","27016":"My wife and I just stayed here for a long weekend, and it was fantastic! It's a magnificent facility and Fabio couldn't be more helpful or friendly. I was able to kiteboard at the beach right across the street, and we had tons to do, since the town is right nearby. We absolutely loved this place and will be back shortly.","27018":"Summarize what we experienced during our stay :  Professionalism  Familiarity  Funzionality  Very positive and very relax  The appartaments is spacious  Friendly and really helpfull owners  Sin has ended the stay","27020":"Very clean and good furnitured appartments! Have balkonies with great view, common place outside with hammocks and chair bags. Beach is close. Owners were really nice and helpful during the whole stay!","27025":"Wonderful place with a miracle owner. Noemi was very caring and helpful. She spent a lot of time talking about all the attractions in the area. The sea view apartment was very clean and comfortable. It located in a great place, near to the beach and it was perfect location to explore Erice, San Vito Lo Capo, Zingaro Reserve and many more. It was a great pleasure to spend 12 days in Trapani. Thank you Noemi!","27046":"There were other people also staying as we saw them the first evening and at breakfast the following morning but for the rest of our 4 days here it was deserted, only the breakfast waiter and a maintenance worker. This contributed to feelings of isolation and we felt it was a bit strange. Maybe this is a seasonal venue.  It was no problem for Borgo Pida for us to leave our luggage early in the day we arrived, and then went out site seeing. The first evening, a Friday, Bepe recommended a local restaurant which was quite good. There were a few of our fellow guests as they had been given the same advice....On two other nights we ate at the Agritorismo round the corner as it was closer, and had a lovely atmosphere and courtyard.  Apart from the one non-English speaking staff at breakfast, we barely saw anyone when we could have used some advice (although their mobile phone numbers were posted on signs if we needed to contact them)  The room was clean and the bed typically hard, including the blooded bed base that projected 20cm beyond the mattress leading to a bruised knee.  There were no luggage racks but a wardrobe. We ended up with both suitcases on the floor. Hotels and other accommodation providers should recognise that two people staying in one room have a piece of luggage each.  The air con was quite noisy and while there were no low windows for a breeze, the glass door could be left open for a breeze through the outside door movable slats. Unfortunately there was no fly screens and so mosquitos could come in. On this night we didn't feel sufficiently compelled to get out of bed and turn on the lights to use the supplied plug in insect repeller, but did on other nights.  Without the air con noise, there are rural sounds at night - occasionally a bout of dogs barking and roosters crowing but little traffic noise. On only one occasion in four nights did we hear a plane from the nearby airport.  Breakfast consisted of yoghurt, fresh fruit, juice, fresh home cooked crusty white bread with homemade jams, pastries and cake (didn't try); one cereal (cornflakes); ham, cheese and hard boiled eggs. We were told it started at 8:30am but then told 8am was ok which was good for an earlyish departure.  Wifi was very good and only occasionally did we have to re-enter the password.  When we wanted to pay the afternoon prior to leaving - because of our early start the next day - we were told to come back after dinner as he wasn't ready. Seemed odd.","27047":"Very clean and tidy. Genuine breakfast, eat as much as you want and fresh. Nice pool and Jacuzzi. Staff treats you like family, always giving valuable advice. Definitely will be revisited and recommended to family, friends and others. One of the best 5 nights I stayed anywhere.","27086":"We stayed here in May 2013 for four nights.The hotel is situated close to the airport but we didn`t hear any noise.Good breakfast buffet,very nice swimming pool and big garden.No hotel restaurant but quite close to Fontanasalsa Azienda where we enjoyed a few evenings with great live music and fantastic italian food.","27175":"Centrally located and close to all amenities. The room includes a kitchen area which is great for making a cup of tea or making a snack. Our room was at the front of the hotel, so a little noisy from the traffic but tolerable. The wifi was weak and only available if you stood in the bathroom. Breakfast is taken at the patisserie next door that offers freshly made croissants and coffee. The receptionist spoke very good English and was very pleasant and helpful. Safe car parking is available at the rear of the hotel at 5 euros a day.","27177":"Stayed here as we wanted parking which was great. A walk of about 1km to get to the old town for best places to eat for tourists. Very modern and comfortable room which had a hot plate if you're inclined to cook (not us), but no kettle. Breakfast is at a little shop underneath the hotel and was a coffee and cream filled croissant.","27198":"We booked into this hotel to escape Palermo as we had had a bad experience there. This is an amazing place for the price and we were very pleased, and relieved. Our welcome was great and the room modern and clean with everything we needed and came with a free breakfast in the caf\u00e9 beside it! It is on a main road however this was not an issue for us. The receptionist was amazing and helpful and gave us recommendations etc for our stay. Would definitely stay here again if we ever return. Only one thing to note though - they only take case payments so be prepared! Overall - superb!","27334":"Room was large and clean, but not used for quite a while. It smelled strange. Parking is a real problem: or very expensive or about 10 min walking! People in B&B are very friendly and helpful. Breakfast was ok, but not as good as with other B&Bs.","27335":"Our room was large, stylish and clean. We only stayed one night as Trapani was at the end of a drive from Palermo to visit Segesta and Erice. The breakfast was all you could want and Fiodor was a gracious host. The B&B is a bit difficult to find, but centrally located for those staying more nights.","27386":"The room in the fourth floor was really nice. Paintings everywhere and nice colours. The apartment itself is located near a port, tobacco and bakery just outside the house. Fiodor - the owner - is really a nice person. He gives good advices and makes you feel comfortable. The breakfast was quite a feast of local bakery and we loved the Casatella stuffed with ricotta cheese :). Thank you very much.","27483":"Excellent reception by Giovanni, the Manager. The property and the rooms are magnificent, in an old Palace in Central Trapani. We were stranded by Covid19 restrictions, but Giovanni helped greatly to overcome all difficulties. I would strongly recommend this property   accommodation, for whatever reason a visitor comes to Sicily. Guido Cefalu","27490":"We were disappointed how dark are rooms were after the sunny photos on the website. And there is very little interaction with the front desk- they are barely there. And yes, the beds are hard. On the plus side- good location and very clean. Just overall not the best intro to Sicily.","27496":"The rooms were pretty nice but the wifi sucked!!... The beds weren\u2019t very comfortable but, they managed. And the aircondition was nice but it stinked! And the walls are thin! 2 nice features were there was a fridge in our apartment and what I didnt expect was that there was house cleaning every day!  TheTruthfullRater out!","27573":"The view is incredible!! Fantastic location which is easily walkable to all main spots. Staff helpful and friendly but be sure to check opening hours. The apartment is very rustic with loads of charm however it\u2019s very old and in need of updating. Bed really uncomfortable, very basic kitchen. Steep climb to the top apartments so if your elderly or have issues walking probably not the place for you. No parking on site but the staff kindly showed us where to park nearby. Great value for money but would prefer to pay more for more comfort.","27574":"The owners of these apartments kindly upgraded us to a room on the top floor with a large and lovely terrace overlooking the sea. Thanks goodness for the pully system they had installed to carry the bags up the many flights of steep steps. The view was spectacular. The bed and the pillows were very comfortable and they changed the linen every couple of days. The staff helped us with a hire car.  The apartment was on the top floor with many steep steps and was quite rustic. The kitchen had no storage or bench space for preparation of food and only a tiny table to eat from. It was very rustic with an old stone sink which you didn\u2019t feel like you could get clean, no kettle, and no toaster. The bathroom was equally rustic with the toilet positioned 9 inches away from the wall. There was a very damp and drainage smell coming from the bathroom during the week we were there.","27581":"Our mini-apartment was in a fantastic position. Our balcony was (almost literally) hanging over the sea. The huge glass sliding door in the kitchen area allowed for wonderful views of the sea and the sunset. We were pleasantly surprised that the position was so excellent, since we were not sure if all the photos on the website were of the actual apartment views. Being right next to the sea covered up for some of the other unpleasantries (which I\u2019ll mention a bit further down). Our bedroom also had a sea-facing window and we slept with the window wide open, lulled by the sounds of the gentle waves lapping the shore below. It was awesome! We were also pleasantly surprised that despite the window being open and having no screen we had no problems with mosquitos. Our apartment had an entrance up over the rooftop the building, through a series of narrow stairways. Interesting layout, since the entrance was through the kitchen (basically a sunroom on the roof) and the bedroom and bathroom was down a narrow staircase below it. The apartments must have been restored fairly recently. Ours was in good condition. Although we had a very positive impression of the actual rooms, our general impression of the place upon arrival was NOT favorable. After parking in a bare-legal fashion till we were through with check-in, we proceeded on foot to find the residence entrance. We walked back and forth several times till a little old lady on a balcony pointed a crooked finger in the direction and said \u201cCielomare\u201d. The reason we hadn\u2019t seen it the first time is that there is barely any sign identifying it. After finding it, we did see a small plaque with the name on it, but it was certainly not very obvious. At this point we found ourselves in front of an entrance closed by a steel gate looking into a small courtyard. Since it was locked, we looked for a doorbell to ring. All the doorbells had strange-looking names but no mention of Cielomare. Then I noticed a phone number on the plaque. I called it, but got a message that the number was no longer active! We were about to ring one random doorbell when we noticed a pushbutton off to the side without a label on it. When we pushed it, we heard a doorbell sound somewhere in the courtyard. Ok. We waited. Nothing. After a minute we rang again and a young man came out after a while and invited us into the reception area. We were relieved to know he was running the reception at the hotel. He was very courteous and helpful and even gave us some practical suggestions of things to do or places to eat in Trapani, before showing us to our room. Check-out was also a bit of a surprise. We had though we would check out around 10, so maybe that is why no one warned us that in early morning there would be no one at the reception. When we decided to change our plans and leave before 8 am, we were surprised to find that there was no one around. We weren\u2019t sure what to do with the key. Fortunately we were able to get ahold of someone by phone and they instructed us to leave the keys in a mailbox that (strangely enough) was labeled with some unrelated business\u2019 name. I mention the initial difficulties and check-out issues only to point out that things are not always clear and travellers should be aware of this. I would advise calling ahead and just double-checking everything with the reception. Cielomare does not have parking, so if you come by car you must park on the street. We did not find parking on the narrow street of the hotel, so had to park the car in paid parking space on Lungomare Dante Alighieri. You don\u2019t pay between midnight and 8 am, but all other times it\u2019s 0.80\u20ac hr. Be careful to not park on the other side (in the port area) since they clean the streets overnight and will tow your car if it\u2019s left there. There are signs, but it may not be clear at first.","27590":"4 nights in Asdrubale, the apartment on the 3rd floor, many stairs but it's worthy. Marvelous balcony with view on the sea and on the right the Golfo Trapanese. It's a 2 bedrooms with kitchen, a small living room and a balcony with a table, 4 chairs and two sun beds apartment, really awesome. The kitchen isn't very good in my opinion, not cozy and poorly furnished. There are 2 bedrooms, one with a king size bed, very big and SUPER comfortable with a memory foam mattress, in the other room unfortunately is the mattress hard like wood, very uncomfortable to sleep on it. At the reception you will find Vincenzo,which is the nicest man in the world,always happy to help you. One day he was also lending us his car to drive around!! One word also about Veronica,the old dog whose always lying on the floor at the entrance, she really appreciates if you say hi to her! We had a lovely staying!","27647":"Extraordinary location in Trapani, in front of the Harbour. Very convenient to take the ferry to Favignana and levanzo in the morning. Downtown Trapani is reachable on foot. The rooms are modern, very clean and well-equipped (our flat had a kitchen, the bathroom was super clean and confortable). Moreover, the owners are very professional and ready to help and give advice. Strongly recommended. I'm going to be back for sure.","27650":"We spend 3 nights at Ciuri Home apartments during our visit of Western Sicily . The apartments are cozy , super clean and fully equipped . On top of that the hosts are very friendly and helped us a lot organzing our visit of Trapani . We loved the city and the weather was great even if it was January !","27651":"This is a great place for a stay in Trapani. The price of the apartments are cheap, our apartment had a bedroom with a doublebed, a little kitchen with everything necessary to cook and appliances like the Moka machine, and a little bad with shower. We were welcomed by Nicola e friendly receptionist who helped us with suggestions on what to do, maps, where to park, and so on. The bathroom is cleaned every day, and towels changed if you want. Internet speed is good.  There was a problem with the draining of the shower, I informed Nicola and it was repaired the same day. I found the location to be good too, you're in the port district, sure, but the ferry to the islands and the historic center can be reached in a few minutes by foot. I would stay again here in the future","27652":"Value for the money. Free parking in front of the building. It's a good location if you are in transit for one night between Sicily's zones.  No natural light in our rooms. We had to keep the window shutter closed because the window was very close to another room's window. Old furnishing, basic rooms.","27659":"Stayed here for 5 nights. Lovely light specious apartment with well equipped bathroom and kitchen. Right on port and close to centre of trapani. Recommend this place. Only downside is didn't get towels or bedding changed while we were there.","27660":"Nice and clean hotel. Location is 15 min from the center. Verry friendly reception with many tips for excursions. Next to a busy road but you wont hear the sound. Rooms can be noisy. There are many parkingplaces.","27677":"Nice and clean room, close to downtown, bus stops and really big supermarket. Bus stop for Palermo is also close to Cuiri Home. There was some salt, tea, coffee and even olive oil in the kitchen! Excellent place to stay!","27685":"I got a free update on the room, so I cant say about the cheapest option. But the room that i got was actually a apartament, super well done and clean. Loved the stay! And the Lady on the receptivo was super cute and polite!","27687":"We were very well received in Ciuri Home, nice appartment, modern and well organised. Good Quality Price ratio. 10 minutes walk to the sea and to the city. Kitchen is available and all stuff is ready to use.","27690":"Fair deal for the paid money. Very friendly staff. Also good location to travel with car from. Everything into the apartment is quite basic. Apartment is nice, large (for 2 persons in our case) and clean. However it does not has its own parking, thus you may face difficulties with street parking, especially during the summer season..","27693":"Stayed at Ciuri Home for 1 night. Very hospitable staff - they gave us a small guidebook about Trapani, Erice, explained what to visit, how to get there, were ready to answer any question. Location - great, 10 mins walk to the city centre, many restaraunts nearby, as well as a bus station. Room - great. Very cozy and clean. You'll find everything you need.","27694":"Excellent location, quiet street but very close to the historic center. Elevator inside the building, which is a big plus given it's age. The communication with the owner was excellent and the price fair enough.","27696":"Not complicated to arrive from airport with bus, and when I met receptionist Giusy, I received the most genuine welcome smile of all my travels. I felt at home before being given the keys to my rooms. Very clean, and spacious rooms, and situated right in the Port, not very far away from the centre.","27708":"This quaint B&B is located on the boundary of the old part of Trapani. Basic, but clean and staff friendly and helpful.  The port, where you get the boats out to the islands, is 5 minute walk. Similar there is a \u2018free\u2019 beach ~ 10 minutes away and entry into the wonderful maze of streets in old Trapani is just around the corner, where one is spoilt for choice in restaurants.","27715":"We stayed in this hotel for a one week vacation in May 2017. The hotel rooms are located in different houses all close to each other. The stuff was verry nice and really helpful. The room was very tiny, but clean and comfy. Breakfast had not too much to offer, but for the price we paid, it was allright. We would reccomend it, if you travel on a budget, but still want to stay at a hotel.","27718":"Cortile si Venere is located in the centre of Trapani! The rooms are clean, new, beatiful and cozy. The rooms are distributed in different buildings close to each other in the tiny streets typical of the city. Everywhere there is wifi working, personal super kind, welcoming and good taking care for any need! The breakfast is very good! We really enjoy our staying!","27785":"We stayed here for 3 nights as part of a tour. The hotel is in a good position with easy access to bars, restaurants, the harbour. We were pleased with the comfort of the rooms, spacious, comfortable beds pillows. The staff were friendly and helpful. There was a good choice at the buffet breakfast so we had everything we needed, no complaints at all!","27787":"We stayed here for 3 nights as part of a tour group. The room was clean and comfortable, only lacking in information regarding services available in the hotel, and we didn\u2019t spot any Fire escape information.... The breakfast was adequate, items ran out and were not always refilled. We didn\u2019t eat there in the evening but there were plenty of restaurants nearby. It was a good base to visit the various sites of interest in the locality.","27799":"The hotel is across from the railway station and within walking distance of the main road. WiFi was available with no problem connecting. The room we were allocated had a connecting door to the adjacent room, unfortunately, because of this, we could hear the people who were occupying the next room (especially the loud snoring). Breakfast was poor with the day that we left being extremely poor (we had an early morning start).","27804":"I have been to this hotel several times over the past year or so. There is no gym, None of the rooms have ironing facilities. Not all of the rooms have a kettle and the ones that do dont have coffee. Only tea so I tend to bring my own coffee making supplies with me now. What ever you do, dont drink the tap water, even though we are in Europe!! (See pic). That being said, the staff are usually friendly and helpful, the train station is right outside the hotel and town is within walking distance.","27809":"Three night Riviera Group Holiday Sept 18. Food awful. Riviera had booked 2nd & 3rd nights dinners out in local restaurants (excellent food) - they obviously were aware of the Chrystal's poor food reputation. Two tiny squashed lifts took 2 people & luggage. Not one drawer or cupboard for storage, wardrobe had 3 small shelves with safe taking up one. Lived out of suitcases! A C not efficient, asked for fan 3 times never came. No milk for provided tea & coffee, requested & promised 3 times never arrived. Shower had large gap all round flooding floor. No pool or beach. This is a one night business hotel, not for holidaymakers. AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE!","27813":"Good hotel with great breakfast. Location is perfect, free parking in the street and you can walk everywhere to eat. It is a tourist hotel, not trendy, but clean and comfortable. Service was also good.","27816":"We were part of a Riviera Travel group staying here for 3 nights. Hotel looks very smart and modern on the outside and has perfectly adequate rooms and accommodation and is in a quiet part of town despite being across the street from the rail terminus but which has very few trains. It is an easy walk into town through some very pleasant gardens for more restaurants and nightlife on Corsa Vittorio Emanuel. The walk in shower in the room was excellent and a safe is provided. Only problem with the room was the curtains were grubby and had come off the rail at one point and could not be fully closed. The breakfast had a good selection, but some items quickly ran out and did not get replaced in the time we had available which was an issue reported by others. Cutlery was hard to come by also.","27817":"Two or three nights is fine in this tourist comercial hotel when touring. Food is passable but lots of local restaurants within a short stroll. Do not leave anything in room when you leave! Aftet many phone calls and e-mails no one at the hotel was bothered to respond, very poor.","27821":"Visited a few times now, the hotel is clearly striving to be more modern but still is quite basic.  Rooms vary, but most are relatively plain, modern rooms with a stocked fridge, kettle and a safe.  Bathrooms are pretty modern, hair dryers are a little like having an asthmatic mouse coughing on you till your hair is dry so I recommend you bring your own if you\u2019re cursed with a lions mane of hair like myself.  If you\u2019re sharing a room, the two single beds provided were so close together you may as well be sharing a bed.  Overall the hotel is fine","27822":"Hotel is positioned outside the old town by the rail station and convenient for travel. We had a large comfortable room and a great bathroom with a large walk-in shower, excellent for anyone with mobility problems. We were with a large group and breakfast was a bit chaotic on the first morning. But this was sorted out by very helpful staff and we got a good breakfast with lots of choice. It is a walk into town but I would suggest eating lunch dinner there as there are good restaurants. The ice cream place round the corner from the hotel is good for a snack.","27832":"Stayed for a few days and liked the room, which was spacious but in need of some updating.The AC was tricky but eventually worked. Breakfast was good with quality products and a variety of hot and cold options. Unfortunately the coffee was surprisingly bad...especially for Italy. I cannot praise the staff enough. The two girls, Vittoria and Cristina, I think, at reception were charming and very helpful, courteous and knowledgeable as was our shuttle driver, Nicola, who also accompanied us on a tour of some really special places round Trapani. The location is excellent, near the train and bus station, the beaches and the lively old town with its bars and restaurants. Would defenitely stay there again.","27834":"The Crystal looks a bit brutal from the outside and it is not a hotel to chose if you wish to spend a lot of time in the hotel rather than out and about. However, it is very easy to walk through the old town, go to the beach or walk back after an evening meal out, which is a big plus point for its very central location. The staff were very pleasant and efficient and our bedroom large, comfortable, clean and quiet, even though our room faced the adjacent railway station. The room had several shelves as well as ample hanging space in the wardrobe, so we did not have a problem unpacking, unlike some other guests.The shower was huge and fierce - full marks for that - and the shower gel shampoo replaced on a daily basis Breakfast was fine: my husband particularly liked the fruit provided, especially the peaches. Our one dinner in the hotel was of a reasonable standard given the size of our group (49): it is simply unrealistic to expect the best Italian cuisine for large tour groups in this type of hotel. The bar (and barman) were fine when the bar were open - but it is certainly not a place you would chose to relax for an hour or two. On the whole however, the Crystal was of a comparable standard to most other 4 star hotels we have stayed in, in Italy: just be aware the standard might not be exactly what you would expect in the UK.","27837":"This hotel is centrally located near the train station and dozens of great restaurants and cafes. The service at the hotel is good and it has a boutique hotel feel. The rooms are not modern. It appears they are straight out of the late 80s or early 90s. However, I feel this is part of the charm. The rooms are super clean. The breakfast is also very good. I recommend this hotel for tourists and business travelers alike.","27838":"Close to the historical center. Easy place to park your car on the street near the hotel. Helpful staff. There are missing outlets for charging phones and other devices (cameras, PCs, etc). Modernized room. Missing luggage rack for the two suitcases of a couple. Cleanliness of the room and bathroom is good. Good breakfast, with good selection of breads, pastries, cheeses, sausages, fruits, coffees, etc.","27842":"The town of Trapani is an industrial port with but a small beach about 300m from this hotel. The town railway station lies next door but we were not disturbed by the infrequent trains. Just across the road lies a small shop selling inexpensive fruit & vegetables, water, crisps & wine. Room 411 was a corner room, reasonably sized & modern with twin beds, bedside tables, double settee pull-down bed, case rack, large TV on a table. The shower room had a super shower, sink, WC, bidet, hairdryer, tissues, plenty of towels and shower gel shampoo, all in red marble tiles. But for a stain in the middle of our bedroom\u2019s carpet, our room was cleaned & made-up daily. There were no drawers so one had to live out of a suitcase. We had a reasonable selection for breakfasts, Inc. bacon & scrambled eggs. We had one dinner here, which was strictly tourist menu.","27843":"A very good hotel for a short stay if visiting TRAPANI for pleasure or business.  The hotel is not provide the full range of hotel services for example the very small bar and dining area are basic and the bar is uninviting and closes at 9.00pm.  Join the throng in the evening by visiting a nearby bar or about 15m minutes walk to the lovely town centre WITH ITS MANY RESTAURANTS OFFERING INDOOR OR OUTDOOR DINING.","27845":"We stayed for 3 nights. Defiinately a business hotel very utilitarian. The food was awful so we ate out the other 2 nights. The position is great almost in the town so no taxi fares. No I wouldn't stay there again but it wasjust not what we hoped for.","27848":"The hotel is in a great location for the beach, the port and the old town. The beach is great and the old town is full of good places to eat and drink.  The hotel is predominantly a business hotel rather than a holiday location.","27849":"The Crystal Hotel is a very nice hotel. It is well located, 5 mins away from the old town. The breakfast is really good. The staff is wonderful and always willing to help you. My many thanks to Francesco (if I am not wrong - he is the one who drove us to the wedding and served our breakfast every morning). And also to the two ladies at the reception. The only negative side is the fact that the hotel is a bit noisy. You hear your neighbors if they are not quiet! Which is unfortunately complicated in Italy :)","27867":"We visited in the second half of November to learn about olive oil and how it's made. Giacomo of Elite Island tours organised a one day programe which included picking olives, a tour of an olive mill and storage plant and later a visit to a sea salt production plant and museum which is family run and a very friendly and passionate member of the family showed us a part of an old wind mill and explained the whole production process. The staff at Duca di Castelmonte is friendly and helpful and the food is exquisite.","27882":"We were a group of 22 old friends, celebrating birthdays. We stayed at Duca di Castelmonte for a week in September and thoroughly enjoyed it: the family atmosphere, the cordial and helpful staff, the food, the beautiful old estate and the surroundings. We had dinner at the place every night , and the food was absolutely excellent, like a 5 star gourmet restaurant.as someone said. Breakfast ample: not only wonderful homebaked croissants and cakes , but also eggs, youghourt, ham, cornflakes etc. They also arranged a wonderful gala dinner for us, and it was made an excellent and very memorable experience, - and not very expensive. The place was also very well situated for excursions. They helped us to get busses. A Sicilian Family agriturismo that showed all the best parts of Sicilian friendliness and Sicilian way of living Perfect for a group stay","27894":"Very relaxing, clean and helpful staff. Ample parking space. Although it is set in a very tranquil area, it is close to Trapani, Marsala and San Vito lo Capo. The food is very good especially the pizza which is cooked in a stone oven. A truly wonderful experience.","27907":"Great cosy agriturismo with friendly staff and also very good food! This is the place to be, if you are nearby Erice and Trapani!  Big clean rooms, and a nice swimmingpool!  Fantastic place to stay! This farm is highly recommended.","27909":"Laura was a wonderful host, giving helpful tips on places to see and suggested a day-long boat trip to the Egadi islands which is not to be missed. Great opportunities to swim from the vessel. No need to go out to dinner - the menu options are really diverse.","27911":"Luxurious tent with air conditioning, shower, wc, fridge and hob etc. Sleeping for 5 or 6. These were brand new and nice and roomy with massive external verandah area for dining or chilling out. The staff were terrific - couldn't do enough and the food was exceptional. One criticism maybe that to expect (non-italian) youngsters to sit at a dining table from 8-11pm while the banquet was consumed is asking a bit much! The pool and gardens etc were superb and fitting within this rural setting. Fantastic","28013":"Location and accommodation are very nice, especially the pool and garden area. Furthermore, the accommodation is only 15 minutes drive from the Trapani airport. The accommodation is also very reasonably priced. Perhaps the only downside of the accommodation is the breakfast, which has room for improvement. That said, I will still recommend this accommodation to friends.","28030":"We stayed here for three nights and found the hotel excellent. The room was large, clean and comfortable. The breakfast was more than adequate with croissants, toast, cold meats and cheese together with home made cake. Parking was very easy in the quiet dead end street. The advise on where to visit and local restaurants was excellent. I would recommend and return if in the area again","28200":"Accommodation is very well located, right in the centre. Also, very close to the harbour which was important to us. Free parking is around 1km far but that was fine for us, since many places don't have free spots at all close to the centre. Accomodation is perfeclty designed inside, with style which makes it more vozu. Room spacious,and very clean. Beds were very comfortable!! Host is always available and spoke nice English. Breakfast very nice.","28269":"I initially saw the B&B Ligny on tripadvisor but there were no English reviews so I was unsure to book it ... I am glad I did. We arrived at B&B after a short walk less than 5 mins from the bus stop at the port (the bus from Trapani airport leaves just outside it is branded AST - costs \u20ac4.50 pp and takes about 30 mins get off last stop at port). On arrival Gina the owner gave us a wonderful warm welcome, she has small bit of English and I had some Italian so we managed fine.  The whole place was fresh and spotless clean, very authentic. Bedroom was lovely and bright with high ceilings and a big window  door onto a small balcony where you could step out and view the sea. There was also air conditioning but we didn't use it we prefer to sleep with the window open. I was really comfortable staying here and it was nice and relaxed . Breakfast was 7:30 - 10:00 lovely fresh home made coffee and fresh bread, cakes, preserves, juice etc.  There is great hustle and bustle of the fish market close by in the mornings the port is only about 300 meters away so you can go there and see the fishermen selling the fresh fish - it is great fun . You can also take afew short steps outside you can sit and relax on the rocky shore and take in the sea and sun.  The B&B Ligny is a little outside the main tourist strip about 1k which I really liked - it was nice to have a stroll or cycle home. We rented bicycles for \u20ac9 per day and cycled all over the town. Theres lovely sandy beach a short distance away (10 mins relaxed cycling). We also took the cable car to Erice ...twice actually, for the second time we took our bikes up in the cable car and cycled back down the mountain. Less than 5mins walk away from B&B and not in the main tourist restaurant street is the very best authentic sicilian cuisine at Locanda Di Frati a MUST visit - check out reviews here on tripadvisor also. All in all a super 3 nights in Trapani the weather was great too :)","28370":"We arrived at near midnight, yet the welcome was first class. As the other reviewers have said, it is ideally located for the airport, yet you would not know, as it is very peaceful. Lookout for the hundred year old lemon tree!","28371":"We were warmly welcomed by our host who was kind and helpful. Quiet location in rural village near to Trapani airport. Homely private house with spacious public areas and lovely garden. Breakfast provided despite a very early departure.","28384":"Very comfortable coz its only 8km far from Birgi airport. You can pick up the rented car in the morning after breakfast and start touring the nice views of northern Sicily. But still worth it to spend 3 nights in triskele b&b. I recommended a lot to Maltese people for a weekend break. Only 20euro night ! !","28386":"Nice lovely place. Very quiet. We were there end of October, so the pool was just closed. Breakfast was good, good coffee and a variety of nice sweet pies. It is convenient located for Trapani airport, but you need a car to go there. From there it is very easy to visit Erice, Trapani, Mozia, Marsale. There is free wifi.","28387":"Stayed one night after arriving late to Trapani airport, before continuing the trip around Sicily. Very nice place. Clean, high standard, nice and helpful people and a cozy atmosphere.","28388":"B & B Triskele is in a beautiful location out in the counrtyside. It is very quiet no noise of traffic only birds singing in the early morning. It is not too far from Birgi, Trapani Airport and your car will be parked safely in the hotel grounds.","28390":"We stayed here the night before our early flight. The B&B is located in the middle of nowhere and the only way to get to it is by car or taxi which costs \u20ac30 from Trapani. BUT the 5 minuite taxi from the B&B to the airport COSTS ANOTHER \u20ac30!! as it comes from Trapani on the meter! We should have stayed in a nice hotel in Trapani and got a taxi to the airport next morning!","28391":"The hotel is a short drive from the airport, perfect for a one night stopover. Our host was welcoming and very helpful, particularly in providing our breakfast for a very early start the next day. The bed linen and towels were beautifully laundered and the rooms were very clean and quiet. We will definitely stay there again.","28595":"This is one of the best B&B I've ever had) very clean room and the most delicious breakfasts! The hosts are very cute and polite, always ready to help in any questions! I want to go back here again, thank you for the rest!","28617":"Staff is really nice and helpful. Breakfast was really good. Property is located in a residential area, at the suburbs of Trapani. You will have to drive to centre, but you will not experience any problems finding a place to park at the B&B (which should be an issue in the centre).","28623":"I stayed here for 2 nights and it was such a great deal. Mario and Nat picked me up from the train station and took me to the BB. The room was huge and with a private bathroom with a hair dryer! They also had shampoo and shower gel for you.  The bed was really comfortable and the area was really quiet. The room also had a mini fridge and a tv so it was nice to go to the market nearby to buy some food and have some munchies and COLD water for the next day.  Mario's cappucinos were the best I had in Italy. He is very friendly and drove me to the airport for a very early flight. Overall a great stay for me and I would definitely recommend staying here if you are in Trapani.","28624":"The Delle Palme BB in Trapani, Sciliy was clean, roomy and the proprietors extremely nice and helpful. The breakfast was good. The only drawback was that it is not so close to downtown Trapani and you have to take a bus to get there, and they do not run that frequently especially at night. Great place if you have a car because it is in a fairly quiet residential neighborhood.","28625":"This is such a great place to stay!!! Everything one could wish for hospitality much appreciated. Hosts help us a lot in planning the next stage of our trip. We have felt so much at home here!","28626":"This b&b has been a home away from home and i loved living life as an italian for the past few days. This is a very nice city with wonderful sights and beaches. All this area worths a visit. Erice is a fantastic middle-age town and islands are such a tropical sea. p.s. b&b is a 5 star place!","28627":"Very nice! the hosts were really friendly and helpful, proving us a lot of info. If you want to feel at home this is your place. we recommend it to everyone!","28654":"very special bed&breakfast in an old palazzo...wonderful rooms...very charming...highly recommandable !!!!!!","28664":"After visiting over 100 hotels I usually write a basic review, but in this case experience went completely on upper level \u2013 after booking we got clear instructions for parking, when we came to hotel, host Rosanna was really kind and help us with all informations \u2013 when we needed any info, she was checking and calling around. If we go back to hotel - rooms are really big, nice decorated and are real mixture of modern art and tradition. Hotel is located in the historic centre, so almost everything is at walking distance. You have different possibilities of parking near the hotel (South or North side of Trapani old centre - price 0,80 eur h or bigger parking at start of Trapani old town with price 0,10 eur h). Breakfast was nice, Rosanna made us bacon&eggs, there were also other pastries. During our stay my girlfriend had a birthday and Rosanna took a care for a cake, so everything was perfect \u2013 with big thanks to our host, who treated us like kings.","28665":"Fantastic B&B. Rosanna our host was attentive and friendly, spending ages taking us through restaurant recommendations and local sights. The room was beautiful, spacious, immaculately clean and full of art and design touches. The breakfast was lovely with excellent coffee, and eggs and bacon prepared to order. Only watch point is the staircase up to the rooftop breakfast may be difficult for infirm people as it\u2019s a very tight and steep spiral. The location is absolutely central. Just note that booking.com said there is parking, there isn\u2019t. We parked ten minutes walk away in a public car park for 10c per hour (not Sunday) which was no problem. I\u2019d highly recommend this place, and it was a friendly and professional service from Rosanna throughout.","28666":"This review is long overdue. My husband booked two rooms at Cantiere dell'Anima in May for our daughters and friends. The location is great and the hotel is absolutely lovely with beautiful works of art on every wall. It was like staying in an art gallery. The rooms were large and very comfortable and the best part was the ever-helpful Rosanna who helped our friends plan outings and gave recommendations for restaurants. She also laid out beautiful and delicious breakfasts for our group. We would not hesitate to stay here again!","28700":"This place was a really good find. Just minutes walk away from all the sights and restaurants, yet in a very quiet street. The room was simple yet beautiful and very large, with a good sized bathroom. Water, tea, coffee and biscuits were supplied free of charge.\nThe breakfast was excellent. Fresh croissants, breads and pastries, homemade cakes and cannoli, very good coffee and anything else you could want. The staff is extremely nice and helpful, and couldn't do enough for you. I highly recommend this place and would definitely stay there again.","28784":"the best one can get for this price! every thing was excelent.warm attitude from Mauru the owner so we felt like at our house.very clean ,wonderfull location,quiet and very nice design ,every room is different.big comfortable bedand rich braekfast.","28789":"This B&B hotel is 5-10 min from the old town. It is modern and clean. The host had probably the best communication I have ever encountered, asking us when we will be arriving etc. Of course, in a typical Italian manner, the host\u2019s agent messed up by switching off the phone and being late but, it is ok \u2013 it worked out. The rooms are clean, we had a standard one \u2013 it is not the biggest and has windows facing an internal courtyard wall. But, one does not stay in Palermo to stay in the room. The attached bathroom is very nice. The breakfast is typical Italian, cakes and some savoury bread with coffee \u2013 one of the best we had on this trip. There is internet. The only complain would be that some of the other guests were noisy into very late hours and the doors are not really soundproofed. The host also helped with parking, which is in a hotel on the opposite side of the street. Word of caution for drivers. There is a congestion zone (ZTL) that might end up being expensive if you do not pay attention. Fortunately, this place is outside of it. A second caution for non-Italian drivers, in Palermo traffic rules seem to be optional. People will do silly things so be prepared (like double parking)!","28803":"I am trying to choose carefully my words to try to express my gratitude to Stefania who hosted us at Amuri with lots of Amore and availability. The place was really nice, quite, clean and spacious. The location was exceptional. The beds were comfortable the bathrooms were modern and chic. On top of that you add Stefania\u2019s homemade cakes at breakfast her smiling face and her availability, what a better place can one wish for yourself and your family. Grazie Stefania for a wonderful stay.","28813":"What a find in Palermo! This B and B, right near many of Palermo's most noteworthy sights, is lovely. The hosts - and I was in contact with Erica in particular - are lovely and very helpful with all kinds of things - directions, taxi reservations, restaurant recommendations. The room I stayed in was spacious, very clean, and charming.\n\nThis place has the best of both modern luxury and old-world charms. Highly recommended!","28815":"First of all, how do you correct a listing on TripAdvisor? Aquarooms does NOT have FREE PARKING. Just because you could be lucky, and be able to read Italian and find some parking on a street nearby, does not mean that a hotel has parking... which, sadly, was the reason we CHOSE the hotel, as we were worried about where to park our rental car before starting our tour of Sicily.\n\nIn any case, there is a garage near the station about a 5 minute walk away, and we paid our 16 euros for overnight parking. The other thing is that it was quite difficult to navigate getting there by car, and our friend in Palermo helped us to buy a day permit to drive in the old city, and has hopefully fixed the situation where we drove into the old city to get to the hotel without a permit (and were likely photographed by traffic cameras).\n\nHaving thought about that: if you've got a rental car and need a place to stay in Palermo, I'd say find somewhere else that's easier to get to and to park.\n\nBUT: that situation doesn't stop me from giving this small B&B\/hotel a good review. The room was quite beautiful actually, with high ceilings, quirky artwork and nice design. There are only a handful of rooms, which gives the place a nice quiet and exclusive feeling. We had a corner balcony out to the street, which was quite charming, and the double-glazed windows meant that it wasn't too noisy. The bed was comfortable. We liked the spa. The shower with the huge rain head (and two spouts from the wall!) is a good idea, but the water pressure in the hotel (and Italy?) isn't strong enough to really make this effective.\n\nCheck-in was a little confusing, so we didn't get the nice welcome and hospitality that other reviews have mentioned but it was fine. When I found out the breakfast part of the B&B was at a restaurant a few blocks down, I expected a hole in the wall, but loved the cafe, and found it stylish indeed. Ah, and the location is great, making it easy to walk to the sights. It also wasn't a cheap place to stay... but overall I found it closer to \"very good - 4 stars\" than \"average - 3 stars\".","28859":"My daughter book this place with my credit card and I had no clue on what to expect. It is located on a side street not much traffic very quiet. My daughter had the larger room and my wife and I had the smaller. Was very unique and homey. The bathroom was separated but private to us only. They do serve breakfast here.","28862":"We booked 3 months upfront a room with internal bathroom and terrace. This was confirmed by mail by Davide (part-time assistant working in the B&B), as well pictures were provided as we really wanted to have a terrace to sit, have breakfast and also to have the ease of having a bathroom in the room.\n\nFirstly, communication with Davide was extremely terrible. Both my girlfriend and I tried to book a room \/ get confirmation of prepayment \/ questions about parking, but responses came not at all or with a huge delay (after multiple repeat emails). We never had such bad communication with a B&B or hotel in all over the world.\n\nWe arrived on my birthday at the B&B, we were shown the room, but it was not the room we booked - there was no internal bathroom (you need to pass a public space including reception to go to the toilet or shower), no terrace and a window to the big streets (while the other room we requested is at the quiet back side).\n\nDavide said the owner booked the wrong room (although they confirmed the room reservation clearly by mail).\nEven worse, they explained that we got upgraded...by getting an external bathroom and no terrace???\n\nMistakes can happen, but we asked a solution.\nThe solution proposed was:\n- you pay the full price of the room you originally booked or\n- you go somewhere else to search for accommodation at 9PM.\nIf you talk about hospitality...\n\nWe were so disappointed, but even more disappointing is that nor Davide nor the owner tried to soften the situation or try to find another solution.\n\nAlso, the external bathroom (if you would consider to book this room) does not look like on the pictures of the website or booking.com. It\u2019s small and old.\n\nOh yes, if you think breakfast is served in the B&B on the terrace as mentioned on the website, it\u2019s not the case. You get a ticket for a bar. So don\u2019t rely on it.\n\nMy advice: don\u2019t rely on these people and they don\u2019t care about you if you\u2019re a foreigner. So watch out.\n\nFor Davide - Luca: you can reply on my message and try to look good. But you absolutely destroyed our Palermo experience by your truly unfriendliness, no hospitality and no service at all. You should be ashamed of yourself and you\u2019re a blame on the Sicilian image!\n\nA final quote: Davide mentioned he doesn\u2019t care about reviews put on tripadvisor from guests... they really don\u2019t care about the guest experience","28864":"We (a couple) stayed in the B'n'B for 5 nights in late June. The location is amazing, its perfectly situated for everything, the main sights, the markets, the station and the bus stops. It meant that going out in the evening for drinks or dinner was so easy and could nip back whenever and due to its location, getting lost was very hard to achieve. The rooms were very clean and the room we stayed in was huge. It had a TV which was useful to watch the World Cup. The 2 hosts were amazing, they were very friendly and funny, and were around to answer whatever questions we asked and gave some great advice about the city and what to do\/ where to eat. The room that we had (unlike the others) did not have an ensuite, but it did have a private bath room just outside the room. This wasn't a problem for us but may be for others, so make sure to get one of the other rooms if this may bother you. There was no longer breakfast in the B'n'B like people said before. Instead we were given vouchers for a local cafe to get breakfast each morning. We as a couple really liked this as we got a really nice coffee and a pastry each morning in the sun and got to eat it in a nice local Italian cafe. Make sure to have the Sicilian breakfast when there, it is a must!\n\nOverall we had an amazing trip and the accommodation that we had played a big part in this. Would highly recommend for couples, small groups and solo travellers. For how much it cost it was great value.","28874":"Nice large room with a separate sitting area and storage nook, bathroom large and if you're happy to walk a couple of steps down the hall outside the room is no problem. Coffee machine and fridge very handy! Luca was a great host. Breakfast was good enough! Quiet but accessible location. Thanks for a great stay!","28893":"This gem is perfectly located adjacent to the Teatro Massimo, near all 3 major downtown markets and within easy walking distance of the stunning Palatine Chapel.\nBeautiful, spacious ensuite room with large, relaxing balcony. Super, basic breakfast served in your room. Welcoming, friendly staff topped off our great stay. Delightful!!!","28920":"A 3 night stay in a spacious, clean and comfortable room(204). A warm and friendly meeting with useful information and local map was great. Bed large and comfortable, wardrobe safe excellent free WiFi and an amazing shower. A small balcony was a welcomed bonus and useful drying area for hand washing. Didn't use the basement whirlpool and sauna not time but a useful add on. Breakfast was simple and more than adequate eggs booked, scramble or poached with fresh coffee. Discounted meals at some local restaurants was also offered. A lovely little BnB.","28922":"Highly recommend this hotel. Special mention to the staff who could not be more helpful.\nClean quiet modern rooms with on site parking. Easy walking distance to points of interest in the city.\nCould not ask for more","28924":"The rooms are very comfort, the location is close to the city center and the marina. The staff is very very polite and helpful. Breakfast is all right. The furniture is new and hotel rooms are according to standards. The bed is also comfort. Wi-fi is amazing, and cover all areas.\nThe breakfast area is very tight and narrow, which is also the reception area.","28925":"Yes: Friendly staff. Bathroom spacious and modern. Great shower cubicle. Small fridge with a few complimentary items. Mid point between the old and new city and most sights within easy walking distance.\n\nMaybe: The immediate neighbourhood does not have much character. The room is not as big as it looks. Breakfast is limited but sufficient. Only offered coffee once! Perhaps they ration the coffee!\n\nNo: The towels are threadbare and hard. If you do not want extreme exfoliation, bring your own. Booked a room with a balcony....what a waste of time. It looked over the inner courtyards of neighbouring buildings that can best be described as a slum. So beware!","28928":"Nice and clean, conveniently located just outside the historic center of Palermo. Quiet at night when the balcony doors were closed.\nSpacious bathroom is newly renovated, the shower cabin has excellent water pressure, stable temperature, and multiple settings. The room has an air conditioner, mini fridge with complementary water bottles, kettle and tea bags. There are good options for breakfast, like fresh fruits, fresh bread rolls, cheese, meats and various sweets. We enjoyed our stay.","28929":"It\u2019s always a little more difficult when there isn\u2019t a formal reception area but the young lady that checked us in was very nice and helpful. Gave us a cup of coffee and a map with dining recommendations. Never could figure out how to work the AC properly but overall a nice place to stay.","28938":"Excellent B&B, incredibly friendly staff, clean and modern facilities including a jacuzzi, quiet yet central location, convenient for markets, churches and restaurants. What more do you need. Value for money! Fully recommended.","28944":"This small B&B was a great find. It was right between old city and new city. We could walk to everything. It was close to a bus line (the 101). We walked to the harbor, and all of the old parts of the city. Luigi spent considerable time suggesting things for us to see. The staff was available all of the time to answer questions. The breakfast was good even though the room was a little small. The room itself was a good size with a large bathroom and great shower. The bed was generally comfortable although I found the pillows very hard. All in all a great place to stay.","28946":"We stayed here for two nights and were absolutely blown away by the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff. My wife accidentally tore a 50 euro note and they took her to the bank to sort it out. The rooms were spacious, the bathrooms spotless and overall the place was fantastic","28948":"Secure parking, excellent breakfast, charming staff. Roberta made us very welcome in perfect English as soon as we arrived. She outlined all that we should do during our stay and recommended two places to eat which were both perfect. They even lent us an umbrella when we had a little rain one morning. Would recommend this accommodation to anyone.\nAbout 5 minutes from the Marina and easy access to the old town, it is located in an ideal position.","28950":"Just outside the old town and an easy 10 minute walk to Politiama square. Very clean and new. We stayed in an apartment on the 4th floor which was very quiet and were able to sleep with all windows open although you could use the efficient air conditioning.\nBreakfasts were ample with plenty of choices.\nLovely people and always ready to help.","28951":"The location was very far from the center of town and the taxi couldn't even find it. Mold in the shower and poor quality towels which are stiff, rough and dry. The fridge did not work and they never fixed it. We were promised an upgraded room due to our dissatisfaction with the B&B but they did not provide it. We tried to cancel the rest of our 7 day stay but they were so greedy they refused to allow us to leave. We were treated very disrespectfully and bullied by the manager and we were forced to stay or lose our money. Caveat emptor: never book a stay longer than a couple of days before checking it out in person first. We were extremely disappointed at the low quality for our money at this property. We could have paid the same for a 4 star hotel and stayed in a better room and hotel. B&Bs are overcharging these days and you are better off in a 4 star hotel for the price. The staff is much more professional in real hotels, not like here where they yell at you and tell you you are crazy for making a complaint.\n\nAlso a big safety issue with the emergency pull cord located by the toilet, outside of and far from the shower.","28952":"We are on our last night at this B&B and I can't find a fault.\nThe room is spacious and modern with a great bathroom and air con.\nThe staff are brilliant, helpful and attentive.\nThey have lots of advice on where to go and what to see and have access to bookings for kocal tour services\nThe breakfast room is well stocked in the morning with plenty of choice.\nLocated near to the old town and everywhere is accessible on foot.\nNo complaints at all.\nGive this place a try!!","28954":"Absolutely perfect, clean, brand new, nice and helpful staff. Very small B&B perfectly located to visit downtown Palermo. Rooms are newly furnished, as the entire building, including the lift. Parking space available for some 5 cars.\n\nThe B&B occupies nearly all the floors of the building. Little jacuzzi room available for free, and also a bathroom to wash on the day of check out, so that you can leave the room in the morning, spend your last day in town and come back to refresh yourself before leaving. Good & quiet sleep.\nNicely prepared breakfast.\nRoom 103 door is on the breakfast room, so if you want to sleep until late in the morning better choosing another one.","28986":"I had reserved our stay with a 50 percent down payment by wire transfer. I was hesitant to make the transfer as this is not how I am used to making reservations but seems typical for the B&B's in Sicily. Our trip was cancelled due to Covid 19. I can't review the room but can say that Manuela at the B&B was very helpful in making the reservation and when asked to provide a refund for the down payment was not hesitant to wire a refund back to my account. Given the chance to visit in the future I wouldn't hesitate to make another reservation with the B&B","29001":"This place is amazing and a real surprise as soon as you step through the gates into a little paradise. Super quiet but really close to the beach and some fantastic restaurants. The rooms are big and stylish with everything you need (inc Netflix) and lots of outdoor space for relaxing in. Breakfast was delicious... I cannot rate this place higher and will be back! Grazie Manuela!","29045":"Booked in for 4 nights but bumped to next door Hotel Joseph run by owners brother on arrival supposedly because of plumbing problems. So I can't rate service etc but the location is good and the replacement hotel was nominally equivalent. It is just a short walk from the Station on via Roma just past Lidls,    ","29081":"This was one of the most spacious and well appointed rooms in two months travel through Italy.\n\nIt was so easy to find and just 5 min from train\/bus station.\n\nBring earplugs as it's a main road, and like most Italian houses and hotels, walls are paper thin and tile floors echo.\n\nDon't be too paranoid about theft in Palermo, the natives aren't. Just a modicum of care will do.","29083":"Geat place if you travel on a tight budget. However, all rooms share bathroom so during season it may be a bit of a problem. It's not independent so you will not get a key - always needed to buzz so felt bad about waking everyone up after 10pm. Pretty basic but cosy. But the morning cappuccino served by mama was the best!","29085":"We had a great night at D'Angelo's it was lovely and clean and the staff were very friendly (though we don't speak Sicilian and they didn't speak much English we communicated fine). Breakfast was very nice.\n\nI would recommend to friends and family.","29089":"My boyfriend and I arrived in Palermo at 8.30pm after flying in following a wonderful few days in Rome and I must say the hotel's location was very easy to find- about 10 min walk in stright line from the train station. However upon arriving we were informed that we had no booking. We showed them the booking confirmation print out and he wondered off into another room when we then heard loud arguing, then he returned to tell us a room would be ready in a few minutes and did we want to go and eat and come back later, which after a long day (I am pregnant so just wanted to sit down) we didn't want to do. He then disappeared into the room again, where we heard further loud arguing.\n\nUpon his return he told us (in very broken english- which is fair enough, but didn't help the situation) we would need to go to a hotel over the road, he would negotiate the same rate for us, but we would have to pay him in cash now. We were not keen on handing over money upfront for a hotel we had not seen or heard of & explained we would go and see it then if happy come back and pay him. He did not like this one bit. He began to 'have a paddy': threatening to tear up our reservation, telling us we paid now or we would have no place to stay tonight, he would phone the other hotel and tell them not to take us etc etc. It really felt quite threatening- and I'm not easily threatened. We grabbed the reservation form from him and essentially got out as fast as we could.\n\nI would never go back, which is a shame as the reviews of it had been ok. Hopefully we ust caught him on a bad day. However, I can recommend Hotel Concordia for a cheap and cheerful night's sleep instead!","29106":"It was perfect, absolutely amazing. The staff were so friendly and polite. The room was so clean and comfortable. Great location and good service! Moreover I really enjoyed the breakfast. I had a perfect night and you might have so. Don\u2019t miss it","29192":"We booked two rooms for two nights here last October. Since we had a rental car and had been warned about Italy's ZTL laws, we checked the map for Palermo and found that Cassaro 261 is inside the restricted traffic zone. We wrote to them well in advance (several times) and gave them the details of our car so that they could register it as a hotel guest vehicle. They eventually replied to the effect that it was ok or taken care of.\n\nOur stay there was fine ... it was a bit hard to find, being on the third floor of an apartment building with no signs to let you know where they are, but the rooms were nice and the breakfast good. The first surprise was when we went to check out and discovered that their credit card machine was \"broken\", so we had to unexpectedly shell out 350 euros in cash.\n\nThe second and nastier surprise came 6 months later when we got notification from our car rental company that we had been fined 160 euros by the city of Palermo for driving in the ZTL and on top of that were billed 71 euros as a service charge by them. The infraction location was on the main street a couple of blocks from the hotel.\n\nI wrote to Cassaro and asked for them to rectify the ticket and reimburse the 71 euros but never got a reply. I don't know why they lied about the ZTL ... perhaps they are flying under the tax radar or there was some expense involved, but in any case, if you are traveling by car I would strongly urge you to avoid this hotel","29194":"It was a basic room but it was clean in a nice location. Continental breakfast was served with fruit, yogurt, coffee, granola bars etc. The owners were helpful with giving us directions and helping us to buy tickets to attractions.","29283":"Stayed in this B&B for 3 nights , February 2013. Good location between Via Macheda & Via Roma, just along from Teatro Massimo. Large spacious room, good value for money. Typical Sicilian breakfast, cakes pastries etc, very tasty (unless you aren't diabetic I guess :)) Chiara is so helpful - full of information on Palermo , she searched opening times on the internet for me. Nothing was a problem for her. Would love to return some day.","29291":"Thanks to excellent service, perfect location, very good food, fantastic rooms, sweet personell, and many other things, this B & B made us feel very special and did contribute a lot for us to having the best days ever in Palermo....all in all: FANTASTIC PLACE :-) I can highly recommend this place to anyone, families, couples, singles, old and young people...very very good! :-)\nEnjoy","29300":"Stayed here April 2018, in the Jr. Suite. Spacy room with not much furniture, but ok-ish. Bed was fine, toilet didn't have enough power to flush, will spare you the details. The toilet seat was broken and really cheap material. The shower was as flumsily attached although there was enough room to do it properly. Strange and uncomfortable. Water supply sucked in air from somewhere making the shower and flushing experience noisy and the temperature of the water, in the shower, fluctuate.\nMany lights were broken. All in all not in good maintenance,\n\nWat irritaed us the most however was the (lack of) cleaning of the room. After our first night, the room wasn't cleaned at all and after complaining the best we could get was a set shower towels and a set of napking to be used as ordinary towels. After the first night our bed was made but the room wasn't cleaned and we never got enough towels. Complaints didn't help and were simply responded to with a shrug.\n\nWe didn't take the hotel breakfast as there are plenty of place around that serve nice breakfast. For the rest there is no service in the hotel, although they can supply drinks at ridiculous prices. There is no refrigerator in the room.\n\nStill, location is in the heart of historic center and the Jr. Suite is nice. If you can live with no service, it may not be to bad.","29302":"When we arrived at the hotel, it was difficult to locate the hotel, we expected to find a normal hotel door, we finally found a large gate and noticed that it was an old building, I confess that we were scared, we entered through the discovery and adventure. (Photo 1)\n\nMy god we up started up the stairs because we already knew that there is no elevator, we finally found the hotel on the last floor of the building, the hotel is located on the second floor and because this is an old house, it means that you climbed up to the four or five floors until you reach the top floor we noticed that the building is abandoned, very po everywhere, very dirty and very old too. This hotel in Alessandra is not very advisable and inaccessible, to get elderly, people with reduced mobility or families with children, because as there is no lift, you would have to climb all the way to the entrance of the hotel (every time you leave, including lunch and dinner). (Photos 2. 3. 4. 5. 6)\n\nwe arrived at reception to check in, where the receptionist came to inform us that he had charge us a tax for each day staying at the hotel, my astonishment of the unpleasant situation that was happening soon upon my arrival at the hotel, and of course I refused to pay because In my booking I made on booking.com it was very clear the following information: (PRICES WITH ALL COSTS INCLUDED APPROX. \u00a3000.00, THIS VALUE INCLUDES TAXES DEFINED BY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS OR SPECIFIC COSTS COLLECTED BY ACCOMMODATION)\n\nOf course I would not accept this value. because I was not go to pay twice and I had to explain several times and also show my reservation to the receptionist so that I could solve the situation that was being created.\n\nThe other day, another receptionist in the morning came and gave me the document for me to sign as I did not want to pay this accommodation tax.my astonishment of the situation, how the hotel solves the situation as if it were me the culprit, the bad of this story is mine that did not want to pay.The Hotel Alessanda has to be more careful with the contracts that it makes with the other companies, much lack of hotel information. Incredible (Photo 7)\n\nWe finally received the keys to our bedroom, myself and my work colleague, our amazement that the receptionist informed us that he could only give us a room key and not two, my god how can this be, it is increditavel, there were many headaches, organizing with my colleague the exits of the hotel due to keys, could not be trusted if there was always someone in the reception of the hotel, as the property is very poor, not having the money to have other keys to the rooms of their guests. They gave us a key in a keychain of those of platico that is used in the office, horrible...\n\nMy stay was horrible, My God, I've never been in my life with very cold in that Hotel, there were no heater and if there were they were all disconnected, everywhere that steady at the hotel was cold, could not stand for long. The Hotel can be very cool in the summer because it is almost all made of stone on the ground, but in the cold season it is a big ice that can not be there and does not have a good system to heat the hotel.One day I found a receptionist all rolled up with very cold in the reception, care of the staff that works with those conditions of work. (Photo 8,)\n\nI noticed that the hotel had those air-conditioning systems, but is just to cheat, because I never felt worked, always turned off because hotel was freezing every day that I was staying, OMG (Photo 8 A )\n\nWhen we have entered for the first time in the bedroom, I can see that the last guest was staying in that room, big hair for any bedroom.\n\nIt's disgusting to see that, This is unacceptable for a hotel, very weak your cleaning system (Photo 9 )\n\nI' ve never seen, Not fixed on the floor, a toilet, with silicone.It's usually is get with large screws and not with silicone.. Every time we were going to the bathroom we had to be very careful not to fall. This situation is horrible. (Photo 10 )\n\nin my bedroom it was very complicated, because almost everyone when traveling at work like me, has to shitck on his cell phone, his computer and much more..\n\nbecause all the electrical outlets in the bedroom are occupied, one with the TV, another with the bed light, there is nothing for you to connect ... or you are prepared to bring one of these triple that you connect several at the same time. The most invincible of all, where I went to find a place where I could connect my computer or my cell phone, an electrical outlet near the ceiling of the bedroom, I needed a ladder so I could get there... how can this be, this is crazy, can not believe (Photo 11, 12 )","29306":"Hotel is fine for basic needs of bed,shower and breakfast. But consider 2 VERY LONG flights of stairs to drag your bags. No elevators!!!! Two young men did come to help after 1.5 flights completed. Other travelers describe fancy decor.... it's. Classic old world Italian. Ornate for American taste.","29307":"Interesting and fancy room; bathroom was ok; lighting not so good. Staff was friendly and accommodating.The entrance to the hotel is awkward, as there is a door within a huge gate. Breakfast was adequate.","29312":"This was a nice inexpensive hotel in a great location within walking distance of most of Palermo's famous sights, and walking distance to Train Station (10 minute walk). Nice old furnishings, two great common rooms for reading, relaxing, watching TV . Breakfast was OK .. Wifi was a problem, often didn't work. Doesn't work in your room at all, and if you're lucky, it \"MIGHT\" work in the common rooms.\n\nThe Staff is great and very friendly. Giovanni and Marco were warm and wonderful.","29374":"A family-run hotel that has been in the family for decades, Hotel Italia offers a place to stay that is full of old-world charm and current day comforts, including air conditioning and an elevator that takes you up to the hotel on an upper floor. The rooms are simple and elegant and comfortable. The host speaks English and is happy to help with any questions. The hotel is on a main street, which makes it very convenient, and at the same time it's very quiet for a wonderful night's rest. In my experience, Palermo B&Bs on higher floors sometimes do not have an elevator, but Hotel Italia does, and the elevator has terrific ironwork flower detail. The location is great with the Central Train Station just down the street, and there are many, many Palermo sites within walking distance, including one of my favorite's, the Pretoria Fountain. This hotel is especially perfect if you're traveling solo and looking for a spot that feels safe and welcoming. I highly recommend this special place.","29383":"It was late and I was too tired to check any further so I accepted the room even though it was fetid. The staff was really kind trying every possible way to fix things by bringing us detergents and products. (It's not the employee's fault that the owner offers substandard accommodations )\nThere was no toilet seat and he got the problem solved in the next afternoon. (Refer to photo) lights without light bulbs. (refer to photo), faulty shower door. Headboard merely leans on the wall hence knocking it whenever one moves in bed. A double glazed window would be nice, since the room is facing the main road where police sirens come quite often. The linens are clean, the floor is spotless.\nIf a hotel of the same level in Lisbon charging \u20ac23 can offer more comforts yet without the above mentioned defects then at \u20ac50 a night, this hotel can definitely do more.","29384":"after being turned away from our confirmed booking via booking com at B&B Liberty Teatro Santa Cecilia , we looked for a nearby affordable hotel.\nWe enquired at Hotel Italia Palermo and were welcomed and provided a room with no problem. Their room rate was even cheaper than the BnB we had booked. The staff couldn't have been more helpful, providing helpful advice on restaurants and taxi service.\nThey even helped me track down a lost IPhone left in a taxi and expressed posted to my home address in Australia. So grateful and appreciative Thanks to the staff !!!","29446":"The property has a good central location, but the rooms were very average and the bed was hard and uncomfortable. The bathroom had LOTS of hair on the floor and in the tub. Yuck. Staff was friendly and accommodating. Breakfast was okay. Nothing special.","29450":"very comfortable and easy--extremely helpful staff-- they were always attentive and made you feel at home. The room was clean, comfortable, and had a nice shower and bath tub. Fresh breakfast with yummy baked goods as well as eggs, yogurt, fruit. The 15 euro\/day parking garage was extremely helpful.","29453":"The staff welcomed us with a very warm greeting. We stayed for five nights in November. The location was very convenient to the sites, wonderful selection of restaurants in walking distance and attentive to parking our rental car.","29455":"I had 2 large picture windows, so good views out to downtown Palermo. Hotel is well kept, with an expansive breakfast, and on a corner so is easy to find. One block from modern upscale shopping, 15minute walk to old section.","29458":"Excellent location in the heart of the upscale shopping area. Near to the opera house and decent restaurants.\nTypical size rooms for a downtown, city, hotel. Staff, was nice enough. Certainly not over the top. Breakfast was a weak point. Staff very nice, offerings relatively sparse. Bar run on request. Parking is interesting, across the street, in the basement of a building, and you better know how to handle your vehicle. The spots are tight and require substantial maneuvering.","29459":"I stayed for 6 nights in October. Location good near city center and with many (at evenings) places to eat and drink, and still not much disturbance at nighttime. The hotel staff very friendly and ready to meet all my wishes. I had a rather small single room, but it was up to my needs. The bed was good and well siced. Breakfast nice, with many choices of cold food. Nice coffee prepared beforehand, but also possible to order fresh made espresso. No problems to order fried eggs and bacon.","29460":"I stayed here for 3 nights. Location was convenient to sites-about 10 minute walk from the pedestrian area\/markets. The only gripe was that the shower did not have suitable glass to keep water from spraying all over. My brother's room had no problems with shower\nHowever, breakfast was very good. The staff was extremely helpful and accomodating","29461":"Location: Really handy for the Politeama shuttle\/transfer bus stop to and from Palermo airport and within easy walking range of most of old Palermo's sights. Surprisingly for a city centre hotel, not too much external noise\nFacilities: Apart from a bar, lounge and brilliant roof top terrace the hotel has no other facilities on site.\nBreakfast: Nothing special.\nService: Very good.","29462":"Not to be recommended for solo travellers. This hotel caters mainly for US tourist groups and is pretty dead during the day. It is quite far from the historical centre. Taxis in Palermo are expensive and wherever you go will cost Euros 15 and you need taxis all the time. Bar service slightly irregular. When I arrived close to 11 pm I could not get an alcoholic drink. Breakfast room in basement is rather stifling although food adequate.\nReception service top class and rooms extremely comfortable.","29464":"Good position in central Palermo. Comfortable room but smallest shower I've ever seen. Less than 60cms square it was a logistical nightmare washing anything lower than your navel. Average breakfast and although the hotel advertises it's own car park, it doesn't mention the \u20ac15 a day fee until you get to the reception.","29467":"The hotel is in a great location and only 10 minutes' walk from the centre of Palermo's shopping area.\nIt is in a quiet location and, in combination with the comfortable room, we had a great night's sleep.\nBreakfast was delicious and very informal.\nOnly gripe was with the mini-bar - when you have paid a lot for the room it would be nice to at least have some complimentary water and snacks (to be fair this is not uncommon with most hotels in Italy)","29468":"Hotel was located in the city center but could be very noisy at night. I stayed there while on business and room was too small and desk not comfortable for working. Breakfast was good and staff friendly. Parking nearby.","29471":"We had a very comfortable stay. The staff was friendly and all spoke english. The location was an easy walk to the ferry terminal and many attractions. Our room felt a bit tight, but the bathroom felt large. The bed was very comfortable. I would happily stay here again.","29473":"Great location, very helpful staff, very efficient. Organized a breakfast box to take to the airport as we were leaving very early. We were with a group so on the last night would have been good to stay up and have a few drinks at their bar but no one around. We had a key not a card to our room which meant that when we handed in the keys they would shut down the aircon. We then had to ask them to switch it back on but they did very quickly.","29474":"The most amazing people work here! Once again, I was thoroughly amazed at their attention to details and overall kindness. Gaetano successfully guided me through the parking garage experience and when I asked if my daughter and I would be safe collecting the car at 4:30 a.m. on the day of departure, he said \"NO\" He immediately conveyed to the manager and it was decided that my car would be moved the evening before and that I would park directly in front of the hotel. There was a person at reception when I checked out, as well, which was comforting.\nThe terrazza is perfect for an apertif or late night glass of wine, as is the intimate bar on the ground floor. The breakfast is one of the finest I have had in Palermo. I was very appreciative also because it was my daughter's first trip to Sicily and I wanted it to be special. I live in Sicily and have stayed in many hotels in Palermo and the most outstanding characteristic is the people that work there. I look forward to a return in the fall when the hammam opens and Teatro Massimo beckons.\nGrazie Mille\nDiane Johnston DiNatale","29475":"Good stay with good breakfast and nice rooms. Close to the center with many historical sites and many good restaurants. Parking opportunities at the hotel garage, and good parking possibilities also outside the hotel.","29476":"Stayed here for 2 nights at the end of a 2 week tour of Southern Italy and Sicily. The location is good....close to shopping and restaurants. The staff was friendly and the men working the bar were amazing. The breakfast area was tiny and the offerings small, but you can get by. One huge thing for us that we loved about this hotel was that the AC in our room worked great! The best of all the hotels we stayed at this trip! The main down fall and why we rated it 3 stars is the electrical outlet situation. First of all there are no plugs or USB ports near the bed. There is only 2 plugs in the entire room. My biggest issue was that there is no plug in the bathroom for a curling iron\/flat iron. You have to use one of the 2 plugs on the desk for these, but there is no mirror except in the bathroom....how can I curl my hair with no mirror? This is a major flaw. If you aren't going to have a plug in the bathroom....at least have a mirror by the plug you do have. Extremely inconvenient. Also the wifi is non existent. How is it possible that in 2019 a hotel can't have quality internet? We own a business so it is very important to have reliable internet while traveling. If they could make these couple of changes I would rate this a 5 star hotel.","29478":"The rooms are very clean. The hotel\u2019s location is perfect-close to everything there is to do. The lobby is tastefully decorated and the breakfast that is included is adequate with lots of variety for even the miost discriminating guests. Great stay!","29479":"The hotel is very spacious and the room was very spacious. The hotel was very clean and tidy. The front desk was very helpful in finding restaurants that were good around town. Room 503 had a coffee maker\/ hot pot. The roof terrace was nice after walking around Palermo all day. The location of the hotel was relatively close to everything you can walk to and if you need to take a bus it was two blocks away. Breakfast was just fine it was enough to easily get us to lunch. The air-conditioners worked very well in the room we are staying In. We had a beautiful view of the horses on top of the Poleteama Garibaldi. Depending on the room you get when you check-in some of the rooms have different amenities that others friends of ours had a hot pot and pants press in their room. Also they had a jacuzzi tub and we had only a shower. Their room was on the fifth floor and ours was on the 4th. We didn\u2019t get the turn down service 2?of the days and our friends did with cookies left on their beds. We really enjoyed this hotel and the staff was top notch!","29480":"Well we had four nights five nights and a lovely hotel to stay in. I have stayed in quite a few hotels and this is in the top of my list. It is quiet, well furnished,large bed,wardrobe quite large room, excellent toilet facilities, and clean. There is only 1 drawback, our room had 1 electrical socket, and no USB ports, but never mind, we got bye.Not long enough stay really, but enjoyed it. This hotel has excellent views on the roof terrace.","29481":"The hotel is in a great location and within walking distance to Old Town and shopping. The staff were friendly and efficient and rooms were clean and well serviced. Shame you have to pay for parking when your doing a drive\/stay holiday","29483":"My husband and I had a nice couple of days in Palermo before taking off to drive around Sicily. This hotel was recommended by a travel agent we know, and it was in a great spot. Staff members were friendly (the breakfast crew in particular were wonderful and helpful) and our room was a little run down but clean and cozy. With some TLC on the room furniture and bathroom fixtures, this place would be even higher on the list, but I'm still very comfortable recommending it for your next trip to Palermo.","29484":"We stayed at Plaza Opera four nights in June 19, this is our firth stay at this very nice Hotel, the staff are great, always willing to help if needed, the hotel is always very clean with a good breakfast, the hotel is great for sight seeing, easy to visit the port and local town with same great restaurants nearby.\nWe were lucky during our stay to listen to a wonderful open concert held at the square outside the Opera house.\nWe always choose this hotel for our stay in Palermo.\n\nAudrey Edgar","29485":"My husband and I stayed two nights in this hotel. The staff were very helpful, arranging for a private car to take us to the airport. Our room was well appointed with comfortable beds. The breakfast room is a little small but the food was good. I particularly liked the fresh pineapple. The location allowed us to explore the old city on foot.","29487":"Beautiful and elegant hotel. Great location - close to very nice restaurants and high end stores. Good staff who provided good service. Will definitely consider staying here onnour next trip to Palermo.","29488":"Nice small property with great staff that really made an effort to make you feel comfortable. Breakfast pastries or very good and staff in the morning was exceptional. Highly recommend this property for stay in Palermo","29492":"The front desk team here really made our stay. Super helpful and accommodating with our needs. Above and beyond really.\n\nOr three rooms were modern, comfortable and super clean. Hotel is is a very good location.\n\nOnly slight niggle was the rather basic breakfast and bland coffee. But, this is very minor and certainly a subjective opinion.\n\nWe'd stay here again for certain next time in Palermo!","29498":"Beautiful, fresh hotel and very clean. Our room was comfortable. We found it easy to walk to restaurants and shops during our 3 night stay. Staff at the front desk were great and helped us with suggestions and taxis. There is a very convenient parking garage across the street from the hotel.","29503":"This hotel is outside the old town area where all of the things you want to see in Palermo are located. It wasn't too far of a walk but I would have preferred to stay in that area rather than have to walk in and out all of the time. The hotel room was small, though clean and well kept. The front desk staff was generally friendly with the exception of the woman who checked us in who seemed to have a bit of an attitude.","29504":"This was a conveniently located hotel near the historic centre. Rooms were well appointed and bathroom\/shower fine. Probably a little on the small size but city centre it\u2019s what you expect. Bearing in mind Italian hotels are pretty poor on breakfast this was average; plenty of cake\/bread etc bits of cheese and ham. The fruit was very ordinary. The dining area was quite crowded particularly near the buffet. as there was a small tour party staying. The staff were helpful and friendly. But it is a good location with a couple of excellent bars nearby for nightcaps. Also very good for airport shuttle bus drop off\/pick up. So I would happily stay there again if in Palermo!","29508":"As part of a several day land tour of Sicily and Italy this was one of the hotels that we stayed at. The room and the hotel was very nice, I don't speak Italian but the front desk did understand my english and I had no problems with the basics, I needed change for small purchases, Directions, etc. In every case the hotel did help me get to know this area.","29510":"Excellent location. Extremely nice and helpful people everyone! Room not very large but very bright and comfortable and excellent bathroom. Typical breakfast. A very positive experience. Our first room wasn\u2019t as bright. Immediately they helped us to smother room. A very nice room","29511":"The three of us were in a rather small room with a queen bed and a twin. The room was quiet and had a refrigerator and hot water pot which we appreciated. We had asked for recommendations for a traditional Sicilian restaurant but discovered Antica Birreria Moretti which was fairly close on our own.\nThe bathroom had a very deep tub which may not work for some people.\nBreakfast was included.\nTransportation to the airport via taxi was a standard 38 euros.\nWe would recommend.","29515":"Excellent service. Very friendly staff. Room was small but very clean and modern. Very good value for hotel in Palermo. Easy to walk to shops and dinning. Car service was exceptional. Breakfast room is very nice.","29517":"We found the bedroom not to the standard we were expecting. The bed was very hard and the shower was over a high bath so potentially dangerous.\nThe breakfast was simple and fresh. The cakes looked delicious.\nThe suggestion for a dinner location proved very good.","29518":"We stayed 10 nights at this hotel and thoroughly enjoyed every moment of it.\nThe room was clean and a good size with a nice bathroom and plenty of storage space. The air conditioning, a necessity in Palermo, was efficient and easy to control.\nBoth the location and the rooms are very quiet. We did not hear any noise the whole time we were there and enjoyed undisturbed nights.\nBreakfast was good with a wide range of food and excellent service for coffee and eggs from the manager. This provided a very good start to the day.\nThe reception area is pleasant to sit in and the staff were always attentive and helpful.\nThis hotel is within comfortable walking distance of many restaurants and bars and a lot of the main sites in Palermo.\nFinding the right hotel in a big city is not always easy but I would recommend this to anyone looking for a nice place to stay at a very reasonable price.","29519":"We have been travelling for a few weeks now and really noticed our helpful the staff were and it made our experience at this hotel so more enjoyable.They looked up places to visit for us to see if they were open and advised how to get around.\nBreakfast was very basic with no hot food but this is not uncommon in this price range.","29520":"This Hotel was a pleasant surprise as we were not sure what to expect prior to arrival. Hotel is well situated being close to good restaurants and Palermo attractions all within comfortable walking distance. Staff are all pleasant and ready to help with all requests, rooms are clean, spacious well appointed with a very good air conditioning system. A quality breakfast is provided with assistance provided by the excellent Antonio.\nHotel can organize pick up and drop off from airport by luxury vehicle ( approx 80 euro).\nYou cannot go wrong by staying here","29524":"Pros: The gentleman who checked us in was extremely friendly and helpful. The lobby was attractive and the breakfast and breakfast room were nice. Hotel wa a short walk from nearly everything - very convenient.\n\nCons: Several websites we consulted advertised that this hotel had 24 hr. room service. But the man who checked us in said there was no room service. We checked out early because room service is something important to my wife, who is disabled. The man who checked us out got angry with us and argued that they can bring coffee or even breakfast up to our room if we had asked, and that qualified as room service. He threatened to bill our credit card since we elected not to pay for our second night. It was kind of a downer. The room had no coffee maker or water heater and was otherwise fairly bare-bones. We also mentioned that there was quite a bit of noise in our room and the guy got angry and said no one had every complained about noise there.","29527":"Large clean room ,uneven staff help, great breakfast, very noisy neighborhood. Do not get a room on the front side of the hotel.Night clerk was very helpful with getting a printed airplane ticket to fly from Palermo to Rome.","29528":"Very central position.... and that\u2019s about it really. It\u2019s clean and tidy but basic accommodation compared to other similar rated hotels we stayed in. Breakfast average and unchanging. Staff slightly surly at times. Meh!","29529":"The only positive I can come up with Hotel Posta is its location which was great for the airport bus and within reasonable walking distance of all the main sites.\n\nUnfortunately, that's where the praise stops. The staff were polite enough and, located in a side street, noise wasn't an issue. But the room was functional rather than comfortable, there was no fridge and the hanging space was of the small and open variety, ie no cupboard. The bathroom was cramped and in dire need of an overhaul. There were multiple clusters of mould in the shower and the electrics looked like they hadn't been updated for 30 years and was starting to look dangerous. The shower was just hot enough and just powerful enough.\n\nThe breakfast buffet selection was uninteresting and unvarying, comprising cheap, commodity products and missing the thoughtful extras that would earn another TA blob.The wifi was serviceable tho frequently dropped out and there were inadequate power sockets for modern needs.\n\nOverally, Posta Hotel looked much better online than it did in person and is really somewhere you would want stay no longer than 2 days max.","29531":"The road to get to this hotel is a bit stressful (if you\u2019re not used to driving in Palermo). It\u2019s in a zone limited traffic area and the hotel has to organise with authorities so you don\u2019t get a fine.\nThe parking wasn\u2019t easy to find. Had to ask someone at the hotel who told us to park on the side and they parked the car somewhere for 15 Euro a night. Staff are really nice and friendly. Room is spacious but no fridge. Air conditioner worked well and wasn\u2019t noisy. Can\u2019t hear noise outside with the doors to the balcony closed.\nOnly let down was the bathroom.\nShower had mould and the water pressure is terrible. The inside of the rim of the toilet was also dirty. Bring your own shower cap. Shampoo and cake of soap provided. Hair dryer available. Great location and only a few minutes walk to some nice sights. Breakfast has a good variety and staff make you coffee upon request. City tax was 12 euro for 2 people for 4 nights. Was a nice stay!","29534":"Hotel posta is a charming small Hotel located right in the center of palermo Sicily staff is friendly and caring rooms are spacious bathrooms a bit small but good for 4 days it also offers a complimentary breakfast I will certainly stay there again","29539":"Good location just off Via Roma, walking distance to many local places to see and visit. This hotel is good value for money, this isn\u2019t a five star hotel and we didn\u2019t expect it to be.\n\nRooms were clean and presented no issues of complaint.\n\nContinental breakfast was fine. Staff were polite and helpful. Picture is from the roof terrace of hotel.","29540":"The hotel I have just stayed in bore no resemblance to the one on the website. If it has recently been refurbished, I dread to think what it was like before. When my friend and I (two ladies of a certain age) arrived, the receptionist watched as we struggled to get our suitcases up the steps. We then discovered that the double room with balcony we had booked was a dark, poky double with no balcony. The receptionist offered us a tiny room with a balcony for the night saying we could change for a better one the next day. When we saw it, we had a Basil Fawlty-type argument, with him insisting that the small window was a balcony. Eventually he found us a better room, after telling us off for trying to separate the double bed into two, to enable them to change it. When we asked how to operate the air conditioning, he told us to press the light switch three times - without pointing out the remote control. Fortunately it did work eventually, otherwise we would have left. I was told off again in no uncertain terms for reaching behind the receptionist, who was busy with another guest, to retrieve my key, which has to be handed in when you go out. In the early evening, several people were waiting in reception as there was no-one there. I let in several guests who could not get in as the receptionist had gone out and locked the front door!\n\nThe room was shabby and extremely cheaply furnished: there were two hangers each and the drawers either did not open at all or were very stiff and difficult to open and close. No luxuries such as safe or fridge - or the cups featured on the website. The base of the shower was covered in nasty black mould. There was a large boiler in the bathroom which didn't seem to help the efficiency of the shower. A sticker had been placed on the bathroom door, clearly covering a hole. The balcony, overlooking the rubbish-strewn street was unkempt, with weeds growing on it and a dead plant on the railing. The shuttered door had clearly not been painted for some time and was a challenge to close. Similarly, the roof terrace, which could be a delightful space for a drink, was shabby,dirty, unswept and generally unkempt. Breakfast was dismal.\n\nYes, all of the sights are within walking distance and Dario, one the receptionists and the waitress were helpful and friendly.","29541":"In Palermo, we did all of our tours on foot. The hotel is perfectly located to provide pedestrian access to major points of interest and restaurants. The staff is friendly and helpful, offering recommendations for food and even lending a pair of scissors and a transformer when needed. There is a nice bar open at all hours and a nice breakfast provided. The room we had was comfortable and perfectly adequate to our needs.","29542":"Great location just off Via Roma with a large neon light on the main road pointing at the side alley. You get off the airport bus at Vucciria 350 yards down the road from said alley on the opposite side. The return bus stop is even closer, half the distance. Teatro Massimo is 300 yards away down the back alleys that lead to Via Maqueda. ALL the back alleys off Maqueda seem to offer up cafes\/Bars\/restaurants. Staff were very friendly. We arrived a couple of hours before checkin but after a 5 minute wait we got the key. We also left our cases for a few hours after checkout to pick up later. Room was comfortable, breakfast was good, WiFi was fine. Highly recommended. The only drawback I can think of is the shower is the smallest I\u2019ve ever seen, or struggled to get in. Surprisingly the bathroom is a good size. Possibly because the shower didn\u2019t take up much room.","29543":"Hidden away by the Vie Roma the place was ideal for a first time visitor. Despite the off-road location (and because of it) there was little noise to disturb a good night's sleep. Staff were excellent with top-rate linguistic skills, very informative about the best places to visit (and avoid) and very pleased to ensure our stay was the best it could be. The rooms were clean and very comfortable with ample space to stretch out. The bathroom was better than mere functional. Breakfast catered for all tastes and diets and was delightful. Location was brilliant for days out in the city without the need for transport.","29544":"We stayed at the Hotel Posta on 27th to 30th April 2019. As a group of friends we booked 3 x doubles configured as twin rooms and 2 x twin rooms for single occupancy. I stayed in one of the latter, room 201. The whole group found their rooms to be comfortable and well equipped. It was felt that some of the rooms could have pinched a few more square feet from the \u2018dining room\u2019 area within their rooms and used it to make the bathroom\/shower bigger. However, we were in the hotel for approximately 9 hours per day. 7 hours sleeping, 1 hour resting\/getting ready! 1 hour eating (a leisurely and filling breakfast). All of our group slept well. All of the staff, no matter what their role was within the hotel, were brilliant. Welcoming, friendly, helpful, patient and good humoured throughout our stay. Breakfast was open from 7a.m. to 11 a.m. so we didn\u2019t feel rushed or miss out on a \u2018lie in\u2019 and some of our party made use of the guests bar for a nightcap before retiring each night. The Hotel Posta is a lovely hotel, with lovely staff, in a great location representing great value for money. Within easy walking distance of all the main attractions. And there are many in Palermo, a culturally and historically fascinating city. Top tip; Don\u2019t just step out of the main door. There isn\u2019t a pavement and the road, believe it or not, is open to traffic - cars, scooters cyclists. They tend to come from your right, but not always. In the \u2018right of way\u2019 pecking order in Palermo, pedestrians are at the bottom!!!","29546":"Stayed here for two nights at the beginning of a small group tour of Sicily. The staff were friendly and the public areas were clean and well-maintained, but the rooms were very variable in size and quality. Some of the others in the group had lovely rooms, but mine was a very small twin with visually unpleasant black and white zigzag wallpaper? paint? covering two of the walls. The bathroom was small but perfectly usable, although the shower pressure wasn't good; there was also quite a lot of street noise as well as odd noises from inside the hotel (what sounded like snoring, whenever I was in the room, whether morning afternoon or evening - and I wasn't the only one who heard it).\n\nBreakfast was ok but the choice was minimal - it was the worst selection of the six hotels we stayed in in Sicily.\n\nThe location is very good, in the historic part of Palermo and very close to many of the major sights.","29550":"We had a beautiful room, there were 3 rooms off a seating\/dining area, music was played throughout the day, it was so nice. Aside from the shower there was also a bath in our room, I absolutely loved that, the furniture was really nice and in keeping, in fact when I sent photo's home and have shown them to people they are amazed at how beautiful the room is. There are plenty of biscuits and you can help yourself to tea and coffee in the communal area, if you are staying in one of the delux rooms, aside from the complimentary biscuits and tea and coffee making facilities in your room.\nLike a fellow reviewer, we speak no Italian (aside from the basic few words) but there were no issues for us either. They will look after your luggage if the room isn't ready, or you have some time to kill before leaving for the airport.\nNice breakfast , and lounge\/bar area, staff were really nice and friendly.\nThe location is perfect you, can get more or less anywhere without the use of transport, other than your feet! Palermo is really beautiful, we are so glad we went, and so glad that Suzanne from Sicilian Experience recommended this hotel. We would certainly return, if we were to visit Palermo again.","29552":"We had a room on the first floor with a small balcony. It had all you needed with 2 chairs, enough wardrobe space and a very comfortable bed. The bathroom was kept clean and everything worked but as others have noted may be due for some upgrading. Staff were excellent particularly Chiara on reception. Contrary to other reviews we had no problem with the language even though we speak no Italian. We were given several good recommendations for restaurants. Breakfasts were good with all the usual meats, cheeses, cereals, fruit, yoghurt etc. The location is excellent - none of the main sites and train station are more than 15 mins away. There is also a very nice roof terrace to relax with a drink. We would stay there again if we return to Palermo.","29553":"Good location, within walking distance of historic centre but the room was very basic and in need of an upgrade. There was a hole in the door which we had to plug with toilet tissue as otherwise you could see straight into the room. The photos on the hotel website make the rooms look much better than they actually are. The walls and doors are paper thin so take earplugs. The noise of other guests using the bathroom or moving about in corridors was very loud and quite disruptive.\n\nReception staff were helpful but their grasp of English was variable. Some very good, others clearly only knew stock phrases and couldn\u2019t answer more detailed or unusual questions.\n\nThe roof terrace was a lovely place to sit and relax though.\n\nThis was the most expensive place we stayed in Sicily but was actually the worst in terms of comfort and facilities.","29555":"I loved the location, convenient to Teatro Massimo and all major sights. I walked everywhere. A 3 star hotel, very reasonably priced, excellent staff, room was fine. For some reason not so much on American radar - most guests during my stay were European. Perhaps American tourists are more likely to choose 4 star hotels? Many Americans seem to spend very little time in Palermo. Big mistake - it is a great city!","29564":"Very good location, friendly staff, basic room and comfy bed. Hairdryer did not work. There is no free shuttle bus to Mondello. Be aware you pay the hotel tax on check out. I am use to paying it when I check in to hotels.","29569":"Hotel in heart of city, within easy walking distance of most major sights; friendly and helpful staff; good breakfast, comfortable rooms; parking on site. Would happily stay here again - Palermo rocks!","29570":"A typical three star hotel. Nice room, nice bathroom, good breakfast and very good service. We arrived very late ( 11 p.m. ) and had no problems with the check in or with the parking\nThe main advantage of the hotel is its location and the in site parking . Perfect for touring Palermo's old city with no worries for the parking","29572":"Unfortunately, my review is not so generous. Hotel did not timely honor our request for changing our reservation resulting in us paying for two nights we did not use. It was classic he said she said with booking.com. What is worse is that today the rate is $100 a night less than what we paid.\n\nShould have let the homeless man around the corner stay in the room...at least somebody would have gotten the benefit.","29586":"From a very friendly welcome, to an efficient departure, this place could not be faulted.\nThey helpfully arranged a taxi pick-up from the airport, and warmly greeted us at reception of arrival. Friendly concierge looked after all the bags. Room was minimalist in design but quite comfortable; extra large bed - good. All bathroom facilities worked well.\nBreakfast was comprehensive. Coffee good. The hotel is very conveniently placed if you like walking to your tourist destinations - as we do.","29587":"We enjoyed our stay here, we had a balcony with a view onto the street which was very atmospheric. An aperatif on the roof terrace is a must especially at night. Our room was quite small but nicely decorated. The staff were friendly.","29597":"Location is very nice and most attractions are located within a walking distance. Staff is helpful, welcoming and very nice. They speak at least italian, french and english! Breakfast is correct but is the same everyday (even though the croissant are very good). I recommend the hotel without any hesitation!","29602":"It is a bit of walk into the center of town, but we thoroughly enjoyed this property. Parking was very secure on site. Several excellent restaurants within a couple of minutes walk. Staff outstanding - Ben, Pia and Nicola could not have been more helpful.","29613":"This 4 star hotel mystifies me. The staff is warm and friendly. The breakfast is decent. The linens are excellent, The little touches such sewing kit, Q tips, shampoo and soap are all indeed 4 star quality. Yet the hotel seems to lack any maintenance personnel and it shows -- badly. It seems this hotel is about 15 years old and It was done right - large rooms, quality mattresses etc. But things got worn out and break down over the years, yet none of this is attended to. For example the faucets are loose, the toilet seats are too small for the fixture (use your imagination) the railings for handicapped in the lobby are falling out of the walls, the plexiglass luggage backsplash in our room was cracked and broken and so unsightly we had to cover it it up. the chair looked as if it had been chewed by a dog. the colorful Welcome to Palermo book was more dog eared and flea bitten than an old monk's Bible. The tragedy in all this is that most of the disrepair is cosmetic and\/or could easily be fixed if anyone would bother to walk through the rooms and take note.","29615":"We arrived on morning ferry from Naples at 7:30am and staff wee super friendly and helpful, letting us park our car in the secure car park before we checked in at 1pm. Room was huge, comfy bed and good shower (if a little leaky!).\n\n15 min walk to tourist centre along pretty streets with lots of genuine restaurants and shops away from the cruise crowds and tourist tat.\n\nBreakfast was usual fare and overall a good price for a decent comfy room and super lovely staff. Would stay again.","29618":"Not a 4 star hotel more like 2 star. The room is not soundproof there was crashing and banging and slamming of doors until well after midnight The facilities are very poor. We\nAre in a very expensive sujte. We wanted 2 tvs, only 1 of them works. There is no chance of anything i n English not even BBC world. The wiring is poor, to switch the air con off you have to do it at the fuse box. There is no pay TV. The so!arium is a tiny terrace with no facilities which you get to via a messy conference room. The window is dirty. No chairs on the balcony. One air con unit very dirty\n\nIn conclusion very very poor value for money.","29625":"We had a joyful stay on summer holiday at Parlermo, we arrived earlier by 12ish & they immediate allowed us check-in, staff are caring, efficient & always smile, FLUENT English, Hotel Manager super helpful & nice he guided us the bus station.\n\nThe hotel keep in well condition, rooms is very clean, air-condition is cold enough, beding towel gels are renew daily, car park included, pet allow & super caring, more verity on breakfast not only Italian bread also have black coffee, fast internet.\n\nLocation is quite close to center, 10mins walk to bus station for tourist stuff the duration about 15-30mins depend where to visit (bus every 20mins), close everywhere on big\/small restaurants by walking distance within 30mins though those streets, drove to Mondello beach around 30mins on normal traffic (traffic on summer time).\n\nWe really satisfied on this hotel, comfortable & calm place, we highly recommended.","29632":"Pros:\n- Location: (Walking) Ignazio Mormino Museum of Art and Archaeology (14mins), Arsenale di Palermo (15mins), Palazzo De Gregorio (15mins).\n- Bathroom amenities: Liquid hand soap, body wash, shower gel, shower cap, vanity kit, shoe sponge, sewing kit, tissues, average quality hairdryer.\n- As many have previously mentioned, the highlight of this hotel is the incredible staff! Service at its best! The staff here is better than most 5 star hotels.\n- Free in-room WiFi (but see \u2018Cons\u2019).\n- Large, spacious room.\n\nCons:\n- WiFi speed is incredibly slow (and most of the time, it didn\u2019t work at all). Average in-room speed of only 0.4Mbps and parts of the room with zero coverage.\n- A deeper cleanliness could be better. The telephone and the toilet button actually looked dirty when you pushed it in.\n- Limited storage space. While the room was large, there was almost no space for storage.\n- Air conditioner did not function, thus the room was incredibly hot during the night and opening the window let in too much noise, making sleep difficult.\n- The room was more 3 stars than 4 stars. TV extremely small, very hard mattress, limited breakfast (no fresh milk), room needs major maintenance.","29634":"This is a lovely hotel in the poshest area of the town.\nRooms are modern and very comfortable, breakfast offers a lovely range of specialties from Palermo.\nStaff couldn't be more welcoming and helpful. Lovely.","29647":"This hotel was a great find and we really enjoyed our stay. From the moment we arrived until we left the staff were warm, friendly and helpful. The hotel is situated in a quiet area about a 15 minute walk from the old town with secure parking at the rear. This is a big bonus as Palermo is very busy and parking not easy to find. Our very quiet room at the back of the hotel overlooking the outdoor breakfast area was large, comfortable and clean. Breakfast was very good offering Sicilian favourites and excellent coffee. Palermo is fascinating - take a Hop On, Hop Off bus tour of the city and also their bus to Monreale is a must for the magnificent mosaics in the cathedral.","29652":"This hotel is in a great spot. Walking distance to all of the sights but in a nice local area. Fab secure parking and easy to get too. Breakfast was lovely. We stayed for three nights at the beginning of our trip to Sicily and would have gone back at the end of the trip if wasn't fully booked. Rooms could be a little more up together for a four star but clean, safe and lovely and helpful staff. Recommended.","29653":"Staff is very helpful and friendly, even breakfast earlier than officially published times was possible. Good hints for excellent restaurants were obtained and reservations made by the staff. Everything well taken care of.","29683":"We had a pleasant stay in hotel. Breakfest was always full and many choices. View from the room was awesome, view to seaside. Room was clean and had always clean towels.\nStaff of the hotel is very nice!\nWe recommend this hotel!","29691":"The hotel is lovely, we spent 14 nights at the hotel and can honestly say all the staff are kind friendly and most helpful, all talked our language as well as a variety of others. They were just kind polite and most of all welcoming. The hotel was okay with the only massive downside was the main road but wouldn\u2019t be an issue with a sea view, but nether the less the people here make up for that. Would recommend for most people. 10\/10 on friendliness 10\/10 cleanliness.","29702":"I booked this hotel because of the parking and it\u2019s not too far to walk into town (about 50 minutes) although it\u2019s not a particularly nice walk. The hotel itself was ok. The room was good sized and clean but on the front of the property and it was a bit noisy especially in the morning rush hour. Breakfast was ok typical hotel buffet style.","29713":"We stayed only for a night coming from a tour to Sicily and We chose it because of the free parking.early in the morning we had to go to the airport.chrck in was easy and the reception staff was good.they have a big space behind the entrance to park your car.its easy to find it as it is in a central avenue. The room was very old a bit depressing I would say but it was ok for a sleep.","29721":"We stayed here for 3 nights for the wedding of my friend and I really enjoyed my stay in this hotel with the kind, hospitable and courteous staff who were always available for any request or favor I asked them. Not to forget that some are generous enough to offer me coffee even though the bar was not open yet. Food is very good from breakfast to dinner. We were a group of 15 friends and so the hotel became like a family house for us.","29723":"This hotel is on the outskirts of Palermo, by the sea and several cafes and restuarants\nwithin walking distance.\nThe room was a good size, clean and comfortable.\nWe were travelling to Calabria having been on the ferry from Genova.\nThe parking was safe, behind the hotel.\nStaff were pleasant and helpful.\nWould return.","29725":"The hotel is on outskirts of Palermo. We went in September 2018. Shocking to see so much litter piled up along the pavements & roads. Bins overflowing. Walked to a seafront & could no believe the amount of plastic & what looked like building rubble strewn along the seafront. It was very smelly. The hotel is basic but clean. Even in the new part of the hotel there is no guarantee of hot water for showers. Although the hotel has been extended it seems the hot water supply cannot cope. Beware when taking a shower as it can suddenly turn cold. There is no information in the rooms or hotel telling the easiest way to travel into Palermo city centre (well worth it when you do). The receptionist will give out information if you ask. There is also a curtesy vehicle that can take you. The trams are near & easy to use. Buy tickets in a paper\/tobacconist. Breakfast is cold buffet type but was not always replenished. Tea bags often ran out. No tea or coffee in rooms. You can buy this in the restaurant but it seems to be a bit of a chore. Palermo is a lovely city the Hotel is basic good but the area is very dirty.","29820":"This B&B is superb! Amazing breakfast, fresh homemade cakes, coffee and many other sweets. The room is spacious and spotless clean. It\u2019s an amazing value for money. They are all so friendly. We feel like at home. It\u2019s very comfortable. It is situated in a quiet neighborhood a bit far to the center for our liking (maybe 25 mins walking distance but note my mother is a middle age woman in her 60s) so it wouldn\u2019t be a problem for young people. Highly recommend!","29885":"I had a two night stay here. The room was clean and new and the location was excellent.\nMariarita was very pleasant and helpful.\n\nOn the down side, the property is entered remotely, so arriving in a totally unfamiliar city there is no one to suggest where to eat, or give any other information.\nA folder in the room with suggestions would have been helpful.\n\nMy Booking confirmation clearly stated a double room with balcony.\nThe balcony was a big disappointment. It overlooked a narrow dark lane full of air conditioning units and ducting. I don't think the balcony should be advertised for this room as it certainly wasn't a pleasant feature of my stay.","29948":"Good comfortable room. Clean well decorated and furnished. Owner is very friendly, I felt like he was my best friend before, he contacted me, sent directions advice, told us where to go to eat and what to see. It is central and Palermo is noisy, but has good double glazing and air con.","29950":"Cupole Deco is lovely B & B in the historical center of Palermo. Marcello is the friendly owner who loves to travel himself, so he knows how to make you comfortable and easy. When you come by car, he can offer you a paid parking place one street behind the B & B. He loves to give you all the info you need about Palermo. Breakfast is served two blocks away on Piazza Domenico at Lucchese. The rooms are clean and new and ours looked out over Palermo.\nThe B & B is on the fifth floor at Via Napoli, there is an elevator!","29968":"Good value for money, great location for our short stay! Clean, modern and well managed! This is a B&B but works perfectly well as a concept and much better value than the main hotels at this standard! Key areas of Palermo in walking distance , so perfect for short stay if you just want to explore the city centre! Vucceria is a short 10 minutes walk away!","29987":"We spent a week at Villa Di Nera in June and would highly recommend it! We had a large suite, which was very tastefully decorated and very clean.\nThe owner Riccardo is friendly, welcoming and accommodating, and there is a nice, quiet atmosphere.\nThe bus stops to the city centre and Mondello are right outside the hotel, and being in the middle of both worked well for us, as we visited Mondello several times. There is also a beach just 5 minutes walk away.\nGreat value for money!","30085":"We stayed here for one night after having been to Trapani a few times before, we were getting into the Aliscafo to Favignana the next day.\nThis was an amazing experience mainly due to meeting Agostino and obviously reading the other reviews we are not the only ones who feel like this!\nFirstly the accommodation is immaculate and of a very very high standard close to everything and has easy access to all tourist attractions and port etc.\nAgostino when he realised we had not reserved tickets for the ferry took the lead and rang up direct to book....outstanding! But there's more after we had been in Favignana for nearly a week I asked if he knew of a reputable taxi for our transfer to Palermo....obviously outside of his remit but I knew he would help as much as he could. Result cheap taxi share and lovely transfer :grimacing:\nDo not take my word for it just stay there when you go to Trapani. You will not find any better....Salut mi amico!!!\nIan x","30089":"We are 2 adults and 2 teenagers who stayed in this B&B in June. First of all, I need to say that of the 10 hotels we stayed in during our 2.5-week-trip to Sicily, Agostino, the owner of this B&B, was the nicest, friendliest, and most caring person to us. Beyond being the best host we could ask for, Agostino welcomed us straight away as if we were his relatives or long-time friends, making us feel \u201cat home\u201d immediately. He had a high standard to beat, as all the people we met in Sicily were extraordinarily kind, but Agostino surpassed all expectations. Throughout your stay, he meets you and helps you bring your luggage up and down the stairs, recommends good restaurants, and can make a reservation for you on a boat tour (if you wish to visit the Egadi Islands, they can even give you a small discount when he makes the reservation). The breakfast was wonderful, and Agostino makes the best cappuccino in Sicily! We had great conversations with Agostino and became friends with him very quickly; we hope he will come and visit us sometime! Overall, the B&B is conveniently located by the restaurants and Trapani port, nicely decorated, and clean. We highly recommend a stay here!","30161":"We stayed in trapani to be our base for the egadi islands, erice, segesta and San Vito. Our accommodation was in such an excellent location also across from the apartments is an excellent bakery the chocolate croissants!! I'll never get anything like that in Ireland so if staying do pop in and they sell tasty lunch too! The apartments are great we were looked after really well and they are so helpful. Thank you","30266":"In the middle of Trapani, we at last found our \"hotel\". It has no reception, but I called Antonella, like booking.com had told me to. She was there when we arrived and helped us in, and to our apartment. Nice apartments with sea view. Clean and tidy. Nearby are many shops, restaurants, parking lot, ++. Easy to have rental car and park nearby. Close distance to Erice.\nthe bed was ok, but the sofa-bed was not a comfortable bed.\n\nNo activites for kids.","30268":"Here you get a great location right in the middle of it. Via garibalidi is the passegiata in Trapani. Loads of good restaurants and bars and ofcourse people just walking by. 10 minuties from the nice city beach. The rooms are big and very moderna. But as always the utilities are in very poor condition. Not enough spoons och forks and no knife to cut bread. As an example.\nYou can get rooms with a nice sea view. If you get a room towards the Via garibaldi be prepared for loud noice. Just by the entrance ther is a bar that plays VERY LOUD music until 3 o clock in the morning och weekends. Bring earplugs or join the fun.\nThe receptionist can arrange transport from the airport for 30 E one way for four persons. Good if you arrive late. They clame to have free Wi Fi int the room but that did not work.","30269":"This is a great, clean and centrally located place to stay in Trapani.\nThe place is located on one of the main thoroughfares of the historic center of Trapani, close to restaurants and bars and wonderfully placed for exploring Trapani and neighoring locations and especially for the evening passegiata. The port and ferries are bout a 10-15 min walk away.\nThe staff were helpful and efficient throughout and were always on hand.\nThe room itself is actually a small apartment - complete with a small kitchen so perfect for couples or individuals who would like to make their own food. There is a TV, air con. and the furnishings are modern and tasteful. The bed is comfortable and everything is spotlessly clean. We stayed in the room on the ground floor with its own courtyard, complete with tables and chairs, which was lovely, tranquil and very quiet.\nBreakfast is served on a terrace overlooking the via garibaldi and while not extensive is absolutely fine.\nWe were very impressed with the accommodation and would recommend this. Excellent value for money.","30271":"The apartment was clean and it was equal as shown on the Internet. No bad surprise then. The location is perfect and nearby there's a bunch of bars and restaurant. Also there's a nice private beach nearby called Lido Paradiso.\n\nI can mention only 2 defects:\n\n1- if you get the apt on Garibaldi street, be prepared to hear a lot of noise till 2am due to the bars.\n2- in the morning you can smell the sewer and that is not a pleasure.","30272":"I came back from Trapani yesterday and all I can say about the Garibaldi Guesthouse is that I will most definitly go back. I had the room with the garden outside and it was charming and relaxing atmosphere with something like a palmtree in the middle. The room with a kitchen and toilett w. shower is great. The furniture is new and you have a flatscreen TV at the room. The room has AC and WiFi. The staff is great, really. They really made my stay there easy.\n\nThe beach is 2 min. from Garibaldi and you live in the city center, historical area at the same time.\n\nI should mantion that I came to GARIBALDI from the other B&B I actually booked (Casa Malvarosa) and it was the horror movie. The lady there wasn\u00b4t helpful at all when I wanted to talk to her about the problems I had staying there (I have astma and at Malvarosa they have cat and the dog and the place smells urin, the air in the house is so \"damp\" and it feels like it has never been opend a windo in that house.)\n\nSo to come to Garibaldi and meet these great people was a relife. I will go back again.","30273":"We stayed in Garibaldi 31 for 7 nights in peak season august. We booked the more expensive sea facing apartment which was worth the extra for the beautiful sea view and the calming noise of waves at night. The apartment itself was not too large-more like a hotel room with a kitchen. The furnishings were very modern and the bed extremely comfortable. Service and communication with the rep. were very good.\nVia Garibaldi is a perfect base for a stay in Trapani. The street is car free and situated in the heart of the historical area of the town.Trapani was a pleasant surprise with good cafes,restaurants and shops all within wallking distance . The port for ferries etc. is a10 minute walk and the local beach[not great sand but good for swimming] only 5.\nIt was peak season and the streets were really busy with locals and tourists walking [and eating ice-cream] well into the night and while it was very peaceful,the front apartments overlooking Via Garibaldi were probably not as quiet as the sea facing ones.\nOverall, We were impressed by these apartments and would recommend it as base for visiting Trapani.","30274":"Garibaldi 31 B&B is comfortable, spacious, nicely situated in the historical center of Trapani, and very reasonably priced. Antonella, the manager, was very helpful and very friendly, even though our flight was delayed several hours and we arrived around midnight. We found a parking place relatively close with no trouble, but you do have to take the statement \u201cfree parking in the neighborhood\u201d with some caution. If you email Antonella in advance, she will tell you the best places to look. Breakfast was inexpensive at a bar about 50 meters from the B&B. Even 4 and 5 star hotels don\u2019t always have a couch to read or watch TV, but we a nice, comfortable couch plus a kitchen and an interestingly modern decor. If you\u2019re mainly looking for an overnight near the airport, this probably isn\u2019t the best place, but Trapani is worth exploring, and if you want to see Trapani, Garibaldi 31 is great. If we return to Trapani, we will certainly stay there again.\nIf you do visit Trapani, a really good (and reasonably priced) restaurant is the Trattoria da Salvatore on Via Nunzio Nasi. I don\u2019t think Salvatore is into the information age (and the restaurant isn\u2019t in Trip Advisor), but the food was fantastic, and the busiate alla trapanese shouldn\u2019t be missed.","30275":"I arranged to rent this apt in part because it claimed at the Google info page and at Booking.com that free parking was available nearby. I had thought it must be on the edge of the Trapani pedestrian mall in Centro storico. \u201cFree parking\u201d for this location is kind of like saying that there is free parking available in Manhattan, if you can actually find a spot. I should have been alerted when the directions came by email and it included \u201cpark in the neighborhood\u201d without any further directions on where this free parking was that was supposedly nearby. The street in front of this apt is part of the pedestrian mall in the historical district of Trapani and you cannot even drive your car up to the apt to unload your luggage. I could have rented a place like Ai Lumi further inside the historical district that was more charming but was upfront about no parking was available, if I had had wanted to rent a place where parking was a problem. I did not want to take a chance on having my rental car vandalized parked far away from my lodging with no one to keep an eye on it.\n\nWe called Antonella the welcome manager on our cell when we left Castellammare del Golfo and left a message on voice mail that we were coming (no one answered) using the number that came in our confirmation email. We get to Trapani, my daughter parks next to the sea (illegally it turns out) and I walk up to the building on foot and call again (door is locked). I get some guy who tells me to call the main office. I call them and they claim that they have no record of our reservation. They tell me to call back in 15 min. I walk back to our car and a policeman is explaining to my daughter how she can't park where she is. I get back in the car and we start to drive back to Castellammare del Golfo. Antonella calls us while we are on the Autostrada and tells us to come back. We tell her that we are not impressed with Trapani (modern and charmless) or her agency and we are going back to Castellammare del Golfo. She says that she was waiting for us all morning. We tell her we want to cancel (it's obvious to us that there is no place nearby to park our rental car). She says: too late and we have to pay anyway (Booking.com policy). We decide to cancel anyway and go back to Castella where we can see our car from our hotel room.\n\nThis place might be OK as long as you don't have a car. Not impressed with the agency who handled this either\n\nBooking.com that says \u201cfree parking\u201d\nhttp:\/\/www.booking.com\/hotel\/it\/garibaldi31.en.html?aid=307415","30279":"Wanting to get out of Palermo having just arrived in Sicily, we drove off to the charming seaside town of Trapani and found this gem of an apartment. The view could not be beat nor the location. The apartment was immaculate and comfortable. The staff was very helpful with great recommendations for restaurants and touring( thank you Rosanna!). What a wonderful way to start our vacation!","30280":"We stayed 4 nights at Gaura apartments and loved our time. We stayed in apt 32, our friends in apt 42. The room is perfectly appointed-lots of cupboard space, shelves, even a place in the cupboard for our suitcases. The shower has a window with a view of the water. Hot shower and tons of water pressure. The bed is king size and faces the water so in the morning you can open the blinds to a stunning view of fishermen collecting their early morning catch. Of course there\u2019s the balcony with a view! My only regret is not spending enough time sipping wine on the balcony.\nGaura owners and staff were always available from the start of our emails right through to the end with booking restaurants for us. We started our trip to Sicily spoiled by a both the serenity of Trapani and the fabulous Gaura apartments.","30285":"My girlfriend and I stayed at the Gaura Apartments for only a single night, and we wished we had stayed longer! The apartment was so beautifully furnished, with a modern touch, and had stunning sprawling views of the ocean from the bathroom and the main living room. The views overlooking the decks and ocean were jaw-dropping. We were on the top (5th?) floor, with incredible views of the city and coastline. The room included some nice complimentary coffees and bottled waters. You will marvel in the views from this location and the staff was so very kind in their service and offering great local restaurant suggestions and helpful advice navigating the city. You will love your stay at Gaura for sure!","30289":"We were thrilled with our stay at Gaura. The apartment was clean. Bathroom were modern, The patio was terrific to watch the sunset. The beds was comfortable. There is a nice roof deck. Elevator access.\n\nThe front desk is at the Garcia Hotel on the corner. The entrance to Gaura is on the pedestrian walkway on the sea. It is located in old town. Close to shopping, restaurants and nightlife. We loved the location. The free parking lot is a 10 min walk straight down the street.","30312":"We stayed at Gaura for one week.\n\nThese apartments are *amazing*: their balconies are just meters from the sea! This means that the view (and sunsets) are really breathtaking.\n\nThe interior is very cozy, super clean and features what their website states (TVs which we didn't use, etc etc).\n\nPosition in comfortable and very close to Trapani's historic centre.\n\nStaff is friendly and gave us very good tips for restaurants as well.\n\nIf I could work remotely, I might think about buying one :)","30316":"As part of a full Sicilian immersion, we booked three days in Trapani. The Giardini Mon Plasir was a standout as we vetted possibilities for our stay. When you read the reviews, you quickly find a theme - elegant surroundings, fantastic service.\n\nFrom the minute we were greeted by the owner, Agostino and Alessandro, bartender, concierge and on-demand chef, we felt part of a noble family!\n\nThe villa is small (six generous rooms), with a garden, pool, cozy places to sit and enjoy a Sicilian mojito, and a true oasis in a sometimes busy city.\n\nLocation is superb, fifteen minutes walk to the funicular up to Erice. Literally a five minutes to an outstanding museum founded by Agostino\u2019s family.\n\nMozia Island, the salt flats and the Marsala wine production area makes a handy and fun day trip. We used Elena Rotkowska (rutkowska.elena@gmail.com) as a guide - superb!\n\nIn conclusion, our time in Trapani was special due to our stay at Giardini Mon Plaisir and the attention paid us by Alessandro and Agustino.\n\nBook it if you are lucky enough to find it available!","30317":"The stunning building has been in the owner's family for over 100 years. We - husband and two small children - were treated like treasured family friends. After a long journey, we were greeted with refreshing drinks and shown our beautiful room with historic features and modern style. The owner arranged a last minute reservation at a local restaurant where we had one of the best meals of our trip. Next morning, the breakfast with delicious homemade cakes and jam, ensured we started the day well. We can't wait to return to Giardini Mon Plaisir - and lovely Trapani, one of the great unmissable towns of Sicily.","30318":"We highly recommend this boutique hotel with its recently remodeled guest rooms and its delicious breakfast. The owner gave us excellent advice on what to do and see, and he got us reservations at local restaurants. This hotel has free, private parking, a swimming pool and a private garden. The bed was exceptionally comfortable and the bathroom remodel was superb with a large shower. We appreciated the genuine Sicilian hospitality.","30319":"The owner opened the gates and welcomed us with open arms to his beautiful estate. He showed us in and prepared for us a refreshing welcome lemonade and refreshing towels. He also gave us a short version of his family history, accompanied by some good and illustrative photos and blueprints on the walls, which provided some very interesting background.\n\nThe room was great: the bed was very comfortable, the bathroom was spacious, and there was simply no noise during the night. There was a spacious (upstairs) lounge with a huge window to let in a lot of daylight and provide a nice view on the beautiful garden and pool area.\n\nBreakfast was very good too. Very friendly waiter, very good coffee, fresh fruit and fruit juices, big selection of different kinds of food in general.","30320":"From the moment we arrived, Agostino - the owner - made us welcome and helped us with every aspect of our stay in Trapani. Our family had arranged for a gift to be sent to the room as part of a birthday celebration, for which Agostino made sure every detail was perfect. He helped us arrange restaurant reservations, and a taxi to take us there and back. He recommended excursions, and which of the sultan museums to visit. He is justifiably proud of the long family history of ownership, and willing to share the history. The room was large and well appointed - I think that this was the only time we found wine glasses and a corkscrew in a room on our trip! The bathroom had been renovated with high quality fixtures, and featured a large shower with a non-slip surface. The breakfast was excellent. The late afternoon honour bar at reasonable prices was a nice touch. The secure parking inside the gated compound is a real convenience. No hesitation in recommending for any length of stay.","30322":"This is what I wrote to the owner.\n\u201cThank you for your amazing and thoughtful hospitality.\nMy wife and I have traveled to many countries and stayed in a great many hotels but we have never had such a warm and gracious experience. You are to be commended. You went over and above at all times to make our stay at your beautiful ancestral home superb.\nA Birthday cake for our best friend at breakfast!! Fabulous. \u201c\n\nThere are 5 excellent guest rooms, each decorated with care and with great taste.","30323":"This is a true oasis and the best of both worlds - you get the services of a hotel, with the feeling of renting a villa. I really can't say enough good things.\n\n-The rooms are comfortable, quiet, and well appointed.\n-The pool was a treat at the end of each day, and the perfect temperature.\n-The breakfast was delicious and I loved the jar of preserves that they gave us when we left.\n-They have a very reasonably priced honesty bar so you can have a glass of wine or a drink in the evening before going out to dinner.\n-Having parking in Trapani was fantastic - the last time I was there I had to drive all over looking for a spot and make sure to move the car at specific times. This was so much easier!\n-The staff is so kind and helpful. Agostino, the owner, was very helpful in answering all my emails and helping me prebook a few restaurants. He had such terrific advice whenever we asked, and told us the history of the house.\n-The grounds are lovely and there are spots behind the house and around the pool to sit and chat and have a drink in the afternoon\/evening.\n-We called the same cab each night to take us into the historic center for dinner and then take us back. It's a quick drive and nice to be able to return to such a wonderful home afterwards.\n\nI stayed in late August for 5 nights. There were six of us in the group so we took 3 of the rooms. We had the Suite Exclusive- Roof Terrace, the Suite Deluxe, and a comfort room. They were all terrific. I liked being able to go up on the roof in the evening and we had everyone up there for drinks one night after swimming. It is small enough that it really did feel like renting your own villa!\n\nAgostino arranged for Alessandro to prepare a cookout for us in the garden one night. The food was spectacular and I highly recommend doing this. He grilled fresh fish, served delicious caponata and salads, and an amazing dessert. It was a real treat to sit in the garden and have such an incredible meal.\n\nI will definitely stay here again when I next return to Sicily (hopefully sooner than later)! It is such a gem of a spot and so easy to do day trips to Marsala, Mazara del Vallo, Erice, the Zingaro nature preserve, the Egadi islands, Segesta, Selinute, and more from here. It's a terrific base and I can't say enough good things about Giardini Mon Plaisir. It truly shows the warmth of the Sicilian experience.","30325":"The communication with Agostino from the moment we booked was superb and he made us feel welcome even before the gate to his magnificent guesthouse was opened. We stayed in the Blue Room for one night in September and could not have been happier with the experience. Giardini Mon Plaisir is an old family villa that has been restored with such love that is palpable on entering. Hard to imagine a place like this exists in the middle of the concrete highrises that surround it. One gets lost in the tranquility once inside. Alessandro was helpful in getting us settled. Loved the honor bar that we have used in so many other places. It just makes one feel at home!\nThe location is excellent for those arriving by car. There is secured free parking. Best to just leave your car and explore the area by foot. There are plenty of restaurants that the hotel recommends. It is a 15 minute walk to the Erice Cable Car and a short taxi ride to the Old Town (approx \u20ac10 and taxi drivers were exceptionally nice). We were fortunate to be there during \"The City Revealed\" and enjoyed seeing the indoors of such fabulous buildings in the Old Town. We truly had a memorable stay.\nOur mistake was to only stay one night; we could easily have spent 3 nights here, enjoying the pool and gardens. Next time!\nNote: See photos below as the numbering on the street is a bit illogical.","30328":"We stayed here for a week and we were extremely happy that we did. The property is stylish and relaxing, a great place to be at anytime of the day, especially after exploring the island. The rooms are beautifully presented, cool, calm and in keeping with the the style of the house. I stayed in the deluxe suite, which was just lovely. The breakfast was amazing, with local produce and home made treats. I have to say the service was impeccable, nothing is to much trouble for the owner and his team, always there for advice on restaurants and places to visit.\nAn amazing stay, thank you very much.","30330":"thanks Agostino, we had a wonderful time staying at your hotel, private, quiet relaxing and great attention to detail...\n\nso easy, absolutely no idea what you could do to make it a better stay.\n\neasy private parking, great pool","30332":"With a last minute reservation we couldn't possibly receive a warmer welcome at this fantastic hotel. We didn't even occupy the room yet but our dinner was already booked in a recommended restaurant we chose :) Our room was spacious, well equipped, and perfectly clean. Starting the next day with a nice breakfast in the garden (with fresh fruit & we could also taste local specialties, including home made pastry and jam!), and we didn't miss some refreshing time in the pool. Thank you, \"Giardini Mon Plaisir\" for the experience!","30341":"Inside your walled compound with a nice garden is your home away from home. Recently renovated with high end fixtures, the owner has left touches of the original structure to dramatic effect. High ceilings and private balconies make for a splendid residence. The breakfast is excellent. The vibe is cool. I give this inn my highest rating!","30342":"We enjoyed our stay at this hotel. The building itself is beautiful. The room was super big and clean, the breakfast was excellent and there is a nice refreshing pool. The owner (also speaks French) is very sympathic and he gave us lots of suggestions. We recommend without hesitation!","30343":"My husband and I along with few friends stayed in this beautiful hotel during our visit to Sicily and we enjoyed our stay a lot. The hotel is conveniently located walking distance to the cable car to Erice. The breakfast was phenomenal. The owner is extremely helpful and friendly. The hotel itself was recently renovated and rooms are very clean, comfortable and modern. I highly recommend this hotel and would stay there again in a heartbeat!","30344":"Perfect place: beautiful small, family- owned hotel, with charming owner, helpful staff and welcoming atmosphere. Rooms are spacious and furnitured without unneccessary pomp but surely with a sense of style. Breakfast served inside (beautiful interiors with nice view on the garden) or outside leaves you with the full stomach and impression of beeing at home or at least at some familiar, cosy place where you do feel really good.Great pool area and garden, private parking place means also a lot but what make s a real difference for me is intime atmosphere, calmness of the place and a personal contact with the owner who offers his time and knowledge about the city, restautants, artists etc. I wish we have stayed longer than one night and we will definitely come back.","30345":"On arrival, at check in, our host noticed that it was my wife\u2019s birthday the prior day. We went out for lunch and on our return there was a beautiful bunch of flowers on our bed.\nThis place is very special. The room is first class and service is impressive.","30347":"Can not recommend this hotel enough. This is a lovely little boutique hotel and a true Oasis in the city. The pool area and gardens are delightful and peaceful, rooms are very nice, well equipped and very clean.\n\nAgostino was very welcoming, and every night recommended a restaurant for us and booked us a taxi (the hotel is about 30min walk from the centre of town, but buses and taxis are very easy and cheap). Every restaurant recommended was amazing, serving delicious Sicilian food.\n\nA simple breakfast was provided, with fresh and delicious food and coffee. Just what you need to start the day, and even included some marmalades from the garden.\n\nReally wish I could have stayed in this hotel for more than 3 nights!\n\nThanks again for having us, and for the amazing experience. I hope to stay here again soon!","30359":"Incredible boutique hotel! The place is lovely, service is the top of the top, the host will make you feel very special, they will think about your needs before you even think about them. It\u2019s a romantic place and since it is a small hotel and the staff leaves after 7:30pm, you will feel totally at home with privacy. The only down side are the buildings all around it but we forgot about them very quickly. A bit expensive for a room with no balcony\/terras (in compare to other places we stayed in Sicily) but it was worth it!","30361":"Stylish and comfortable family house that has been converted into a boutique hotel by the host\/owner who was both hospitable and extremely knowledgeable about the area and beyond. Willing to point us in the right direction to find restaurants to suit our mood. Delightful gardens with a swimming pool (not used by us in April but a must for later in the summer). Parking was a boon.","30365":"What a surprise when you arrive at this lovely place! You approach via a residential area, where you would not expect any boutique hotel - and then the gates open into a lovely courtyard and garden, and to a wonderful old villa. You feel transported into another place and time, feel immediately well and at ease - and forget in a minute that you\u2019re not somewhere in the countryside but basically in walking distance to Trapani centre and to the cablecar taking you up to Erice! A very stylish house altogether, also our room was extremely comfortable, deocrated in a modern-cosy style. We even had our own roof terrace! Agostino is a very distinguished host, with plenty of recommendations and real dedication to make his guests feel like friends in his home. The breakfast is fresh and abundant, and there is a swimming pool for the warmer months. Perfect place as a couple, but I could imagine also as a group of friends or family to occupy the entire place. Truly a special place!","30367":"Giardini Mon Plaisir is an oesis in Trapani. I stayed here with my family few days in December 2017. Agostino - the owner - is an amazing host. The villa is fully refurbished - rooms are nice and clean - I recommend this hotel to everybody staying in Trapani.","30370":"We stayed 3 nights. Agostino made us feel at home from the moment we \"moved in\". Very comfortable room on 1st floor off large common lounge area, overlooking back garden and pool. The \"Happy\" afternoon time is a great opportunity to meet other guests. It really is an oasis which has kept its historic character when carefully modernised, despite surrounded by modern suburbia. After Palermo, it was a perfect place to relax.\nIt is 4km from the centre of \"old\" city, walkable or bus. Agostino's restaurant recommendations were helpful and the taxi he recommended also excellent.\nHighly recommended.","30372":"A place like home...the converted old villa that was the owner's grandfather's home was renovated and now hosts six bedrooms. The decor and the grounds surrounding the villa are simply grand....and the service compliments all the above...the villa is away from the centre but still close....highly recommended for a break, a small wedding with a great setting in the garden that surrounds the villa and even a top end discreet business hotel. AGOSTINO the owner just hands over the villa and it's yours for a weekend...well done and thanks AGOSTINO.","30373":"Exceeded our expectations in every aspect. This is an inner city sanctuary which achieves the delicate balance between attentive hosting and laissez faire. It was perfect for us, parents and 2 children (5 and 2) as we had the security of the perimeter wall plus the beautiful well kept swimming pool to cool off after a day getting hot and bothered at the surrounding attractions. In fact, it wasn't long before the kids had decided that they didn't want to go out anymore! To top it all, we were even allowed to use the kitchen in the evening which meant we could truly relax and et al fresco in the gorgeous gardens of the house. Agostino is a perfect and very knowledgeable host who will be sure to make your stay the best. Would happily book again if I am ever in Trapani again for either business or pleasure.","30376":"We had two rooms for two nights in this beautiful house, breaking up a fly-drive around Sicily. It was fascinating to hear about the history of this country manor which has been restored to a high standard with a mix of antique furniture and modern fittings.The original tiled floors from the 1920s are stunning and remains of coloured wall frescoes give the rooms their names - we were in the 'blue' room. Not quite a hotel, not quite a BnB, you feel like a family guest. You can come and go with the code to the front door, and the system operates on trust - take a drink from the fridge, or an aperitif in the evening, and write down what you had. Breakfast was served with a selection of homemade jams from fruit from the garden and honey from the local area. If you fancy a relaxing day by the pool, you can put in a lunch order and have it served beneath the trees. The portions were generous and delicious. Trapani itself was not one of our favourite places, and the hotel was surrounded by blocks of flats. The hotel and gardens are literally a little oasis in the middle of a built-up area. It means that if you're by the pool you do feel a little bit on show, in that all the flats can look down on you, although to be fair most of the flats had shuttered windows. We were there in the middle of a heat wave, so the pool was most welcome. The air conditioning wasn't quite cold enough for us at night - probably struggling in the heat. All-in-all an immaculate, unique place where we felt well looked after.","30390":"Traveling with a family of four - two teenagers. The room was spacius (actually two conecting rooms), the AC was good (it was 35 degrees outside...), easy to find parking in the street outside, close to shops and restaurants. Breakfast better than most places; bread, ham, cheese, juice, coffe as you request, fruit and the usual cakes and jam +++ Fantastic roof top terrasse with view over the city. Will stay here again!","30392":"My stay at Granveliero was a surprise!Giovanni was really friendly and upgraded our room, which was equivalent to a 5 star hotel. Breakfast was excellent,too. What else could anyone expect from a BnB?","30395":"In the centre of the old town, this B and B is situated in a renovated apartment building; each room being an old apartment. Very cosy and well presented, the rooms have kept a lot of their charm and offer a very good nights sleep.\n\nParking is on street but we never had a problem finding a spot.\n\nThe breakfast is not extensive but of very good quality.\n\nVery good base to visit Trapani or make day trips to the local islands.\n\nWifi was offered but did not work.","30414":"it was nice experience in granvelerio .Giovanni and anna are very helpful.the breakfast was nice even the room big and spacesious .the cleaness was brilliant,what we want to say there s no lifts.you have to go up by stairs .although we was in the first floor,we didn't recomanded for old people that wont walk up the stairs for 3 or 4 th floor.","30463":"Tasty breakfast (coffee, sweets and other products like ham, cheese etc.), spacious apartment (apartment called \u2018Sole\u2019), separate entrance to the building. Perfect location in the beginning of historical area and close to very cheap parking (0.10 EUR per hour). Although it was an apartment, there was a room cleaning. Good responsiveness from the host (Manola) before our arrival - we got answers for all our questions.\n\nWhen we entered the apartment, there was a heavy smell of detergents (probably after cleaning). Later on, it was replaced by smell from sewers. Weak water pressure in the shower. The biggest issue was that we were surprised by lack of hot water in the morning after our first night. Fortunately, the problem was fixed a couple of hours after we told about it. No WiFi range in bedroom of the apartment. The \u2019Sole\u2019 apartment was pretty dark. Also, I asked a couple of times if it\u2019s ok to checkout at 9am and I was told it\u2019s ok but on the check-out day the breakfast staff needed to wake up someone because they didn\u2019t speak English.","30476":"We booked an other guesthouse but were redirected to Guesthouse Garibaldi. Absolut pleased with it. Really nice compartment in the middle of the city. Big, quiet comfortable room, it's easy to get to the city centre. Nice inner garden","30497":"The advantage of the place is the location: at the beginning of the pedestrian areas and easy to park your car in the public parking area.\nThe B&B is pretty basic: rooms on three different floors but it seems that they should be renovated in terms of forniture (bed was not confortable at all, only few water from the lavabo). Prices are not high, but they could do much more!","30529":"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Hotel Vittoria. The lobby area is very inviting and comfortable. Our room was a great size and the bathroom was huge by European hotel standards. The breakfast was plentiful and delicious and the staff were absolutely wonderful! Just a short walk to the ocean as well as the old part of the city. Definitely recommend!!","30544":"We arrivered in the evening and our luggage was brought to our room by the hotel employee. There is a big parking area direct in front of the hotel for 0.10 \u20ac\/hours. By a 5 min walk you are in the center and 15 min to the port.\nWe got an extraordinarily nice room with a lot of space and very clean. The bath was brand new and spacious.\nThe employees were more than friendly and helpful.\nThe breakfast buffet was complete for us.\nThe reception allowed us to leave our baggage in the hotel for 1 night because we travelled to Favignana for 1 1\/2 days.\nI would recommend this hotel in Trapani.","30551":"very best welcome, clean and tidy large room, excellent service and breakfast, first hotel we found with one german tv, near harbor and town center, even if it was rather cold in february heater was in function and we had a warm room","30561":"We have felt so welcomed and appreciated here at our stay in Hotel Vittoria. The front desk staff have gone way out of their way to make tour arrangements for us because most all tour agencies have closed for the season. They have been patient and accommodating. Thank you!\nOur room is very comfortable, modern, spacious and spotlessly clean with many amenities.\nThe breakfast has a variety of meats and cheeses, pastries, buns and cakes, cereals, yogurts, fruits etc. There were boiled eggs as well.\nThe location is excellent. It is just on the edge of the old town and port where there are many fine restaurants and shops. The public bus to get to Erice is very close.","30577":"yes this is a nice cozy hotel; I stayed here 3 nights, the place is clean and recently\nrenowated; breakfast are quite good and abundant.\nlocation is also quite good to walk to the centre and also to walk to the beach.\nI can recommend this place.","30586":"Really close to all the main shops, but about ten to fifteen minutes walk from the main historic part of Trapani, where the bars and restaurants are located. This was a good place to stay in an ideal location.\n\nGood size clean room, side view of the sea, and nice bathroom. I think I will ask for a shower cubicle for the next visit, as although there was good water pressure, it was difficult to avoid getting the floor covered in water, as there was a shower curtain.\n\nReception staff very friendly, and breakfast staff, although not overly engaging, were very efficient. A good Italian selection was provided for breakfast, and it set us up for the day.\n\nMuzzico restaurant, within 20 metres, is an excellent place, if you want to eat locally.\n\nThis seems like a good 3 star hotel )but listing is 4), typically Italian, and I look forward to staying here again.","30617":"Renovated B & B, modern furnishings and utilities, great breakfast. Parking on the street (paid or not, you choose), but this is so in almost every B & B. Alessandra is very kind and the B & B offers food (cakes, teas, etc.) anytime.","30620":"This is a great choice in Trapani. Sitting above the avenue of trees on Viale Regina Elina (esplanade) in the old town, the location has excellent harbour views.\n\nAlessandra is a wonderful host. She is also the owner and took over the business recently. She is justifiably proud of her lovely B&B. She carried out extensive renovations that took six months to complete. The result is a clean and comfortable group of rooms within a very old building. All the modern amenities worked perfectly. There are stairs to negotiate but we did not find that to be a problem.\n\nWe found Alessandra to be helpful, flexible and most hospitable. She met us right on time even though we had to change our arrival time twice. She also provided good information about the Trapani attractions of which there are many. We were not going to go to Favinana Island due to limited time but did at her suggestion and we are so glad we did. What a magical place that is!\n\nThe room is light and airy with a lovely balcony. The bed is very comfortable and the bathroom is brand new.\n\nAlessandra and Paola put on a lovely breakfast \u2013 better than we have come to expect in Italy.\n\nYou\u2019ll need to book way ahead in the season, but grab a room here if you can.","30640":"Great little place. Interesting rooms and pleasant owners\/staff. Breakfast was fine and included local pastries. The rooms overlook a busy street so expect and bit of noise, but the views over the bay, marina and watching the ferries leave are worth the small trade off.","30712":"Where to start : we spend 3 days there and I wish it was more.\n\nLocation : perfect strategic place, we wanted to visit Trapani, Marsala, Erice and Kitesurf on the Stagnone. Well this B&B is in the middle of all of this and you get the advantages of being outside the site : easy parking, no noises ... You can find very nice restaurants in the area ( try Vultaggio )\n\nThe hotel : the room was very comfortable, super clean, AC, TV, very nice bathroom with italian shower, room was cleaned every day. Delicious breakfast with homemade pies, cheese, salami, eggs ... Also they just put an amazing swimming pool in the garden !\n\nThe owners : they are lovely. Family run business, Maria Pia, Giusi and Mario are very welcoming, they make you fell like at home.\n\nGrazie mille !","30818":"Let me start with the important part - we did not stay in this hostel in the end, because there was some \"renovation\" done and the owner had to move us to a different place. We stayed at that place just for one night and did not like it one bit. So this review is not about the quality of our stay, but rather about our experience with the customer service here.\n\nWe have reserved the stay for four nights way ahead and we were really looking forward to it. A day before we arrived, the owner called me to ask me when we will arrive. I told him the time and he told me he will be waiting for us.\n\nWhen we arrived into the city a day later, we rang the bell for the reception, but nobody answered. We managed to catch the owner after 15 minutes of buzzing and he promised he will be right with us. After another 15 minutes, he came down and told us (in very bad english) that there is some kind of renovation going on and he cannot place us at the hostel, but he will show us to a place nearby. The \"nearby\" place was a good 15 minute walk away on the other end of the center, but that was still fine with us.\n\nHowever the new place was not up to the standard we expected - it was a tad too dirty and it smelled weird. After a round of talking we decided to stay just one night and leave in the morning for a better (and cheaper!) hostel we found nearby.\n\nMy issue is that the owner could (and should) have told us this beforehand so we could make a decision. He did not. To top it off the calls we had to make with him were very hard and unnecessarilly long (bad english + bad hearing make for a not-so-fun experience).","30832":"Optimal position, nearly port, nearly beach \/500m\/, nearly to center town, simply room, good brekfeast on the room, TV on the room, internet no good work, this time reconstruction building, good parking nearly hotel -no pay.","30998":"The room we were given was not shown in any of the photos available at the booking site. The bath was dirty (dirt and pubic hairs), pillow was dirty (likely wasn't changed after previous guests), towels dirty with holes. Internet was non functional in our room. The worst of all was that we couldn't sleep until 3am, because of the noise from the street. Breakfast was 1 croissant and coffee in a bar near by and was tasty. Friendly advice is to avoid.","31005":"From arrival to departure, very nice.\nWe arrived late in the evening by plane. But there was no problem with the check in. We had the superior rooms. Very big Nice rooms. Every morning the cleaning lady. Beds were made. Great service. NO water cooker but a fridge in the main hall. Very nice!","31239":"although our visit was only one night, Donatella, made us feel right at home. she even helped navigate our car out of the tiny streets surrounding the B&B. she offered great advice regarding roads and site-seeing and was a delight. the room was small, but comfortable. the breakfast, charming served on the roof. it was enchanting for a short stay.. perfect location!","31255":"Positive: Nicely decorated B&B, good bed. Negatives: no free parking within 2 miles, we saw the owner only upon reception to collect our money, he then disappeared for good; breakfast consists of prepackaged cookies, no tea or coffee in the morning (self-service machine was broken), shower is broken, bathroom sink is broken, burglary alarm started beeping at 7 in the morning for no reason, dirty kitchen.","31318":"First, the positives: Our group of four had a clean place to sleep very near the port and less than two blocks from a very lively passaggiata.\n\nWhat we didn't get:\n\n-- Access to a terrace;\n-- A useful street map and orientation conversation;\n-- Initially, the number of beds we booked;\n-- Any kind of apology for putting us in the apartment of some friend (who apparently cleared out fast, leaving documents, toothpaste, clothing and other personal things behind);\n-- Instructions about which buzzer to ring if someone wanted to be let into our unnumbered apartment.\n\nThe lodging we got was adequate and appropriate for this price point. However, there are some basics of good hospitality that were missing here. Good hosts tell their guests a little about the town. (We found stores and restaurants on our own with no help or advice from them). Good hosts don't make their guests chase them from building to building to try to pay for their lodging and recover their passport. Good hosts who find they have to substitute something different than expected will explain why instead of saying over and over, \"This is all just for you. The whole place. All for you. You only booked just a room for four and we're giving you an apartment.\"\n\nThough I understand why Pietro tried to relentlessly focus on the positive, it made me feel a little railroaded. And since I was very clear in my e-mail that I needed two twin beds for a grown sister and teen-aged brother, our stay started on a sour note when he presented a small pull-out couch for them to share and then was surprised when we asked for a rollaway.\n\nHe gets points for fixing that by showing up a few hours later with a rollaway and bedding.\n\nThis establishment seems to be run by nice people who get stretched a little thin.\n\nI wish I could review the main property, but the closest I got to it was the lobby when I paid the bill.\n\nWe had been looking forward to breakfast on the terrace and to sitting on the terrace between our visits to Segesta and Erice. From the street below it looked nice; we'll have to leave others to review that part.\n\nAs for breakfast, for our two-night stay for four people, we were given a total of four yogurts, two single-serving juices and a large amount of packaged toasts, croissants and jellies to share. Half a yogurt and a quarter of a juice per person per day didn't turn out to be a problem because our group didn't include big breakfast eaters. If anyone had wanted a whole glass of juice in the morning there were places nearby where we could have supplemented what was provided.\n\nIf you're flexible and you don't have a specific expectation -- or don't have a group that needs a specific bed configuration -- this B&B could work for you just fine.\n\nI was disappointed.","31335":"Very comfortable, close to the port. Nice terrace too. Marilena was away the next day so gave us a voucher for breakfast (coffee and pastry) at a cafe down the road. Only criticism would be that there was a bit of black mildew in the shower cubicle; otherwise all clean with a very comfortable mattress.","31338":"We stayed at another B&B at first, which was really wonderful. When we moved we were afraid that the new hostel would not be as good, but we got a lovely surprise when we arrived. The greeting was nice, our room was clean and spacey, and the terass was great.\n\nBreakfast included brioche, milk, cereal, coffee, juice and cake, so that was all fine too.\n\nGreat place to spend a couple of days at when in Trapani, the location is perfect just next to the main streets of the old town.","31341":"La Terrazza sul Porto in Trapani is the perfect place to relax and unwind. It is a very comfortable unassuming place and Marilena and her husband are both terrific. It has all the qualities of a home from home and you are made to feel very welcome and part of a large family. It is also conveniently close to the port and to the bus stops. We will definitely be returning.","31355":"Staff helped us park the car in a free parking place, transported us and the luggage to the B&B which is a car restricted area.\nFantastic warm and plentifull breakfast by Maria who also helped with info about the town","31358":"When we arrived at this establishment we were rather taken aback as the entrance was not what we expected, but don't let that put you off. Once you realise the style of the buildings have similar facades then you know that's how things are.\nThe property has 3 guest bedrooms, 2 with ensuite, and 1 with it's own private bathroom out in the hall. Our room was with ensuite and a small balcony overlooking the street.\nThe shower cubicle was a little claustrophobic, so don't drop the soap, but otherwise the facilities were okay.\nThe bedroom was quite large and had TV, fridge and tea\/coffee making facilities with complementary tea, coffee and sugar.\nThe furniture was looking a bit tired, but everything was functional and the room was kept very clean.\nBreakfast was served in the kitchen diner, but could also be served in your room. The breakfast was excellent with a wide range of rolls, cakes etc. delicious.\nThe location of the property was just a few minutes walk from the centre where many bars, restaurants and cafes are situated in the pedestrianised street.\nThe staff at the establishment were absolutely lovely; so friendly and helpful and for this reason plus the location I have given the score as excellent.","31396":"I am a senior adult experienced world traveler, picky but not overly so, who does much research before choosing a lodging and so am rarely disappointed.\nLOCATION: at the west (seaside, point) end of the peninsula of oldtown historic section of Trapani. quieter, very quaint, pleasant, safe area, a bit of a hike from the bus station, but possible. near the historic center.\nBUILDING: one-flight up apartment in historic town house\nTYPE: rooms in apartment\nCLEANLINESS: spotless\nPERSONEL\/HOST: friendly man with perfect english who will answer any questions about where to dine, etc.\nROOM: cheerful good sized room\nBATH: decent sised, not euro-tiny\nVIEW: of street from balcony\nBREAKFAST: adequate, typical B&B fare\nNOISE: very quiet inside and from the street. NO street noise !!\nCOMFORT: comfortable bed and room\nPUBLIC COMPUTER\/WIFI: don't know about wifi\nSUM-UP: i was very happy here and enjoyed the walk from the bus station through the old town, glad i chose this place. eat at salamureci, the restaurant at the north end of the street, then out on the main street.","31468":"We had been looking forward to this at the end of our stay in Sicily and unfortunately it really took the shine off a wonderful trip. The hotel is grim and shabby. rotting window frames, tired decor. It is located in an area that didnt feel that safe and the parking was actually two blocks away on the road. Our car was OK but we felt worried about it nonetheless as the area feels a bit dodgy. Staff were nice and helpful. breakfast was fine, no problem there. Quite limited on facilities, the internet was basically non-functional, the towels were old, only two tiny sachets of hair shampoo, no conditioner, and no soap to wash hands with. All just a bit grim really. We had two weeks in Sicily and this was not value for money at all. Recommend finding somewhere else. there are some lovely places just around the corner!!!","31481":"The hotel was comfortable, the staff friendly and most of all it is situated in the centre of Trapani. The breakfast was really good and it varies from one day to another. When we wanted to visit nearby ERICE the staff immediately told us that they will phone a driver to take us. A few minutes after the driver came and took us to the Funicular which takes you to Erice. Then when ready we just phoned him and came to pick us up, all for a reasonable price.","31585":"Great position, beautiful rooms, amazing staff and high standard cleanline\nWhat can you ask more?\nHigh recommended\nLooking forward to come back soon\nThank you very much for everything guys, you made our holiday unforgettable","31587":"Great appartement and location, close to the habour and in the middle of the old town.\nRestaurants, Cafes and Bars are just round the corner. Giuseppe is a very friendly and helful guy. Highly recommended.","31589":"We stayed at Marina Bay apartments for 2 nights, but would have loved to have stayed longer. The location is wonderful, as it is close to the port, restaurants and sights. As we are travelling by bus, it was very welcoming to find the apartment was very close to the bus station and tourist information office. The staff were outstanding in providing advice, directions and recommendations. This made our stay very relaxed. The apartment was modern, clean and had a fantastic rooftop terrace.\nWe would definitely stay here again and recommend it to anyone wanting a relaxing holiday.","31590":"The hotel is situated at the heart of the old town and as our apartment had the terrace we had a wonderful space to enjoy the sun and the views of the city and the hills.\n\nThe hotel is well managed and the team are wonderfully helpful and friendly. I am already looking forward to revisiting .","31592":"Clean, comfortable, self catering Apts in the centre but also near the dockside. The apts are basic but well equipped. The hotel staff are very welcoming and helpful. .They can also arrange day trips to nearby Florio island or chauffeur service to nearby villages if you do not have a car. If you come by car parking might be problematic in the limited zones. The centre boasts of many restaurants, churches, museums etc..the usual attractions of a historic centre. Marina bay apthotel is a good base for travel to the many areas of interest in and around Trapani","31674":"For the people who likes sunshine and breakfast in balcony and a very home atmosphere, this would be the best place to step in. The hostel was very clean and tidy and comfortable place, the internet was functioning all the time and for the people who loves music, there is a piano in the living room which can be used when you want chill and relax... there is also a mini library where you can borrow books or dvds to watch when you want to relax after having an exhausting day. Ignazio was really a friendly person who welcomed and described everything in detail and also gave helped with all our requirements when needed, I would personally recommend this hostel to be a good place with good hospitality to have an enjoyable stay.","31675":"The two of us stayed at this hotel because of trip advisor and the price was a little more than the poorly reviewed hostels. The owner was very nice, allowed us to pick our room, borrowed us a corkscrew & 2 glasses, and gave us free mountain bikes to use the entire stay and not have to return until we checked out! The owner speaks English as well and gave us good advice on some places to get food.\nThe room is nice, breakfast (included) is nice too. The hotel is on a main road and can be a little noisy at night. But don't let this deter you, it's a good place and worth the price!","31676":"My experience staying here with my husband was one of the most bizarre and at times scary experiences I've ever had travelling. And that is saying a lot!\n\nThe place itself is lovely. The rooms were spotless, bed super comfy and our double room opened onto the large communal balcony where breakfast is served - so we were happy as punch our first day. Ignazio the owner seemed a bit quiet, but we didn't read too much into it figuring maybe his English was just bad.\n\nOur second morning, we woke up and headed outside for breakfast which is served at 8:30 until 10. The previous morning Ignazio had taken nearly 20 mins to get breakfast ready, so we figured we'd come a bit later. We went outside and the table was all set with plates and glasses and the kitchen doors were open, but no sign of Ignacio or any of the bread, marmalade, cheese, etc from the previous day. We waited about 5 minutes and still no sign of Ignazio, so we tried calling his name and knocking on the kitchen door, but still nothing. We were starting to get a little bored and it was nearly 9:30 (we'd thought) so finally my husband decided to call Ignazio's mobile phone. Ignazio came running to the kitchen and my husband explained that is was only him calling and to our shock Ignazio slammed the kitchen doors and left us standing outside! About 10 mins later, he came back and started putting some coffee out during which time I'd realised that we'd forgotten that the clocks had gone back for daylight saving's time and that in fact we'd been 5 (yes FIVE) minutes early for breakfast. I tried to apologise to Ignazio - who instead slammed a clock down on the table next to me and only answered 'Yep' in a really [-] way when I asked him if the clocks had gone back. Amazing! It was so ridiculously over the top and rude that we were speechless.\n\nAfter breakfast we borrowed some of his bikes (he made us give him a 40 EUR deposit) and about 20 minutes after we'd left, Ignazio called us on our mobile phone asking if we could come back to the B&B because he'd forgotten to register our passports. When we answered that we were already 5 kms from town, he said, \"Well I have your passports\". My husband asked me if I'd ever given him our passports - and when I said 'No', he asked Ignazio how he'd gotten hold of our passports, and Ignazio simply said 'I'll see you tonight at 8' and hung up. And when we returned to the B&B later, Ignazio told us that he'd gone through our things and taken our passports! My husband was furious and wanted to call the police and I was absolutely stunned! He'd gone into our room and through my bag and taken our passports without even asking us!\nWe tried to confront him about it and all he did was demand his bicycle lock back and only then did he give us our passports back and our 40 EUR deposit. He said that he'd forgotten to register us with the local police department within 24 hours (in keeping with local law) and so he'd gone into our room and through our things.\n\nFor the rest of our last night staying at the B&B we both felt really creeped out and uncomfortable. Ignazio comes across as a very angry and irrational person who clearly lacks both the personal skills and sense of humanity that I think is needed to work in the hospitality industry. I wouldn't recommend a stay here to anyone - no one deserves to be made to feel so awkward while staying as a paying guest, and certainly NO ONE has the right to into your room and through your belongings!\n\nIgnazio not just a terrible host but his behaviour is completely innappropriate, and I would say, illegal.","31751":"Great location, handy to the autostrada and roads to Erice and other local attractions, airports in Trapani and Palermo (45 minutes). Warm welcome, large and tastefully, minimalist, decorated rooms with large bathrooms. We were there two nights and dined very well, on locally sourced produce - so well that we asked for, and were given recipes. We'd recommend it as a base for the region, and for those who would prefer to avoid the traffic\/chaos of Palermo.","31777":"Palazzo dei Corsari is housed in a restored historic building dating back to the 16th century and has been inhabited for centuries by shipowners and privateers in the center of the historic center of Trapani. It still survives many traces of ancient history: a stone staircase, open beams, windows and arches.\nHowever, everything else leaves the desire to be better. The service is almost the same as in all the apartments. Bedclothes, old, sometimes torn. Reception is only a few hours a day. The only advantage is this great location.","31851":"We booked via booking.com for an 8 night stay at the end of September.\nFor sightseeing old Trapani, eating out and spending time relaxing at the beach the location of\nPalazzo dei Poeti is perfect.\n\nIt is a very beautiful 18th century Italian villa located behind impressive wooden doors just a few minutes walk from a range of bars restaurants and designer shops and slightly longer jaunt to the port and local beaches.\n\nOur ground floor one bedroom apartment had a slightly weird layout with a narrow lounge, kitchen, bathroom and terraced area furnished throughout in a modern style with a large double bed, one wardrobe and ample drawers, table and chairs, sofa and bedroom chair.\nThe kitchen was clean, very basically equipped with little enough storage for anyone wanting to cook proper meals.\nBut as we like to eat out every day we only made ourselves coffee and cold drinks in the room. The fridge was in the lounge area at end opposite the kitchen and the kettle needed to be on the floor to reach a plug socket unfortunately.\n\nA large modern well equipped bathroom with a washing machine added was good if a little dark.\n\nThe apartment was cleaned once during our 8 day stay, not particularly well (perhaps I'm a bit too fussy) but all towels\/bedding replaced. One loo roll supplied at beginning of stay and again on cleaning day. So perhaps remember to buy\/bring your own if you are in need of a more generous allowance for your stay.\n\nThe apartment had a damp smell and a dehumidifier supplied needed to be on and emptied frequently - due to local climate I guess.\n\nWe felt the apartment was not particularly well sound proofed - work being done upstairs until around 5:30pm by builders was quite noisy so generally we didn't use the patio\/terrace area other than to dry our beach towels and kept windows closed at night.\n\nJust a few things to note:-\n\nThe hotel was not easy to find being off a one way system where street names are shortened and not as listed on the hotel's website (google maps sent us round and round several streets on foot with suitcases until my feet ached and my eyesight not being great we walked past the building several times. Signage of some sort would have helped.\n\nThe hotel IS located just behind the large postal office building at Vialo Regina Margherita on junction between Via Cavour and Via Bernardo (Bonaluto).\n\nThere is no parking on site - if travelling by car use the nearest 'free' public car park (about 600m away) and be aware\n'free' parking here means...isn't quite completely free as it seems to be 'run' by a group of fellas who are a little bit pushy for a few \u20ac's in return for finding you a space even when car park empty. We managed to get away with it a few times by insisting it was supposed to be free and that we could pay on our return but they were very persistent and sometimes it was easier to just pay. No one bar a few confident locals seemed to manage to avoid giving the 'donation'!\n\nIn conclusion Palazzo dei Poeti was perfect for its\nlocation perhaps just not ideal for our vacation accommodation.","31876":"Beautiful and clean hotel which is centrally located. Would like to thank the staff of the hotel. My 13 year old daughter left a watch and bracelet which are of a sentimental value at the hotel. They called us after we left and every day until we collected these items. Much appreciated.","31932":"Wonderful ,best price ,clean ,spacious,lovely staff,best location and beautiful surrounding in old town Trapani.Would love to stay again.Breakfast in a cafe nearby...ok not brilliant but lopvely coffe and friendly staff ,and great taste for cheese","31996":"Despite its excellent location this place for my wife and I at least was a disappointment. We stayed in the depence (annex). This self catering apartment had obviously recently been decorated,and re-equipped. It had brand new washing machine,microwave and fridge \/ freezer. but the workmanship was not of a particularly high or tasteful standard.Even though the white goods were new the were inconvenient to use in as far as there was only 1 plug adaptor that fitted the numerous sockets seemingly located in the wrong positions . The kettle had to placed on the floor next to the sink unit as the length of lead did not allow it to be used anywhere else in the kitchen area.The toilet seat was a virtual deathtrap.. It had a vicious sudden sideways slew whenever you sat on it, nearly frightening you to death. It was also a noisy area mainly due to the adjoining apartment building was having extensive building work being done to it. We were awakened at a very early hour one morning to the sound of Acrow props being \"thrown into\" the back of a pick-up truck. Not quite the peace and tranquility I had imaged on making the booking. Sad to say this was the least favorite place to stay during our 3 week stay in Southern Italy. Maybe OK for young fit families who can handle a small narrow switchback of a staircase easily, but for \"old fogies\" it lacked a lot of the comforts of home.","32023":"First, like many Sicilian B&B's the location is hard to find even with a GPS. The apartment we stayed in was large with a comfortable bed.\nThe real surprise is the owner had his Nephew guide us with his car to a Municipal parking lot for our car and then show us places to eat. When I noticed there was a washing machine they actually washed our clothes for free.\nFinally, the breakfast that was included was very good.","32053":"Everything started with a plan for a quick long weekend break away from the hectic life. Out of all the Italian cities we opted to go to Trapani, which is only 25 minutes away from Malta and directly connected.\n\nI was spoilt for choice but wanted an comfy apartment for my family. During the research La Mattanza came up and from the already good ratings and pictures I soon fell in love with the place and felt that La Mattanza will suit my family needs. And I was right.\n\nThe residence in itself is located in one of many narrow streets of Trapani centre, and only 5 minutes walk from the main activities. What impressed me most is the friendliness of the management and staff of La Mattanza. Upon our arrival my family was greeted by Martzia and Mary who were managing the reception and bar on the day. During the check in, we were offered a coffee as a welcome drink and Martzia was very patient and helpful in explaining the things to do and places to visit within Trapani and the whereabouts. Martzia also gave us a list of restaurants and places that offer Trapanese delicacies, which basically left us spoilt for choice in every location and direction that we visited. We were treated more like friends other than paying customers and this was greatly appreciated. We continued to receive the same level of supreme customer service throughout the two and a half days that we spent in Trapani.\n\nThe Apartment:-\nMy family was given Apartment Nasse which is on the 3rd floor of the building. Despite that the block is located in the old part of the town, the residence has got a lift which we could use to take the luggages up and down; the lift can take up to two people at a time, but despite the small size the lift was very convenient.\nA number of important features of the apartment are that most importantly the apartment is spacious, with two separate large bedrooms (the main was approx 5m x 5m whereas the second bedroom was approx 6m x 2.5m). The living area was more or less of the same size as the main bedroom, and it contained what looks like a sofa bed. There was also a kitchen equipped with oven and hob and a pantry room. The apartment has its own bathroom, which had a window, although I suggest that you keep that window closed unless you want to give a show to the other residents using the lift). Each room has at least one window overlooking the narrow streets. There are two air-conditioning units which are both controlled within the apartment. Another important factor is that we found the apartment very clean.\n\nThe breakfast:-\nEvery morning we were presented with a selection of sweets and delicacies (no fried eggs, no bacon, no sausages, no toast) such as nutella, briosh, chocolate cakes, cassatella siciliana, small non oily pizzas, apple tarts. We just went to the display and picked from the selection. As regards to the coffee and tea, these were made at the bar. My kids were treated specially, as every day Danilo who is the manager of the residence used to come to our table and give my children a kinder sorpresa each. Now this is something that I never experienced in 3 or higher star hotels. The kind gesture of Danilo was appreciated by both my children and myself.\n\nThis was my first time in Trapani and obviously my first experience staying at La Mattanza. With the service received, value for money, warm friendliness and welcoming environment, I will have one less headache of having to choose where to stay when planning my next visit to Trapani. La Mattanza will be my natural choice where I will be staying again.\n\nA final message to Danilo, Martzia, Mary: Keep up the good level of service and standards. I wish you luck and more satisfied customers. Looking forward to see you again!","32128":"Could not fault this apartment. It was spotless, spacious and very comfortable. Location was perfect - near train and bus stations and short walk into the main town and port. The host Antonio was very welcoming and helpful and we loved his little dog Lola who was also very friendly!\nWe stayed for a week in Trapani and also visited Erice and Favignana.\nWould strongly recommend this accommodation :blush:","32162":"We had a room on the roof with a huge patio. Price was right, loved the touches like water and juice in the fridge on arrival, little cakes, and breakfast at a bar just down the road.\n\nNothing I can really fault about this place. Location is on the edge of the centre of town but nothing is more than a 10-15 walk away. Plus easy access to the ast local bus to San Vito lo capo or the airport. We will definitely return to trapan and plan to stay here again.","32173":"This hotel is in an ideal location, right by everything you need! There is free parking off-site by the Coast Guard which is walking distance from the hotel. The location is right by the happening area of Trapani...literally 2 or 3 blocks from it. Hotel was clean and basic...perfect for a quick stay!\nTrapani is the hub to get to the Islands, be sure to book your ferry ticket in advance FYI...","32179":"Aldo and his father, Gaspare, were very accommodating and helpful. They directed us to free parking nearby.\n\nThe room was clean and offered a charming view. The property is close to the port, shopping, dining, and major attractions in the city. There is an elevator to reach upper floors.","32180":"We stayed 4 nights in Delle Botteghelle (early May 2018) and enjoyed our stay very much. The location in the historic centre is ideal for visiting the various places of interest in the town and within easy walking distance of various bus stops for visiting Erice and Segesta.\n\nOur room (302) was modern and spacious and the bathroom was well equipped and roomy. Breakfast was good with the usual selection of breads, cakes, cereals, cheese, cold meats, and fruits. Giuseppe the manager was very helpful in recommending places to visit and how to reach them. We would not think of staying anywhere else in Trapani in the future.","32183":"Had a great stay. I was met late at night upon arriving in less than five minutes. The room was comfortable and the desk clerk was super helpful and kind. The location is fantastic! Staying solo was great and I felt safe. Great restaurants nearby!","32185":"We just came here for a night to spend near Trapani hotel. We have forgot to inform stuff about our late visit here and they were very kind to wait us until we come late at 2:00 AM. We do had a very pleasant stay here. The room was modern and corfortable. Everything here were very tidy and clean! We also tried breakfast on 4th floor. They were also very tasty. After we checked out we did notice that our car were taken by city service, so the reception guy have helped for us a lot to find it and get there by taxi. Thank you!","32186":"We so enjoyed our stay in this very well run establishment in Trapani. It was very comfortable, and the staff were so helpful and friendly, which always makes for a very pleasant experience. The location was excellent. Very handy to the port, long distance bus stops etc, and easy walking distance to shops, restaurants, and other attractions. Price was reasonable for the standard, and we can thoroughly recommend.","32187":"We have just returned home from a lovely holiday in Trapani, Aldo and Papa cannot help you enough, They arranged trips for us with our own driver Frank, The hotel is central as many have mentioned and beautiful, The rooms are cleaned daily it was truly an excellent stay, We will definitely be back to Trapani and definitely back to Residence Porta delle Botteghelle, Thank you All for a truly Amazing Stay .","32192":"Stayed in Porta delle Botteghelle following my friend's advise and wish to state that I was satisfied with the location, service, cleanliness and hospitality.\nOn our arrival we were greeted by Sig. Aldo presumably the owner of this residence, who was very friendly and polite and made us welcome.\nHe also suggested some good restaurants which we visited and we were really satisfied.\nThe location is perfect, very close to the main shopping and dining establishments and very close to the port and main bus station.\nRooms are clean and service is great.\nI recommend this residence and surely will be my choice again on my next visit.","32223":"This is a great hotel! The location is perfect and easy to get around in Trapani. There is free parking within 3 blocks of the hotel and the hosts were very helpful with this. The room was great with a very nice bathroom. We were on the 4th floor and there was an elevator as well as stairs to get to the room. The breakfast was very good, especially the pistachio, almond and mandarin orange spreads for the breads. Aldo and his father were both very helpful with recommendations. They helped us to take the funivia to Erice. We were so glad we did not drive up. They also helped us to take the ferry to Favignana. We enjoyed our stay at this B&B and in Trapani that we extended for a third night. Because of the season they were able to easily accommodate us. So glad we decided to stay at this B&B. One of the best of our trip in Sicily!","32238":"Beautiful accommodation, within 10-15 mins walk of the town centre. Accommodation offers the best value for money, everything is clean and tidy. The B&B consist of 4 rooms on the third level (elevator available), our room was recently renovated, spacious and bright, the bed comfortable with modern private bathroom and hairdryer, air conditioner work well. The four rooms open up to a common area with fridge, table, chairs and sofa. The area is equipped with kettle, cups and tea bags. Free Wifi performed very well.\nMineral water is offered by the owner Cristian, a small touch that is very appreciated.\nCristian was a fantastic host (I have to say probably one of the best I have come across) providing detailed information not only for the accommodation but travel tips on what to see and do in Trapani and the surrounding areas. There is free street parking in the surrounding streets but you must be aware of the restricted days and times for street cleaning.","32249":"Usually we stay at the same hotel as previously did, this time we booked at Sale e Sabbia B&B. We were all satisfied with the rooms and very clean. Highly recommended with a very warm welcome from the Manager.\nRegards Ray","32296":"We stayed at Donatella\u2019s Apartment for a few days. It is in a really great position to discover Trapani. Unfortunately the description and photos on the site are misleading and wifi was very unreliable. One couple had to sleep in a room with no privacy as the others had to walk through to get to the kitchen. It may be suitable for a family with children but not couples travelling together","32335":"Close to everything (port, old town, beaches) this apartment was a very good deal. It was well equipped, clean, well decorated... overall it was a lovely place.\n\nMaria Antonetta, the host, was incredible: she helped us with our reservation problem with hostelworld.com, gave us very good tips and places to go to and was very friendly.\n\nHighly recommended!","32343":"My girlfriend and I spent 5 days in September 2012 at San Pietro Casa Vacanze. We really had an amazing trip and I can really recommend it to anyone else.\nThe accomodation is very generous, clean and is positioned perfektly in the center of Trapani's old town. The house is very nice and as soon as you enter the inner side, you are amazed by the look of an old palace. As I already mentioned the rooms were very clean and generous. Above all our polite renter gave us a lot of very valuable \"insider tips\" which helped us to have the perfect stay at lovely Trapani! This helped us to \"feel home\" from the very beginning and we perfectly could enjoy our trip.","32369":"What is important to us, on holiday, is staying somewhere that is clean, in a location that is convenient and where we are made to feel welcome. Secret B and B delivered all of these things and much more: a big bathroom with a wonderful shower, comfortable bed, delicious breakfast with a wide choice and very kind people. An enormous thank to Lory and her team for making us so welcome.","32370":"A rehabbed old building, with a very nice B&B inside. You will have to park (if you drove) over in the Piazza Vittori Emanuele, but that is a short walk. If you have a small car you can get to within a block to haul your luggage. (we drove a Fiat 500, and glad it wasn't larger.) The stairs are an adventure, but there is an elevator. comfy room, huge bathroom, good breakfast, and well-located.","32371":"This B&B is located in the midst of a jumble of narrow streets (lanes?) and is somewhat hard to find. Google maps failed me at the end.\nIt is situated in a renovated old building. That brings a lot of character to the place. On the other hand, it faces significant structural challenges, most importantly narrow hallways as well as high and uneven steps. Elevator does not stop at some floor levels, thus requiring climbing up or stepping down those steps (including carrying one's luggage).\nThe staff is friendly and the wifi is good. Breakfast is also quite good.\nContrary to booking description, there is no on-site or near-site free parking although paid parking can be found nearby. Bringing luggage to the property must be a factor in considering booking this B&B. Moreover, this property does not accept credit cards -- cash only.","32383":"Trapani is beautiful town with many places of interest around. Secret B&B Hotel is on a walking distance from everithing what must to be visited in Trapani. Regards to the owner Loredana for the hospitality.","32384":"Secret, yes, with no phone took a while to find this place, then the issue of finding a parking spot raised its head again, but there is a public parking (Payable) spot about 500 metres away.\nOnce inside its a little Eden. Very well done up, chique! The room had everything that I needed, albeit quite small and the single baed was a little narrow.\nReally central, great for seeing Trapani on foot, and the ladies running the place were both lovely and friendly.\nHighly recommended and great value for money!","32386":"The girls who have this B&B are very friendly and welcoming, they provide lots of information regarding restaurants etc. Their English is excellent. The room are great, and the building is very neat. Coffee and tea is always available. Breakfast is very good, yogurt, fruit, etc with your choice of scrambled eggs or omelets.","32387":"A really lovely and well restored building in the historic centre of the city. Access is via an alleyway which seems dodgy but isn't, otherwise had a perfectly nice stay here - the staff were really lovely.","32389":"This is a lovely B&B, very well designed inside with great rooms, modern but keeping some old touches. The access up the stairs is very steep, but don't worry there's a lift, the quietest in the world but also the slowest!!!!\n\nThis place is real value for money and close to the old town. Parking is also easy in public metered parking close by\n\nWell worth a visit\nPs the best water pressure in Sicily here!!!!","32401":"The B&B is hidden off a main street, but the hotel will send a e-mail with exact directions making it easy to find and well worth the effort. The rooms are clean, the bathrooms modern and the prices are a real bargain. The standard breakfast is good, but if you like omelets, ask for an omelet, you won't be disappointed. This gem is a bargain.","32402":"This is a gem of a hotel with beautiful touches in a very old, traditional Sicilian building. Staff are lovely. Location is an easy walk to shops and restaurants.\n\nWe loved drinking wine on the roof top each night!","32404":"We stayed 2 nights in this amazing b&b. It is well located in the centre of Trapani and it\u2019s very easy to walk everywhere from there. Even if there isn\u2019t a car park exclusively for it, there\u2019s a few very close by and not too expensive and we manage to find a space without too much trouble.\n\nThe bedroom itself was very clean, of a good size and very quiet. It\u2019s not easy to climb the stairs but worth it! It could be good to have a light in or next to the shower but that\u2019s the only thing to make it even better.\n\nAbout the breakfast, it was good and we really appreciated to have eggs and bacon but it would have been better if more fresh ( fresh juice, fresh bread, croissant).\n\nThe staff was very friendly and helpful.\n\nOverall it was a very nice stay and we would definitely come back if we come again to Trapani.","32407":"Secret B and B is a well-run B&B which is located in a good position in Trapani to reach the boats to the Egadi Islands, a short walk to the pedonale area of town and close to parking where you can leave your car over night.\nThe management is helpful and good. Breakfast is fine and everything is certainly adequate for a good stay in Trapani.\nThe problems I encountered which needed improvement were, first and foremost, the bed. It was basically a cot with springs I could feel. I mentioned it to the owner but she was reluctant to admit that the mattress needed improvement and rather stated that I needed time to adjust to the time and environment. I slept well in Palermo and had already adjusted by the time we reached Trapani. The bed was poor. Period. The room was also extremely small just the size of the bed. I'm used to small rooms as I lived in Europe for 10 years but this was extremely small and bordered on uncomfortable. The room was beautiful and the hotel is also beautiful from a design perspective. I hate to quibble about room size since the price was fair, but, it might be of a concern to some. The only other issue I had was a clogged shower drain. I didn't mention it since we were only there for two nights and I'm sure it would have been fixed but you might encounter little things like this if you stay here. My biggest concern was the mattress. It was the worst we had on our entire 15 day stay in Sicily.\nAll in all, however, this is a \"very good\" B and B. One can always find better but if you stay here, I feel my review is fair and accurate.","32412":"Booked this after reading good reviews !!!!!!!!\n\nArrived after sat nav sent us round in a million circles. It is located within a labyrinth of small roads. Many are no entry or too narrow for a car. We had to abandon and walk there\n\nInitial impressions were of a dirty street. We buzzed to go in. The building looked very clean inside\n\nStairs are steep made of stone and slippy. There is a lift but to get to our room you had to come out. Go up 2 steps and then down 3 steps with your cases\n\nThe room was quite small. The door hit the bed so you could not fully open it and the same on the other side to the small balcony that overlooks the dirty street\n\nA very small refrigerator that no bottles could stand up in and which switched off when you left the room so nothing stayed cold\n\nThe bathroom was very narrow and the toilet very high !! The shower leaked and did not drain away properly so you ended up paddling in dirty water.\n\nBreakfast was ok but everything had been measured out. Tiny pieces of cheese and slices of meat cut in half !!\n\nTrapani itself is awful !!! Dirty and scruffy and we couldn\u2019t wait to leave. At least we only had 2 nights there.\n\nWe suggest anyone who stays here parks on Corsa Italia crosses over, turns right at the chemist and right at the picture of the Penis. The accommodation is then a few yards away as the road bears left.\n\nIt costs 50 cents an hour up to 8pm. It\u2019s then free till 8am\n\nThere is another Carpark across town that is free that they recommend. However it\u2019s intimidating as people point to spaces. Come up to you and ask for money they are wearing blue bags !! When I asked the woman in question for a ticket she rummages and handed me a scruffy one. I then asked where the police station was. She went off in a torrent of Italian and it was obvious they are beggars. She hung around the car when we walked away. Not trusting her we went back moved it and she carried on her rant\n\nThe last night we got back to our room after eating and we found a massive cockroach there. We caught it and disposed of it. This obviously is due to the rubbish in the streets\n\nThe staff are friendly\n\nNever again would I visit Trapani and we have visited Sicily many times","32413":"My husband booked for us to stay here for one night whilst we were travelling around Sicily. Situated in the middle of Trapani\u2019s small streets this is a little diamond of a place! Don\u2019t be fooled by the outside because the inside is stunning! Renovated to an extremely high standard keeping its old charm, the room are amazing, all very modern and completely kitted out. Welcome chocolates on arrival and very helpful and friendly owners. Free (workable) WiFi and a small roof terrace and the breakfasts were the best we had in Sicily during our time there! Highly recommend!","32414":"I chose Secret B&B for my two nights' stay at Trapani for its location. Five minutes walk to the railway and bus terminals, as well as to the Old Town. In April, the price was a fraction of those in the Old Town or near the port. After booking, the B&B provided detailed information on how to get there.\n\nThere were ten rooms on three floors. Newly renovated with modern furnishing. The entry hallway had two large arches, giving a hint of the building's past.\n\nA tiny elevator took me to the top third floor, where I met hostess Lori. She showed me two rooms to choose from, one with a private terrace and one without. I chose the former :-) The room was spacious with a comfortable bed, and the bathroom was well equipped. Both were spotlessly clean. Very good wifi speed. The bed was made, and the towels were changed everyday. The large joining terrace was perfect for lounging in the sun.\n\nThe breakfast had great selections, including cakes baked by another hostess Francesca. As I was about to start on my full plate, Lori asked me if I would like scrambled eggs with bacon. How could I refuse? She then went into the kitchen to cook it.\n\nLori and Francesca spoke good English. They made me feel welcome, and were eager to help with information. This was the best B&B I stayed at during my three week trip.","32439":"Terrace Villanova is an excellent choice in Trapani. The owners are very sweet, helpful, the rooms clean and large, the breakfast first class. Both walk an extra mile to help you in every issue. we were four of us, two couples, and had an excellent time, they are stairs but Vitor will help you carrying your luggage, very easy to park and only a 10-15 minutes to walk downtown. Thanks, Saul, Carla Gianna and Roberto.","32506":"I am surprised by some of the negative comments. Star ratings are based on room size and Tiziano had wonderful rooms as it is a newly built (not city center) hotel. Yes you are a walk to the old city but nothing wrong with the neighborhoods you are walking through. Those reviewers are imposing US stereotypes on Italy with its small narrow softly lit city streets flanked with its multi-story buildings. If worried about the neighborhoods either walk down the harbor front with its normal offerings of eateries and then cut up to the old town or if you have a car drive down the waterfront with its ample parking or drive to the large parking area adjacent to the old town. Walking is a must as cars are forbidden in the city center itself. The hotel was clean (even the telltale runners on the elevator doors), well maintained, with ample on-site parking (Italian style) and a very friendly accommodating staff. The breakfast buffet was well above average but not exceptional and the coffee well made. Because of its location it is only a short drive from the autostrada and offers immediate access to the route to Marsala.","32510":"Pros-The hotel is situated in a good location, however it is NOT a 4 star as stated.\nCons- Lorena at the front desk was not helpful. We asked her to make a reservation for us at one of 3 different ones we had chosen from Rick Steve\u2019s guide book. She said our first choice was closed until the following Monday and the other 2 \u201cwere no good\u201d. She did quickly recommend another restaurant and made reservations for us. We were the ONLY two patrons in that restaurant from 7:30pm until 9pm...on Friday night! This should\u2019ve been a red flag. The food was awful, small portions and overpriced.\nWhile walking home, we found our first choice of restaurant was indeed open, And it\u2019s so popular, there was a line to get in! ! I think she got payment kickback for sending hotel customers to the restaurant she suggested, or the owner is a friend etc.\nWhen we checked out,she was not able to get the printer to work and wanted us to write down our credit card info so she could launch it later\u201d. We refused and when we asked for a written copy of the bill she suddenly got the printer to work again.\nParking is atrocious . Patrons park anywhere and everywhere, blocking each other in.\nMediocre breakfast, nothing special.","32513":"This hotel is situated around 15 minutes walking time from the city center but belive me, you don't really like walking there. The area surrounding the hotel is extremly dirty, deserted and after sunset you simply wouldn't like beeing outside. Not a single shop nor a restaurant is near the hotel so better call a taxi for transferring into the center but don't do it at the reception because they will call some \"friends\" who will rip you off for the short drive.\n\nThe hotel itself has small rooms with a 198o's interiour the breakfast is a disaster (not only that there is not much on offer but whatever is gone is gone, without explicitly asking for it it will not be replaced) the service from check in to check out is slow, rude and unambitious. Although the hotel was half empty my room was never made up before 3pm and at check out we had to pay a huge late-check out fee for checking out at 1pm!\n\nOn the positive side the hotel had sound proof windows and so made it to the second point in my rating.","32541":"This is a modern hotel and has private parking. The room appears clean but when looking deeper into the floor or bathroom tiles, sink and shower one can tell that it is not really clean. You wouldn t walk bare foot on the floor definitely!! Worst thing though- the breakfast!! Omg!!! No choice and nothing fresh. Forget the english breakfast with bacon and beans. Only sandwich which was disgusting and no fruit from where to choose. They had cereal, and cake and cappuccino.","32544":"My wife and I, plus my wife's sister and her husband traveled to western Sicily. We stayed four nights at the Tiziano Hotel. We day tripped from there. The reception staff was great, always answering many questions and giving us directions to the sites we wanted to see in the region. We also visited distant cousins in Montelepre. The rooms were large the bed very comfortable. The bathroom was exceptionally large. Housekeeping was very friendly and accommodating. Breakfast was included and the coffee was brewed to order. Nice lounge area, very short walk to the \"downtown\" restaurant area. We have travelled in Europe many times. The Tiziano rises close to the top of our list for a moderately priced hotel.","32604":"+ really nice and helpful owner\n+ car park in front of the place\n+ big, well equipped room\n+ shared kitchen\n\n- no window in the room on the groundfloor (really dark)\n- no ventilation in the bathroom\n- a little too noisy from other rooms (depends on how other guests behave)","32617":"We are impressed by the place , we stayed with a group of 20 people. Beside nice accommodation and comfy rooms, Daniela, running this place is such a helpful person. Besides, full of perfect ideas! WE stayed just for 3 days and thanks to her, had an opportunity to organize so many different facilities.","32685":"We stayed in several hotels and B&Bs during our stay in Sicily, and Armando, Doina, Antonio, and Delfina were the best hosts we had. They went above and beyond to ensure that we had a great stay. We even ran into Armando and Doina in Trapani when we were returning from Favignana, and he spontaneously took us to see the Mysteries of Trapani tucked away inside a church - which was really cool because I don't know if we would have known anything about it, had he not brought us there!\n\nUpon arrival, we were greeted with some blood orange juice and local specialty cookies, and Armando showed us some points of interest in a book that we got to keep (as a gift). I'm a big planner, so I asked him a few questions about what to do and logistics, and he was really great at giving useful advice about what to do and when.\n\nThe location is great - far enough from the town where you feel like you're really away, but close enough to drive into Trapani or to Erice for dinner easily. We used this as a base for visiting Selinunte, Marsala, Trapani, Favignana, Erice, and San Vito Lo Capo. Parking is really easy and there's enough space to ensure no panic attacks when you're pulling in (unlike a lot of other places we visited!). You'll need a car if you want to stay here - it's too far to walk from town, and I'm not sure about the availability of taxis. Your car will be safe, as it's a safe and quiet area and it's also a gated property.\n\nPro tip: the outside gate is green and there's a sign for the property on the gate. I say this because we didn't go far enough when we arrived the first time, and there's a gated community a few hundred meters from this villa that has a long palm-lined avenue that looks very similar. The GPS directions may not bring you directly to the gate, so keep a lookout. Bonus points: the villa has a circle driveway in front so you can easily pull in to open the gate from either direction, which was a godsend.\n\nBreakfast was served al fresco (in nice weather) and was delicious, with fresh figs from the garden, homemade cake, homemade caponata, bruschetta, fruit, yogurt, hard-boiled eggs, and a selection of meats, cheeses, and other items. The coffee was lovely and plentiful, and I'm now addicted to blood orange juice.\n\nThe view from the property is fabulous - you can see Erice and look down at vineyards, etc. The pool was great, too, but we only got to go in it once (the weather was a little too rainy most mornings, when we had time to take a dip). There's a huge terrace that wraps around the whole villa, with plenty of space to relax outside if you like.\n\nThe air conditioner worked really well in our room and the bathroom was well-appointed with yummy-smelling products. The bed was nice and big and the extra pillows were super comfy. They left us a huge bottle of water (complimentary) for our stay, which was really nice to have.\n\nBecause it was the rainy season, they provided us with an in-room bug zapper, which was super helpful to keep any mosquitoes that snuck into our room (because of the heavy rain) at bay.\n\nIt really was a wonderful stay and an excellent value for the money - I would absolutely stay here again in a heartbeat!","32693":"We spend 2great nights at this agriturismo b&b. Lovely place ,one of the best breakfast we ever have.Loads of thinks to see around. I want to say thanks to the owners for the great time we spend. Definitely coming back","32695":"Words will not do justice to any description of this property. This was one of the best stays we have experienced to date and leaving was difficult.\nThe property is in the countryside, a few Km's from Trapani. The owners are welcoming, extremely friendly and helpful. The house has three well appointed, air conditioned guest rooms. Wi Fi is excellent and the quietness of the place even better. Breakfast is excellent, with a selection of cold meats, jams, cakes, fruit and even a home made bruschetta.\nI would not hesitate recommending this property and look forward to returning there again.","32701":"Great place to stay to visit Marsala-Erice region. Treated like family here by our hosts Antonio, Delfina, Armando and Doina. Peaceful, quiet, comfortable room. Cannot ask for more. Many sites to visit nearby. Tante grazie","32711":"We stayed here for two nights and everything was just great. It was almost like when you come home after a long time :) Owners are very nice and helpful. Delfina wellcomed us on the stairs in front of the reception, and then showed us our room. Room was big enough and clean, with a huge terace, full of beautiful flowers and a view on a historic town Erice. They also gave us a botle of wine and water. As we were there out od season, we were the only guests, but the service was perfect. Breakfest which was included in price was very good. They prepared eggs, some tipical bread with olive oil, tomatos and tuna, salami, cheese, yoghurt, olives, oranges, coffee, tea,...and more and more. Deflinas husband gave us a book of Trapani and explaned what we need to see in this area. He even draw us a map of this places and it was realy helpful. It was a pleasure to stay here. If (when) we come back to Trapani, we'll come back :) Thank you for everything.","32713":"Unfortunately, we were under the impression that this place was a hotel and not a bed and breakfast. Antonio & Delfina are exceedingly nice and do try very hard to sort out problems with he room etc. Antonio is a larger than life character, akin to a benevolent Basil Fawlty, that will cheer your day up with his stories of the Far East, where he spent 44 years. Delfina is adorable with her deep laugh and bright eyes that light up the day. Michaela, who prepares breakfast, is exceedingly nice and efficient. Breakfast is taken in a covered part of the back garden. The rooms are well appointed, but one in particular had a strong smell of sewage that apparently is a problem across Sicily. Antonio, after two days of struggling with the problem decided to move us to another room which was much more acceptable and bigger too. We initially had a fridge in the room but that broke down and the ever resourceful Delfina allowed us to keep stuff in a fridge next to the breakfast room. The supply of hot water varies, to the extent that one day we only had cold water, for which we were admonished by Antonio for not calling him to fix the problem. By this stage, we just could not face making any more complaints. There is also a splash pool, which we did not use.\nWe found that the cost of staying at this B&B was too steep for what was on offer. The B&B has no laundry, restaurant or snack facilities (no vending machine) with the nearest restaurant in Trapani that has a serious parking problem. There is a small caf\u00e9 down the road from the Villa but that only serves sandwiches, ice creams and snacks.\nThe trouble with this place is that it is neither fish nor fowl. It's priced in the range of a a good 4 star hotel but does not offer the services of a hotel. The home baked pastries and cakes, as well as the fruit picked from their garden, and the home made jam are all good but in our judgment do not justify the price paid. Is this another unintended effect of Brexit and the 30% devaluation against the euro?","32731":"Great place to stay, few minutes away from Trapani and wonderful location. Only 15 to a wonderful beach area. Antonio and Delfina were very wonderful and welcoming. I recommend this location anytime u cone to trapani. Also plenty of space for parking and relaxing","32780":"Stayed for just one night, and it was just okay. Gave two stars for a few reasons. Firstly when the manager showed me to the room he took one of the towels away because I was staying on my own which seems mean to me. Secondly, there was what seemed like an incontinence sheet on the bed. Thirdly the TV did not work well, the volume kept going up and down for no reason. The location was not great as there was only a bar and pizza shop open at 7.30 (obviously I was staying in low season but I don't feel the price reflected this....I paid 35 Euros). Left early in the morning so did not eat breakfast and went to Trapani to eat so cannot comment on the restaurant. Only minutes drive from the airport though which is why I choose it in the first place. From my experience I would not rate it higher than a two star.","32786":"We chose this hotel for the night we arrived in Sicily - it has parking and is close to the airport. The staff were welcoming and the room was comfortable if somewhat dowdy. Well worth considering if your flight is not due to land until fairly latre in the day.","32789":"We chose this B&B to be close to the airport for an early morning flight. We were pleasantly surprised by its lovely courtyard and garden, nicely appointed large room and bath (great water pressure in a good-sized shower). We had an excellent dinner at the adjoining restaurant. We left too early in the morning for breakfast, but the proprietor arranged our taxi which was prompt and got us safely to the airport, less than 3 miles away. We would have liked to have stayed longer to enjoy the B&B and see the sights around Trapani.","32791":"Stayed here for one night with friends (total group of 4).\nWe booked this hotel since we knew we would be arriving late at Trapano airport, so it was very convenient to spend the night there and start our tour of Sicily from there.\nClean, comfortable, good value for money. Not recommended to stay for more than one night.","32840":"Location: the apartment is very conveniently located - in 3 minutes walk you can get to the port, from where you can go practically anywhere.\n\nRooms: very modern, bright and clean. Fresh towels, sheets etc.\n\nStaff: very helpful and available\n\nBreakfast: we were provided with breakfast from two different cafes- both were excellent\n\nI would highly recommend this residence to anyone visiting Trapani. If you are carrying loads of luggage please note that there is no lift and that may be a downside. It is however great value for money & highly recommendable.","32855":"Zibibbo Suites was in a perfect location in the old time. Parking was near by and very easy to maneuver. Laura, the proprietor, was fabulous. Our room was extremely spacious and the ac worked very well. The room was clean and we had fresh towels and a daily housekeeper. The rate was very affordable... almost unbelievable. This is where I will stay again if I have the opportunity to return to Trapani.","32871":"The owner Laura and location were 10\/10 the old town is the perfect place to stay. We stayed here for 5 nights as a base for a family of 4 . The washing machine in the 2 bedroom apartment came in handy for our 3 week vacation. The apartment was spotless large and very comfortable with 2 large bathrooms.\nWe were given wonderful advice by Laura on where to eat and what to see and do around Trapani . The only downside was the weather was wet so we didn\u2019t get to enjoy the beautiful roof top space.\nOh and the restaurant downstairs does a lovely light breakfast with daily baked fresh homemade cakes. Overall everything is at your doorstep and thank you Laura for all your help and being so accomodating.","32875":"We spent a week here and Laura was kind enough to give us an upgrade to a larger apartment rather than just a double room.\nGreat location, a 2 minute walk to main street in Trapani old town or to the sea walls. Was a small shop close by so we could stock up on essentials to keep on the kitchenette. The fridge was quite cold and one left over pizza froze!\nVery tidy and well kept, cleaned daily. Plenty of wardrobe space for clothes and a drying rack which was handy for a day it rained and beach trips.\nBreakfast was typical Sicilian with baked goods and cold meats. We had scrambled eggs (had to ask) a few times which was a welcome change.","32881":"We loved our stay here. Prime location if you like to be close to all the bars and restaurants. The rooms are lovely and clean and the beds were very comfortable, lovely air-conditioning. On arrival we were warmly greeted and given lots of suggestions of what to do. Where to park our car etc. (there is a fee car park about 10min walk away). You can drop off your bags and then go park. The accommodation is in the old narrow part of the town, hence the lack of parking. We did a boat trip to the near by islands through Zibibbo, which was just lovely. We had fantastic local food for lunch and a few extra treats. We were leaving the same day and the owner of Zibibbo kindly dropped us and our bags to our car after the boat trip. 10 out of 10 for service.","32886":"The location is great, the room is clean and comfortable. one block to the sea. The staff is very helpful. We are very well informed with the hotel details and the place worth taking a look in the city, as well as the good food and special ice cream and dessert. The staff even helped us to order traditional food via phone call when we sitting in the restaurant and having no idea with the Italia menu. The hotel gives us the feeling of a friendly comfortable safe home in a strange city.

We recommend the place to people who use the kitchen to make themselves a cup of coffee. We used it to make pasta for dinner (Going out for dinner isn\u2018t very relaxing with two little kids.) and didn\u2018t feel very cosy. The rooms are rather dark so we recommend it as a place to sleep and not to spend time during the day. Laura does everything to make you feel at home though. Laura c\u2018\u00e8! Thank you, Laura!","32892":"two nights at Easter. Very clean and perfect to watch the procession passing under the windows. Some difficulties parking but given the time there is. New structure geographically perfect. very helpfull and kind staff \u2764","32968":"We experienced Minareto shortly after its post-Covid reopening. As a result, only a portion of the accommodations were occupied. We loved having the magnificent beach almost all to ourselves (except for the publicly accessible area adjacent to the resort beach), and we were pampered through and through by the super friendly staff. Minareto\u2019s superbe location on the tip of a promontory across the Isle of Ortigia and its luxurious setting make it a destination of choice for any visitor to Siracusa, and we will be happy to return even when things are back to normal.","32977":"We were booked into this hotel on a group tour for 2 nights and wish we had been given an extra night to fully enjoy all it had to offer.\nBeautifully located across the bay looking at Ortigia, we were lucky to be allocated a sea view room, which was a very happy surprise. The rooms are fairly compact and for our taste, gaudily decorated. The bathroom was a good size and a big walk in shower, a good hairdryer (hurrah!), and very good quality toiletries.\nOn our second night, we noticed staff setting up what looked like the reception for a wedding party in the common area outside our room (which overlooked the bay). We thought the wedding \u2018do\u2019 would go on late and did enquire about it but were assured it would finish before 9pm (it did), and to our surprise, the management sent us a bottle of Prosecco \u2013 that was a very nice touch.\nWe really only got time to have one swim and the big pool which was great.\nWe found breakfast to be absolutely fine with lots of choice and on our last night the group enjoyed a good if unspectacular meal, very pleasantly served.\nWe found all the staff to be absolutely charming and very helpful. As we say, we would have loved an extra day at this very smart hotel, but sadly time didn\u2019t allow it.","32979":"We booked a week at the Minareto from 6th October. There are two really positive things about the hotel - the stunning views of the bay to Ortigia and the staff who are mostly helpful.\n\nHowever, the negatives outweigh the positives as far as we are concerned. The weather was really stormy on our second night and the rain came in the front door and patio doors. I got up to find the floor flooded. We had to move the furniture and our possessions about to stop any damage. We reported it to reception and some cleaners arrived. They mopped it up and left towels on the floor which we had to put up with until the weather improved. There was no word of apology from a manager or anyone asking if our possessions had sustained any damage.\n\nThe hotel is some distance away from local restaurants so unless you wish to drive into Syracuse there are one or two adequate places to eat, but after experiencing the breakfast we were very glad we did not pay to have dinner at the hotel. The cooked breakfast options were very limited (bacon, frankfurter and congealed scrambled egg) and they were never hot. There was a cook offering fried eggs or omelette to order but it was either undercooked or burned.\n\nMy final complaint is with the overcharging for a bottle of wine which we only found out about when we paid the bill when we left. On our first night we asked the porter if we could buy a bottle of white wine to take to our room when we arrived after midnight. He drove us to our room on a golf buggy and got a bottle of wine and 2 glasses. When we opened the wine it was a fizzy rose. I was concerned what we may be charged for the (wrong) wine but we assumed it would be \u20ac30 maximum. The bill showed a cost of \u20ac45. I asked to speak to the manger. I also pointed out that the wine was rose and not on the room service list. The manager refused to see us but the receptionist offered us a \u20ac10 discount.\n\nMy overriding memory - anger and feeling that either the driver or hotel had overcharged us for a very average bottle of wine.\n\nWe would recommend going elsewhere - either to stay or have breakfast. It was not value for money at all compared with the last hotel we stayed in in Sicily. We would not recommend it.","32980":"The hotel is in a wonderful situation with a view looking directly at Ortigia and its ancient fortifications. We had a very good room with a balcony overlooking the sea. Room service was excellent. Breakfast buffet style and with good choice and all excellent other than the coffee - which is unusual for Italy. Restaurant food good as far as hotel food goes (which is never great - but OK and service good) and we ate in three times. Poolside restaurant for lunch excellent - light and just what was needed. Do not understand the comment saying there was no food! Staff particularly helpful and cheerful. Absolutely no need for a car (contrary to what other person said) - a shuttle bus in and out of Syracuse and taxis ad lib. Water taxi to go out in the evening to dinner best way to go - look at the sunset and get taxi back. Car would be needed if you wanted to travel around. The best hotel swimming pool I have ever used and not many people. Only minus comment would be that it is not luxury rather it is a good 5 star - and there is a difference - but we will go again.","32982":"We thought the hotel was underwhelming. It was rated as a 5 star deluxe hotel. Service levels really need work. No food or bar service at the beaches. Later in our stay, I was told that the lifeguard would look after you. He made no effort. Requested ice to our room which never arrived. we had a sea side room....walls were paper thin as you could hear conversations in the room beside us. The shuttle service into Syracusa was excellent. Rooms were very well looked after. We felt the food in the restaurant was overpriced for what you received. The dining service was very good","32984":"Fantastic hotel. Great rooms, reasonably large and well decorated, good bathroom (only fair showers - could be better). Right on cliff facing sea. Fantastic, fantastic views of sea and Siracusa. Beautiful.\n\nMultiply areas to swim and lie down.\n\nGreat service (breakfast bag day of departure). Excellent breakfast buffet. A+","32985":"We spent 3 nights at this hotel as part of a tour of Sicily. The setting is stunning! Overlooking a bay and across towards the ancient town of Ortiga, a room with a sea view is a must! A veranda with table etc so we could eat out in the evening was fantastic and staff very friendly and helpful. Food (while not cheap) was excellent and certainly recommended.\n\nSo, why not 5 star rating? Well, it's the little things that matter when spending this sort of money for a stay. Things like chipped plaster on the bathroom walls, some tired looking decoration and fairly dark bedrooms don't quite make it a 5 star rating for me. And being mobbed by wasps around the pool every time you had a drink or maybe something to eat was tiresome! Not something that happened at the other two hotels we stayed at on our tour.","32987":"Really enjoyed our stay at Minareto. We had booked with TUI and it included transfers to and from the airport, which was very useful as it is about 45 minute drive. The hotel is certainly impressive, the view from the grounds and the two different 'beaches' are first class. They are well looked after and were spotlessly clean, in fact the lifeguard was even clearing the beach from seaweed that was blown onto the beach after a storm.\nWe had booked 1 week for Bed and Breakfast, which was a good choice as the service at Breakfast is exceptional, the manageress Gabriella is so good she even remembered what type of coffee we enjoyed !\nOn our first evening we ate in the restaurant and unfortunately the food was only average, So from that point onwards we used to walk (about 15 minutes) to the marina, there were several restaurants and they were excellent L'Asteria Blu and La Fornace stand out.\nWe would certainly like to go back and would thoroughly recommend the hotel. We found all of the staff extremely helpful and hope that Gabriella is put in charge of the restaurant for evening as well as Breakfast !!!","32989":"After reading the reviews on this hotel I wondered if I had made a mistake in booking a 14 night stay, with premium sea view and half board with my wife through tui.\n\nThankfully we thoroughly enjoyed our holiday at this hotel but there are many irregularities especially in the restaurant when a wedding is in progress, and there were at least four whilst we were there. It would seem the same staff are required to serve both weeding and holiday guests which ultimately results in hotel guests receiving a poor service.\n\nThe bedrooms are dark - very dark, Not sure we would book half board again, whilst we would eat in the hotel it was more expensive for half board, if it had a diamond against the menu selection it required an extra 15 euro's on top of the 50 euro's already paid, which makes it expensive, the meals are of sufficient size not to need three courses, therefore eat at the hotel at a more reasonable price and enjoy the quality of the food, although be patient.\n\nWhere I completely disagree with previous reviews is the quality of the food, the food is generally very good, both at breakfast which is controlled by a very caring manageress and whilst the evening meal is good the service varies enormously and I can understand peoples frustration in waiting long periods to be served.\n\nOverall this is a good hotel and certainly worth a visit to enjoy the many facilities it has to offer, which includes an excellent swimming pool","32996":"I made a reservation on May 31st for July 9th to 11th. On July 6th, while traveling in Malta, I got an email from the hotel: \u201dIt is really sad for us to inform you that we are not able to accommodate you in our hotel.\u201d When I asked why, answer was: \"The security procedures have not been totally completed.\" Personally I'm not sure which is worse, either cancelling the reservation with very short notice or admitting that they have failed security procedures which hundreds of other hotels in Sicily have accomplished.","32997":"I didn't book this hotel but was sent here when the Antico Roma decided they were undergoing renovations and couldn't honour our booking. But it was a blessing because this beautiful, well-conducted hotel was a perfect retreat; in the old town near the water, superb breakfast and helpful, efficient staff. We would have preferred a sea-view to a blank air well since Syracuse is famed for its location and I need fresh air, but the sea view rooms were unavailable.","32998":"We loved our stay here in the old part of Siracusa, called Ortigia. This boutique hotel sits in a line of 14th century buildings overlooking the Ionian Sea. The inside has modern conveniences while preserving the charm of a Renaissance building.\n\nBreakfast was a large buffet of local cheeses, fruit, yogurt, breads, pastries and cereals. With great coffee.\n\nThe staff couldn\u2019t be any friendlier or efficient. We especially want to give a shout-out to Ruggero and Miranda (?) who went above and beyond their usual desk duties to help us with finding places, calling the airlines and making reservations. All of the restaurants recommended were excellent.\n\nOur room faced the sea. It wasn\u2019t huge but roomy enough, with high ceilings and floor-to-ceiling windows that opened to a demi-balcony. One of the more comfy beds we had in Sicily. The shower had great pressure and instant hot water.\n\nComplementary wine, water, coffee and fresh juice is offered every day, all day. After a long day of touring the town, it was relaxing to sit in the bar lounge with a glass of vino.\n\nEverything is within a 5 to 10 minute walk on Ortigia. Our hotel wound up being very quiet at night, since it was a few blocks from the bars and restaurants.","32999":"My partner and I absolutely loved this hotel. The service was outstanding, highlighted by the free welcome bottle of wine, free non-alcoholic beverages in the minibar, and our reasonably-priced upgrade to a Deluxe Spa room (definitely worth it!). The location is amazing - the entire island of Ortigia is an easy walk any time of day or night and you have great views of the Mediterranean (there is a road between the hotel & the water but it was not a distraction at all). The room was quiet. The breakfast buffet was good. Nits: the bed was a bit on the firm side, but we both still got good night's sleep (and beds are personal preference so ymmv). Also, our wi-fi was a bit spotty, but it was good enough for moderate use. But neither of those were major concerns, this place is still a 5. We'd definitely stay here again.","33000":"Two days wasn't enough. Charming doesn't even describe how superb the hotel is. Staff was extremely friendly, breakfasts were delicious and plentiful, location was near the water and close to everything. Stuffing one's own cannoli at breakfast was a real treat; I wish I had taken some home in my suitcase.","33001":"Great stay (with excellent wifi) in this lovely quirky hotel facing the sea in eastern Ortigia. The staff are the great strength of this place which is just a very short walk to the centre of town but absolutely peaceful at night. We had a lovely room with a huge terrace overlooking the sea - a junior suite - with a lovely clean bathroom and great shower.\nThis is an ideal place to stay for discovering the south eastern area of Sicily.","33004":"The hotel is located in an old palace on the sea front with superb style and decor. The room was a pleasure to be in; great attention to every detail. The staff was extremely nice. The breakfast was one of the best we ever had: very genuine local products, such as cannoli, ricotta cake, orange and lemon jam like we never tasted before.","33009":"Our visit to Syracuse was one of our anticipated locations in our tour of Sicily, and our choice of Algila was the icing on the cake. From the very first greeting of the reception staff to our fond farewell, our stay was exquisite. Everyone was helpful and courteous. Our lack of Italian was not a problem, since everyone was fluent in English. This was our first visit to a Charme Hotel, but I have decided that I will use them in any European city I can. Very professional yet warm, often a difficult balance, was everyone\u2019s demeanor.","33012":"I stayed here for my wedding with my friends and family. We also got ready in the hotel the day of the wedding. The hotel is beautiful, in an excellent location and the staff was knowledgeable and helpful. Everyone had an amazing stay, and I am so happy we chose this hotel out of the many amazing places to stay in Ortigia. The breakfast was beautiful and one of the things we looked forward to every day! We splurged and got the room with the large jacuzzi on the roof...it was absolutely incredible watching the sunrise from that roof and made for a totally unforgettable experience. Two thumbs way up!","33014":"I would like to thank the staff att the hotel for making our stay perfect. We celebrated our 20th anniversary and were upgraded to a beautiful room with a terrace overlooking the ocean.\nLocation is excellent in relation to everything you want see in Ortigia, sights, restaurants etc.\nThe breakfast was good. Not too much and not little to chose from.\nThanks again to the staff:thumbsup:????:thumbsup:????:thumbsup:????","33015":"Ask for a room with a terrace. This place is a jewel. Lovely full breakfasts made to order. Helpful front desk. Near everything anyone would want to see. Evening turn down service. Very close to parking. No cars allowed in Old City.","33019":"This is a perfect hotel in a perfect location in Siracusa. The setting is lovely and it is a 5 minute walk to anywhere in Ortigia. The staff is welcoming and helpful. There are two buildings - we were in the one not attached to the lobby - but it makes no difference. Breakfast was OK - you can order off the menu if you\u2019d like - and the staff is very friendly.","33020":"The room was one of the nicest during our 3 weeks in Italy. The front desk staff was very efficient and helped us get reservations at very nice restaurants that were usually hard to get into.\n\nThey were very clear about how to find them by car and helped us manage the issues of ZTL (pedestrian only streets).","33021":"We had a beautiful room at the top of the stairs. Very clean room and comfortable bed. Wonderful breakfast especially for my gluten free husband.\nGreat location to all the attractions. Can walk everywhere. Staff is wonderful and helpful.\nHighly recommend.","33022":"This hotel is perfectly and centrally located on the waterfront in Ortigia. The staff was very welcoming and helpful with restaurant suggestions. It has a nice charm inside, although not so beautiful from outside. I would highly recommend this hotel.","33023":"It's hard to fault this delightful boutique hotel. The location is at the edge of Ortigia island, which is walking distance to every charming nook and cranny of Syracusa's old town. Our room was extremely spacious with soundproof windows, a renovated bathroom (which could use a little more shelf-space for cosmetics and toiletries), a very generous breakfast which includes a fresh and regional buffet and any items off of the menu. The staff are incredibly eager to go the extra mile with suggestions, tips and recommendations to make your stay as wonderful as it could be. Even the local beach club (Lido) is a mere 200 feet away.","33024":"Spent four nights at this hotel and we were extremely pleased. The location is on the water, but only a few minutes walk to the middle of town and the Duomo plaza. You are away from the crowds.\n\nYou are also just a five minute walk to the Market which is open every day at 7:30 am and has an incredible selection of fresh fruits,vegetables and other great things.\n\nThe hotel staff is excellent and the rooms are large and interestingly decorated. The breakfast is extensive and well prepared.\n\nWould certainly recommend this hotel to friends and family.","33025":"There are two buildings separated by a narrow street. Our room was in the \u201cnew building\u201d, but both properties are nicely renovated old buildings retaining many original features. The rooms vary in size, so check you\u2019re getting a good sized one. The bathroom ran the whole width of the room and was really great with a large walk in shower and a bath. Only a few rooms have much of a view. Air confirmed. Free WiFi and free international calls! Breakfast was excellent, buffet and a la Carte included.\nA delight.","33026":"I liked this hotel a lot. The room was charming although ours had no view. Our room was very clean with plenty of room and all the right touches. Staff was lovely and very helpful. Great breakfast buffet. They even had free single speed bikes that you could use to explore all of Syracuse. The hotel was across the street from the Ionian Sea and within easy walking distance of everything in Ortigia. Parking in Ortigia is tough, so the valet parking service they offer was a big help.","33027":"Hotel was beautifully situated and I had a corner room overlooking the sea but the AC was so ineffective that I had to keep the shades and curtains closed to help keep the room cool. I paid so much extra for a hotel and its view that was not looked upon. Staff were helpful and the breakfast was adequate.","33028":"We stayed here in August while on our first trip through Sicily. This hotel is great! The staff was ever so helpful. Especially Enzo. The food was great. Our room had a water view and was very comfortable and clean. It is a little tricky to find if you are driving, but worth the trouble.","33029":"The hotel is nice, not saying it isn't. If it had been a little bit cheaper, I'd probably be giving rave reviews. But for the money (and as compared to other hotels where we stayed in Sicily), my expectations had been raised. Yes, the hotel is facing the water. But it is also facing the parking lot, and if you have a lower-floor room (as we did), you're basically looking at the parking lot (and need to stay wary of those who could see in as well). I was also disappointed that the breakfast had no view either; it was in a stodgy crowded room in the back of the hotel. Our room was \"okay\" and with an \"okay\" shower, but again, a bit disappointing overall, given the price. If we were staying longer, I might have even asked to change rooms. The staff at reception were very nice. Overall, we absolutely loved loved loved Ortigia\/Siricusa -- was one of our favorite towns in all of Sicily. My guess is that there just aren't a lot of great hotel choices in the area? We spent (a lot) less in other (boutique) hotels throughout Sicily, and we had nicer rooms and lovelier rooftop breakfasts.","33030":"My father wanted to take me on a vacation for my 50th birthday. We chose Sicily. I chose Algila & I was so pleased with the service, atmosphere, location. The staff are very helpful, friendly (not too much) & accommodating. The breakfast, restaurant & bar were delightful. A nice wine list of Sicilian wines. The rooms are quiet & very nicely decorated. The location in Ortigia is great. A few blocks from the market, view of the sea from the front door, easy access for cars & by foot.","33031":"Our original reservation was for three nights. But we enjoyed Ortigia so much that we extended our stay for an additional three nights. The hotel was very accommodating. The staff was first class. We are planning to return next summer.","33032":"This hotel absolutely lives up to it\u2019s name. It\u2019s thoroughly charming, from the understated elegance of its interior design to the seamless service.\n\nWe had an ocean-facing double room which, although small (we had to step over a chair to access the window), was very comfortable.\n\nEach morning we were treated to a magnificent sunrise over the ocean from our deliciously comfortable bed!\n\nThe hotel is located right in Ortigia, putting all of the city\u2019s rich historic precinct with easy reach. We spent our days exploring the labyrinthian streets and seeking out quaint restaurants.\n\nQuite often, there was no need for lunch, having enjoyed one of the most sumptuous breakfast offerings imaginable!\n\nThe English-speaking staff are also super helpful. After our bathroom roof sprung a leak, a team of people was on hand within minutes to sort the issue.\n\nHighly recommended.","33035":"My husband and I stayed at Algila Ortigia Charme Hotel for six nights in August. The hotel was charming, comfortable and clean. The location was perfect, our room was spacious, and we had a view of the waterfront.\nI can\u2019t say enough about the hotel staff. They were friendly and helpful. The front desk people went out of their way to make sure our visit was enjoyable, from restaurant and sightseeing recommendations to loaning towels and a shade umbrella for our day at the beach.\nBreakfasts were delicious with many choices and the service was exceptional. Their servers work very hard to make sure you are taken care of and have a pleasant start to your day.\nI would recommend Ortigia Charme Hotel to my friends and hope to return.","33037":"We moved to this hotel after being unhappy with our first reservation. I really can't recommend it highly enough. The reception was very warm and helpful. A deluxe top floor corner room with a balcony was available and we snatched it up. It was beautifully decorated with antiques, tile floors, well and subtly lit at night, and bright during the day thanks to all the windows and French doors. The bathroom had a bidet (extra points for that!), an ample sink with Bulgari amenities, and a large shower with steam. The bed had some kind of fantastic mattress with super lux ironed damask sheets and even a cashmere blanket! We had two balconies, one with a hot tub, shaded table and chairs and lounge chairs, the other with a table and chairs. Breakfast was an ample buffet including homemade breads, fruits, do-it-yourself cannoli and pastries, yogurt, freshly squeezed orange juice, with the option of made-to-order eggs and every kind of coffee and tea available. The location was right on the waterfront and a very easy walk to all the treasures of Ortigia. Our room and the whole hotel was extremely well maintained with every little detail well thought out. Really a marvelous stay. We will be back!!!","33043":"We enjoyed a 4 night stay - had a double with balcony overlooking the sea and our teenagers shared a junior suite - similar price for more space without the view - both rooms were super comfortable. It's a beautifully designed hotel in great location on the seafront. All aspects of our stay were excellent but the thing that really stood out for me as exceptional were the staff at the hotel who were all super efficient and really helpful. We used the hotel taxi service for airport pickups and a day out at the nearby beach club who were also great We particularly enjoyed a visit to the amazing archeological park in Ortiga.","33044":"Recently stayed for only two nights at Algila Hotel and absolutely loved it. We had a family room which was two connecting rooms through a hall way entrance which was perfect.\nThe rooms seemed brand new but still had a beautiful classic taste, better than most five star hotels we\u2019ve stayed in around Europe.\nLovely helpful staff at reception to assist you with any needs.\nThe bathroom tiles to the roof- everything has been done so tastefully. Lovely bathroom amenities, beautiful comfortable beds and even a free mini bar with drinks!\nCute little balcony with a sea view to the side and quiet during the night.\nBreakfast was beautiful with everything you\u2019d want, fresh orange juice served, eggs the way you like and a fresh buffet with fruits, muesli etc.\nUnfortunately no pool or beach club access from hotel however we discovered a fun beach club perfect for ocean swimming about 2-3 minute walk to the right of the property. Be sure to pre-book beds as they book out early morning.\nThank you again and we will be recommending your lovely hotel to everyone!","33046":"We had a lovely room overlooking the sea. Plenty of room, comfortable bed, nice bathroom. The breakfast was very nice, in a real restaurant. There were the normal things out to choose from, but you could also order off the menu. I\u2019d go there again, happily.","33047":"I work for a hotel company so I am a bit picky when it comes to choosing a hotel. I was very happy with my choice of Algila Ortigia Charme Hotel. I love the location, the room was very comfortable, clean and the bathroom had the right amenities. You will not go wrong with this hotel, the staff was friendly and helpful. The breakfast is good with a variety of items! You can walk around Ortigia easily from the hotel, around the hotel there are wonderful places to eat as well. Excellent overall!","33050":"Photos do not do this very special hotel justice. We were lucky enough to book the family room and couldn't believe our eyes when we walked in. Two exceptionally spacious rooms with beautiful bathrooms, high ceilings, stocked refrigerators connected through a perfect hallway that allowed both for privacy and the comfort of togetherness for our younger kids. It was fabulous. The location is lovely in perfect Ortigia, which in and of itself is such a gem. The staff offered many great restaurant recommendations and could not have been more accommodating. The breakfast was excellent - you would be hard pressed to find a person who wasn't delighted by the myriad of offerings. The hotel also has a spacious seating area to relax with water, some juice and little bowls of snacks during the day, which made for a nice area to relax with our kids in the hot afternoons.\n\nA couple of teeny tiny quibbles: the tvs were so small they were unusable (wouldn't care normally but we were there during the world cup and the ball was a mere pinprick) and had very few stations, the shower floor was so incredibly slippery that my son took a nasty spill (I almost did as well, so it wasn't kid horsing around) and the parking is more expensive than it should be. The air in one of the rooms ran very cold and refused to adjust, but in a 105 degree heatwave, that was certainly preferable to the alternative. One final quibble - they use some sort of a pod machine for the coffee, which in addition to being environmentally questionable when used on a large scale, it also makes pretty low grade coffee. We'd come to enjoy our morning freshly ground lattes elsewhere, so again, though a minor quibble, I think they should switch to a standard machine to step it up just a notch.\n\nWe would enthusiastically recommend this hotel to all. It's a real find.","33051":"We stayed at the Algila Ortigia Charme Hotel for three nights in June. We had a beautiful room in the newer portion of the hotel across the street. The room was of adequate size with an amazing bathroom and shower. We would love to have that shower at our home! We had a large balcony with a hot tub on the the roof of our room. It was a bit of a climb to the hot tub on the roof, so we kept the wine consumption to a moderate amount while climbing the steps. The view from above was gorgeous. Marcello had to carry our heavy bags(felt sorry for him) and always with a huge smile. The kindest staff ever!! The breakfasts were excellent, when we could get out of our comfortable bed in time. This is a beautiful island and the hotel was one we would come back to in a heartbeat. Grazie mille Marcello!!","33052":"This hotel fills two renovated buildings and they are beautiful, elegant and historic. We just arrived with our two daughters and I had to review so as to not miss a detail. We are in an adjoining room and we love the lay out. Our teenage girls have their own space and we have ours. The bathrooms are large and well appointed with Bulgari products. The rooms are furnished with period pieces which all are part of the story of this renovation and all with a modern flair. Everyone is so accommodating and lovely. The front desk arranged for a car today to take us to nearby Noto, Modica and Ragussa and the price was right. Way way better than taking a train or a bus which you could but in the end it all adds up and not personal. It's also in the mid 90's so air conditioned car and drop off is key. They also have arranged our airport transfer for a very reasonable fee. Over all we are super impressed and would not hesitate to return or recommend. Also this location is unbeatable for walking or going to the beach which the hotel is happy to provide whatever you need. We booked early and very glad we did, we are very happy with this hotel, it's a beautiful building, well done! As for views and all the other comments, ask and you shall receive. We're happy with our view of the rooftops, it's what I expect. It's all part of the charm and the once upon a time of this place.\nThe breakfast was way more than we needed, well done! And the cold refreshments provided in the minibar hit the spot after a long hot day of walking. This hotel has more complimentary details to offer than some of the 5 star high end small luxury hotels of the world chain. We are overly impressed and grateful to not be nickel and dimed. Superb!!!!","33053":"I spent five nights at this hotel, and couldn't have been happier with my choice. I had a room with a balcony looking onto the harbor, a good choice if you like to have fresh air in the room. The room itself was very comfortable, with a phone permitting free telephone calls to the USA as well as reliable wifi. A bottle of fresh water every day, very nice toiletries in the bathroom, and a staff that is friendly and willing to help in every way, without ever being intrusive. The restaurant is superb, too, and very comfortable for a solo traveler. I loved Siracusa and will hope to return again and to stay again in this lovely hotel.","33055":"Our experience of the hotel started positively with the staff who were very pleasant and helpful throughout our stay.\n\nWe had a large corner room with a sea view and it was really lovely. It was clean and comfortable and just perfect for our stay.\n\nThe bathroom was a good size and the luxury toiletries were a welcome touch.\n\nBreakfast was very, very good with a wide selection and great coffee.\n\nWe enjoyed and made use of the free wine in the late afternoon.\n\nWe hope to return to Sicily and this hotel.","33056":"From the moment we entered ,we knew this stay was going to be memorable for all the right reasons. The reception staff are so welcoming as are all the staff. Our room was fabulous and the breakfasts were a real treat. All sorts of fruit and a selection of hot dishes made individually and quickly. The location is superb and we fell in love with the old town. Don't miss the street market for the brilliant atmosphere and small gifts to take home. The fish stalls are works of art in themselves. There are loads of good restaurants within easy walking distance of the hotel and everyone is so friendly. I highly recommend this hotel and it was one of the highlights of our holiday in Sicily. Thank you everyone at the Algila Ortigia Charme. ( Room 365.)","33060":"We stayed 2 wonderful nights at Algila Charme Hotel. We booked a room that had a terrace with a table and on a second level had a jacuzzi with views of the sea and Ortigia. The room was very nice and the staff and food at the hotel could not have been any better. We highly recommend staying here if you\u2019re in Ortigia.","33061":"This is a really lovely hotel, beautifully decorated and in a great location, perfect for exploring the streets of Ortigia. We had a wonderful room overlooking the sea and the staff were so friendly and helpful. We had a fantastic week!","33062":"Loved loved this hotel. Walking distance to everything. Beautiful rooms and the service was amazing. Breakfast was the best we found in Ortigia. Highly recommend. Rooms have been redone beautifully. Free mini bar. No alcohol but all drinks free. Our kids loved it!","33064":"A impressive hotel in a great location for exploring Ortigia. The hotel itself is spotless. We stayed in the renovated \"new\" section of the hotel and its was beautiful - our rooms were five star quality. Check in was easy, but I would recommend the valet parking service, as parking generally can be tricky. Travelling with two small children, we generally have to eat relatively early (which can be difficult in a place where a lot of the decent restaurants don't open until 7.30pm at the earliest). Despite this, the hotel put a call into a local restaurant that opened 90 minutes early just for us - you can't beat that for customer service. Very good breakfast layout, with attentive staff. Easy check-out. Overall, very impressive.","33065":"It was our first time to stay at Algila Ortigia Charme Hotel.\nIt is in a fantastic location near the sea.\nOur room(a suite)was spacious,well furnished and we had a beautiful bathroom.\nEverything was very clean!\nThe staff was \"first class\",polite,extremely friendly,helpful.....\nBreakfast was delicious!!!!\nThank you all(and Marcello);you were great!\nWe will return!","33067":"The Algila Ortigia Charme Hotel is a beautiful 5 star hotel in a fantastic location just across from the seawall on the Isle of Ortigia. The rooms are large and beautifully furnished and the bathrooms luxurious! The amenities, free international calling, free minibar and the free breakfast were all nice touches. Each and every one of the staff members were polite and extremely helpful during our stay. We will definitely return to the Algila Ortigia Charme Hotel in the future and would highly recommend it to anyone visiting this cute charming little area outside of Siracusa!!","33069":"This is an excellent overall hotel. The location on the sea (not bay) side of Ortigia is perfect. The rooms have a clean, uncluttered appearance without being \u201cstark modern.\u201d The staff are quite helpful. Breakfast has a good selection and you can order an omelette without extra charge.","33072":"We stayed for five nights in October. Very good location to walk to all sites in Ortigia. We booked two rooms. Both nice. One with a large terrace and hot tub. Breakfast was good but not spectacular. I am very pleased with our choice.","33074":"The place is implacable . Well organized and very clean. We were a family group of 5 adults and 1 child. They did their best to accommodate us to rooms suitable for us all. And the owner Giusy, went out of her way to make sure we are happy and satisfied with the rooms we had. The breakfast was out of this world. All tables decorated with divine food . We used to look forward to it first thing in the morning . Everything homemade with a lot of passion. Dinner was served on terrace with specials of the day. The grounds and pool area were well organized and well kept. All the staff went that extra mile to make our stay as enjoyable as possible . They all took pride in what they do . Well done to all. We definitely visit again .","33076":"We stayed At Borgo Pantano hotel with another couple and it was The most amazing place I have visited! Friendly staff ( Giusy, The owner , is fantastic) always making\nyou feel At home ! Breakfast is top: savoury and sweet dishes , freSh fruit and local produce ( homemade cakes). The pool is amazing, and The huge wirlpool is so relaxing.\nThe Rooms are spacious and cosy and above all they are quiet . There is a nice restaurant in The terrance which is so romantic in The evening . I have been here twice and I shall certainly return!\nI truly recommend it!","33082":"This was one of the most wonderful resorts I've stayed at in my life. What a terrific get-away. Be advised that it is not near anything, and you would need a car to go anywhere. But if you want a peaceful time in a lovely country unfussy place, with superb staff and food to die for....this is it! The rooms are not gigantic nor are they fancy, but our room (number 116) had a very good shower--better than all in Sicily and with better pressure, the best towels we had encountered in all of Sicily, many good products, large desk, fridge, lots of hangars, very good wifi and a lovely netted bed. The grounds were ultra charming, with a large pool, couches to recline on etc. Check the photos. The only drawback is that the bathroom lighting was a bit dim and I don't believe the dining room is accessible, unless I missed something. The breakfast is EXTRAORDINARY. I will attach photos. It was a buffet like I have never seen before, presided over by the warm, friendly, talented Lucia. I called her \"Saint\" Lucia. You will never again have a breakfast like this. It was a work of art. I believe she and her crew start baking at 4am. I would come to this hotel just for the breakfast. We also had an amazing dinner there, pasta with eggplant, zucchini parmesan, potato croquettes, sea bass, vegetables and semi-freddo--all very imaginatively presented by a fantastic staff. Someone is doing something right!!!!!","33083":"Sicily offers many surprises including this lovely resort hotel open from late March through mid November. Each room is dedicated to an Italian poet and provides all the amenities of a modern resort in a Villa setting. The grounds are gorgeous with beautiful flowers and trees, a huge pool with a beach entrance on one side, and covered ramadas and hammocks surround this beautiful area. Hot tub and spa services are also available. The exquisite meals provided on site were unmatched as was the service! A car is required as it is located outside the city but the drive is worth it!","33084":"From pulling into the hotel compound until departing, this establishment went out of its way to ensure a wonderful experience. I was part of a group, and the tour operator booked us into this hotel.\n\nThe grounds are heavenly with a resort pool and a heated pool, both surrounded by well tended gardens. The rooms are of various sizes. I was in a single in essentially a separate building reached by going outside from another building. The room was small but comfy. It was well appointed with a very nice bathroom (which had a stall shower). The amenities provided, along with the towels, were top-notch.\n\nBreakfast was an extravaganza, with the chef on hand (and having her cookbook available). It was a truly amazing assortment, with the pastries being outstanding and different each day.\n\nWe had dinner at the hotel as well. It also was very well prepared.\n\nThe rooms have wifi and safes. Small reusable carry bags are provided, which are perfect for going to the pool. I did not try the spa while there.\n\nThis is a resort and a place that I would go again to relax. Plus, it is not too far to Syracusa and everything that town offers.\n\nIt should be noted is that the dining room is on the second floor of the main building and only apparently accessed via outdoor stairs. The hotel did provide umbrellas when rain was in the forecast.","33085":"I would like to thank all the staff for making our stay an experience that we will all never forget.\n\nI have personally never met staff so dedicated, attentive and polite. Thank you, you are adorable.\n\nThe hotel, no words could really describe this amazing place. The gardens are absolutley beautiful. The rooms are spotless.\n\nLucia, you are a darling. Believe me, this woman can bake. The breakfast....wow!!!! The attention to detail is outstanding. Well done to all the staff.\n\nOne again thank you and keep up the EXCELLENT work.\n\nTHE LARGE GROUP FROM MALTA","33087":"Lovely resort to get away from it all. Not anywhere near town \u2013 you have to take a shuttle to get there\u2014but if you don\u2019t mind a commute and just want to relax, this is great. Food is wonderful, especially the lavish buffet breakfast with all sorts of custom made things\u2014don\u2019t miss the chocolate cannoli. Rooms are very quiet with great soundproofing\u2014our room faced a major walkway but still didn\u2019t hear people walking by at night. Great shades to keep the rooms dark at night. Two nice pools, one of which is fairly warm with Jacuzzi jets. Good spa with inexpensive massages. Exceptionally helpful staff.\n\nA few minuses: Wi-Fi was OK but not great\u2014a bit erratic. In our room, the bathroom door opened in, blocking the toilet.","33088":"This hotel is exceptional in all dimensions: our room was spacious and well decorated , the breakfast the best we have seen - and we are traveling a lot.\n\nThe garden and the pool are so beautiful, we had to promise our kids to come again. What we do with pleasure..\n\nAnything negative? For the hotel you need a car as it is in the middle of nowhere, but this in not unusual in Italy for great places.\nWe will come again !","33090":"Upon arrival...we took in the fabulous landscaping on the grounds. We were graciously welcomed and took advantage of the bar in the lobby with a delicious and refreshing Aperol Spritz that nestled onto a lace doily, along side a lovely bouquet of hand-blown glass flowers.So pretty. Rustic Modern Vibe. Greeted by Almo who gave us his whats app info to contact him anytime, with a thorough list of things to do and offerings. No detail missed. We had 2 other families with us, totaling 10 people and this was the perfect pick for all of us.\n\nWe entered our rooms and even our kids squealed with delight. Modern, Clean and lovely.\n\nEveryday was filled with the most extensive and elaborate breakfast I have ever seen that far surpassed any 5 start Ritz Carlton or Four Seasons. It was the essence of thoughtfulness, detail and variety !!! Pretty over the top and displayed lovingly. All of our friends declared, \u201cit was the epic breakfast not to be missed.\u201d I think we all still dream about it. We had several dinners and those too were delicious\u2026with fabulous paired wines.\n\nThe hotel has so much for the kids to do\u2026on site ping pong and fabulous care to take care of your kids nearly almost all day with a short couple hour break. Pretty amazing.\n\nThe grounds and landscaping was my favorite part. So stunning. There are pools for all ages.\n\nThe staff is brilliant, helpful and so fun to talk to.\n\nHonestly, it has taken me months later to write this review because I wanted to do it justice. Not sure I have been able to express\nHow wonderful this place is. I\u2019d actually like to live here.\n\nI have posted some of my photos and drawings of this hotel on my Instagram account, as pictures help to tell the better story.\nInstagram\/studiomorgan\n\nThis place is a win. We definitely will return.","33091":"We spent eight days here in October and used Borgo Pantano as a perfect base to explore as far as Taormina and Villa Romana Casale. All the staff are delightful and speak multiple languages, but graciously allowed us to practice our limited Italian. A special thanks to Olmo for his welcome and practical tips, and for helping us out when our flight home was cancelled and we needed to rearrange our car hire. We also appreciated the comfortable suite, the wonderful pool and the delicious breakfasts. We have never been to Sicily before, but are already looking forward to our next trip.","33092":"We spent 5 nights at Borgo Pantano.\nWe'll never forget how great it has been.\nThe whole team has been more than helpful. Seeing people with such big smiles from early breakfast (and what a breakfast!!!) until late dinner makes us want to stay in this little paradise forever.\nA very special \"thank you\/grazzie\/merci\" to Olmo. Whatever you need, Olmo's always here to help. Restaurants, vinoteca, gelateria, places to park your car in the city, places to visit, he knows them all. And even when he was off he took care of us, our special needs and our reservations in Syracusa. I felt bad about it but that's what he meant by \"I'm here to help you. Thanks again Olmo.\nA special Grazzie mille to Marzia too. She was an angel with our son, who was looking for her as soon as he woke up everyday.\n\nFoe sure we'll be back.","33094":"A 45 minute drive from the airport and we arrived at Borgo Pantano in time for lunch. The reviews didn\u2019t do it justice - a perfect place for a short Autumn stay - lovely gardens, fantastic pool, only a short drive from some great places to visit. A high point was the help we received from Olmo who met us as we arrived at reception and helped us familiarise ourselves with the area. The best places to find parking in Ortigia, great places to eat and beautiful beaches. All his recommendation paid off and made our stay all the more enjoyable.\n\nAlso first class was the breakfast - all home cooked and a fantastic variety - fresh fruit, savoury snacks and tempting pastries - we had them all...most days!\n\nFinally a big thank you to all the staff at reception and in the restaurant who started our morning with welcoming smiles and a friendly Bongiorno!\n\nThe surrounding area of Siracusa is beautiful and we feel we have only just scratched the surface. We will be back!","33095":"My family and I stayed at Borgo Pantano at the end of September 2019 and from the moment we arrived we knew we would have a special time. The wonderful Olmo, the main man, the go-to-man, the man who will go the extra mile gave us a wonderful introduction to the hotel and great ideas on what to do with our 2 boys whilst staying in the region.\n\nOur boys (6 and 3 1\/2) had a wonderful time here in the expansive grounds and excellent pool\/s.\n\nWe had a two bedroom and master en-suite which was very comfortable for all of us.\nThe pools are fantastic, the very large pool offered great areas for all ages, even a very shallow areas for young children, the second pool\/spa is of great size and nice and warm. There is a playground which is good for kids under 4.\n\nWe were very impressed with the nanny service, which we didn\u2019t know existed, Marzia was brilliant, cooking, creating and playing with the kids, which gave us some down time by the pool or time to enjoy a massage.\n\nThe breakfast is the most amazing place to indulge in a variety of cuisines. It\u2019s not just croissants. A large breakfast for all taste buds, this was another huge win for us.\n\nWe highly recommend this hotel\/bnb to families, couples or groups, approx 10min drive to Ortigia. Olmo, Alberto, Marzia, and co made this stay extra special and will welcome you with open arms as well.\n\nThank you.","33096":"A lovely welcome from Olmo began our stay, a warm check-in experience. Plenty of car parking (& you will need a car unless on a bus tour) - hotel has clear signage on the roads in thank goodness!\nExpansive grounds beautifully kept, 2 pools (one large and unheated, the other small and 30'), loads of seating options eg. lounges, hammocks and rugs on the lawn.\nWonderful breakfast (see other reviews!) & we dined in a couple of times for dinner which was very good and much easier than driving into town, and reasonably priced.\nOur room was modern and clean. If there was any downside, it would have to be that the bed was quite firm (ok for some & seemingly typical for Sicily? ) and twice there was no hot water, only lukewarm, no big deal. It did get a bit noisy sometimes as it's a kid friendly hotel.\nThanks to Mrs Guisi and Olmo, we really enjoyed our stay.","33098":"When we arrived at the beautifull domain we immediately were friendly welcomed by Olmo. You can count on him for any questions, advice and problems. He's a bit like your personal assistant :) The room we had was spacious, but could have been a little more cosy with some small details. The breakfast was stunning. A large buffet with 3 tables full of goodness. local specialities, eggs, bread, pastry, fruit, you name it, you'll find it, and Giusi, the hotel owner, is always there interact with all the guests. She also made a nice document with thing to do and is always prepared to answer your questions. The pool area is very nice. There a a lot of cosy places to sit or lay down. Even thought there are 40 rooms, you will always find a quiet place to relax.","33099":"This is a jewel in warm and friendly Sicilian hospitality!\nIf it\u2019s the team at the check-in counter, the people at the pool-side restaurant, the gardeners, the more-than-helpful owner-boss-missus :sunglasses: - and culminating with the most adorable breakfast-mamas: you\u2018re being spoiled and treated in the best relaxing way!\nA little off the frenzy of Ferragosto-packed downtown, it\u2018s a peaceful retreat, or starting point for excursions along the south coast, alternatively.\nOh, btw: six stars for the breakfast!","33100":"So we did a two week road trip around Sicily. Our agenda had us only staying at Borgo Pantano for one night. All I gotta say is that was a big mistake on our part. This hotel had everything we could want in a hotel and in retrospect I wish we could have stayed here at least 2-3 nights and just done day trips out of here. By far our favorite hotel of all of the places we stayed. Why do you ask?\n1)Staff was incredible! With our check in Olmo not only told us about the hotel but gave us great recommendations for how to navigate Syracuse quickly with parking\/buses\/restaurants\/etc and stayed in communication on WhatsApp. You can tell that this is a family run hotel. Everyone here really cares about their guests and wants them to enjoy their experience.\n2) Parking- Super easy. If you are on a road trip, the last thing you want to do at the end of a day of sightseeing\/driving is get stuck in a busy city driving down one way streets wondering if your car is going to get trapped. No worries with this at Borgo Pantano!\n3) Breakfast- Just when I thought I couldn't eat anymore, we went to the Borgo Pantano breakfast. it's an incredible spread with lots of homemade treats. Still salivating about some of their sweets especially. Also our favorite breakfast of all of the places we visited. The staff at breakfast was also super attentive and helpful!\n4) Pool- It's awesome. It was warm in Sicily and being able to cool off at a gorgeous pool as the sun was setting with a spritz is what vacation in Sicily should be about\n5) Rooms- spacious, clean ,comfortable beds, nice showers and good products. Rooms are quiet because you are out in the country. The whole place is enclosed by a fence to it's also pretty safe.\n\nIf you need a home base in this region of Italy, Borgo Pantano is perfect. Can't recommend it enough.","33101":"What a lovely place to stay. The rooms and bath are very good, but what makes this place special is the staff, especially in the breakfast room. We were there and they found that it was my husband's birthday. The staff donned funny hats and glasses and sang to him while presenting a small cake with a candle. They were very genuine and really wanted to please us as well as all the other guests. We had a group dinner on the rooftop which was very good and, again, with great service.","33102":"Wow. What a fantastic experience. After 3 nights in Noto, this was a brilliant way to finish our week in Sicily. The staff are superb. All of them were helpful and friendly and quite faultless. I wish I could name them all, but I must mention Olmo and Lucia.\nThe grounds and the pools are magnificent. So much choice and variety, and so spread out that you couldn't fail to find some peace and quiet somewhere. There's a poolside bar and restaurant that serves excellent food and drink during the day. There's a lovely rooftop terrace for breakfast and evening meals. I've never seen such a choice of food for breakfast! Evening meals are very good too. Plenty of parking for those with hire cars. Good taxi service in and out of Syracusa and Ortigia.\nWe did however have a room that had the bedroom in the loft space, via stairs. I just mention this for people with mobility issues. I think there are only a couple of rooms like this. We will be going back there some day.....sadly not tomorrow!","33104":"During our mid-Sept. 2019, three-night stay at Hotel Borgo Pantano my wife, adult son and I were most impressed with the friendliness and can-do attitude of the entire staff, including the owner Giusi, the assistant GM Olmo, the pastry chef Lucia and the various other employees (front desk staff, bar tenders at the pool bar, and waiters and waitresses at the hotel restaurant), whose names I can't recall. When I asked the front desk if by chance they had swim goggles I could borrow, a pair was found. When I asked for a scale to weigh myself after three weeks of consuming massive amounts of pasta and pizza in Italy, they didn't have one initially but they delivered one to my room the next day even though I assured them there was no need to do so. Olmo was prompt and helpful in responding to our questions about local sites to visit and made us reservations at solid restaurants. At our first breakfast I mentioned to Lucia that I liked pistachio desserts and at breakfast the following morning she pulled me aside to note a particular pistachio-laden pastry she had baked for that breakfast.\n\nAs excellent a hotel as Borgo Pantano is, no place is perfect and thus I point out two areas for improvement. The gym, which sits in a shack behind the pool bar, is spare: a single tread mill, a bench, and a few bar bells and a handful of plates but no dumbbells. Given the hotel's excellence in other areas, I expected more from the gym. Also, we found mosquitoes to be a problem on the grounds--lots of bites after sitting out at the pool and outside our room. I saw a staff member doing some spraying one morning: a potential solution, but one that can create its own problems if not done safely.","33105":"Visited hotel Borgo Pantano to have a relaxing getaway. The hotel completely exceeded our expectations, on arrival the lovely Olmo sat down with us and recommended all the best food spots in Siracusa ranging from pizza to granite and all the best seafood. We tried every one of his recommendations which he readily booked for us to save us hassle and we adored every meal, the whole experience had such a personal touch! The hotel itself is so tranquil it feels like you're escaping from reality. All of the staff were so friendly and helpful and made our experience unforgettable. The breakfast was one of the best I've had anywhere in the world, the rooms were fabulous. The only downfall was that we wished we booked to stay longer. We will be back!","33106":"This is a superb hotel in the countryside about 10 minutes drive away from Siracusa. The staff are second to none. Olmo, the concierge gave us some great tips for restaurants in Ortigia and was very knowledgeable, friendly and accessible throughout our stay. Lucia and her team in the restaurant were second to none. The breakfasts were amazing with a huge selection of vegetarian options and they made special breakfasts for our daughter who is vegan, nothing is too much trouble. Dinner too was beautifully presented with vegetarian options which they adapted to make vegan. The owner, Giusi mingled with the hotel guests every morning, chatting and generally being lovely. All the rooms are individually designed with modern stylish interiors, the gardens and pool beautifully manicured. Overall it would be very difficult to find fault with this gem of a hotel.","33107":"This is a true oasis. The grounds and pool are in perfect condition, very well kept. Rooms are fine if not large and have the expected amenities and are clean. The buffet breakfast is amazing, every sort of pastry, protein, breads, fruit you could ask for and then some. Plus the servers are extremely helpful and friendly. It is clear they take the breakfast buffet very seriously.\n\nAround the pool there are plenty of areas where you can find shade and relax. We spent the day relaxing by the pool and there were maybe 4 other people around. Overall, a very nice destination but you're in the middle of nowhere, don't expect a walk into the city.\n\nThey have a bar by the pool and another by reception which is not manned by a bartender although they say the bar is open 24\/7. They would do well if they were really open as it would be a good revenue stream. If you like to relax and have a quiet day, this is the place, perfect.","33109":"We stayed here as a family for ten days in July and we didn\u2019t want to leave.\n\nThis is a wonderful place to be. Borgo Pantano is set in the countryside about 15 minutes\u2019 drive from Siracusa; close enough to get to the restaurants, gelaterias and amazing historical sights, but far enough away to be able to forget about the world outside.\n\nThe hotel is clean and contemporary in style. It\u2019s peaceful, with lush, manicured grounds and a fantastic pool. The food is excellent; breakfast in particular is a daily feast, with a mind-boggling assortment of cakes, pastries, fruit, cheese, meats and savouries. I concentrated on the cannoli, paste di mandorla, doughnuts and cream filled croissants as it was, after all, a holiday!\n\nHowever, the thing that makes Borgo Pantano special is the people who run the place. From the owner who\u2019s there each morning to welcome you to breakfast, to her friendly and attentive team, who do everything they can to make your stay as comfortable as possible. A special mention should go to Olmo, who welcomed us when we arrived, gave us all the local information we needed and bravely gave is his WhatsApp contact in case we needed anything, wherever we were. He also offered to book everything from restaurant tables to sun-beds to guided tours. I\u2019m sure he must be exhausted by the end of each summer, but his work is hugely appreciated!\n\nThanks to everyone at Borgo Pantano. We\u2019ll be back!","33115":"The staff were so friendly and the facilities were fantastic. Olmo was particularly helpful and booked restaurants, taxis and a day tour for us to Noto, Ragusa and Modica with a tour guide called Luca who we highly recommend. The hotel offer a shuttle bus twice a day to Ortigia for \u20ac10 per room which is a nice touch and taxis for \u20ac20 before 10pm. We had stayed a night in Ortigia before our 3 nights here so we were quite happy to spend our days here by the pool which is lovely and the comfiest sun loungers we\u2019ve ever lay on. We were in a junior suite which had a sofa with a smart tv so we could watch Netflix in the evening. Breakfast was lovely but the evening meal not quite as consistent. The first night it was really tasty, but the second night could have been better. You will be very well looked after here. We had a very nice stay here and hope to return soon.","33117":"We stayed at other hotels in Sicily during this vacation but this hotel exceeded all our expectations. An outstanding hotel & certainly one we would highly recommend. Wonderful for families & couples too. Fantastic pool area and comfortable loungers & sofa\u2019s scattered around under trees & in the garden area for tranquility & relaxation. On arrival we were met by the General Manager, Ohlm & were given a full induction of the Hotel, facilities & nearby attractions. He went above and beyond. Communicating with us constantly & via a WhatsApp messaging service. He made himself available though-out our stay. As first time visitors to this region we though this was an invaluable service. We\u2019ve never experienced such personal interaction with Hotel management before. It was most welcomed. He offered Restaurant recommendations & sight seeing attractions in the area too. The convenience of a shuttle to Ortigia was an added benefit. The staff at the hotel were tremendous across all areas. Friendly & hospitable. Nothing was too much trouble. The very spacious tastefully decorated rooms were well maintained, fluffy towels, crisp linen & spotlessly made up. Loved the sufficient wardrobe space. Having a drying rack near our room outside was a wonderful touch, to hang up wet swim suits too. The breakfast was outstanding with a great variety of Sicilian delights. We ended up eating most nights at the Hotel as the dinner menu was a gastronomical delight, with a fabulous wine list. Chef recommendations every night were superb. An unexpected added touch, on a day when there was incremental weather, we opened our door to find an umbrella outside every guest room. The Management lead from the front door & they have thought of everything. All the staff were happy and hospitable. What a great experience. Thank you. Ps. We loved the Olive Oil in the restaurant & were delighted to know it was available to purchase.","33118":"We truly had a wonderful holiday, the place itself caters for all. The layout is perfect with ample space to find your perfect spot at any given time. More impressive was the hospitality of every single staff member, they truly go out of their way with impressive efficiency. Thank you to all the staff, especially to the charismatic Mr Olmo, super!!! Whatever guidance you need he is the man to sort you out, he is genuine and trustworthy in all senses. We will see you again very soon. Well done and tks again.","33119":"om check in to check out this hotel is probably the best hotel I have ever stayed at when it comes to hospitality and giving that personal touch.\n\nWe were firstly greeted by Olmo and given an explanation of the hotel and it's surroundings. He was patient, kind, professional and knowledgeable. Indispensable to the hotel.\n\nThe welcome pack and map were very useful too.\n\nThe surroundings were magnificent, comfortable car park, and a picturesque pool area. The staff by the pool were always very helpful and always went out of their way to please their guests.\n\nRooms were well equipped and clean. As soon as we entered the room we also found a frame with greetings. The frame had out names written down... Nice personal touch\n\nBreakfast was fantastic, large variety of homely products to satisfy all needs and allergens. I was also told that the breakfast changes everyday.\n\nWe also met the owner of the hotel at bfast. She makes it a point to be there every morning to speak to her guests and get feedback..\n\nThe rest of the staff were always smiling and also very helpful.\n\nA big well done to all the team. Keep it up. You should all be proud of yourselves!","33121":"We stayed at Borgo Pantano in August and had an amazing time, thoroughly relaxing and a beautiful setting. The grounds of the hotel are lovely and the pool especially is stunning. The staff at the hotel are all delightful, so warm and friendly and nothing is too much trouble. Olmo, the concierge helped us on numerous occasions, making and changing beach club bookings, recommending restaurants in Noto and nothing was too much trouble. He really went above and beyond what one would expect from a small hotel and for this, we were hugely grateful, he is an unbelievable asset to the hotel. Overall, we loved Borgo Pantano and hope to return!","33124":"Location\nDon\u2019t be put off by the area around the hotel; it is located in open countryside which is rather barren and run-down, similar to many of the rural parts in this south-east corner of Sicily. This made for testing driving at times in a hire-car. However, Ortigia is only a 15 minute drive away, with convenient parking at Parkering Syracusa off Via Bengassi for walking over the bridge into the old town.\nOnce the electric gates of the hotel open, you enter a world of calm and relaxation and high quality surroundings.\n\nCheck-in and \u2013out\nThis was smooth, friendly and efficient, both times.\n\nRooms\nRooms do vary quite a lot, but all are very clean and well-presented. You get what you pay for of course and the junior suites are the most comfortable and sizeable.\n\nRestaurant\nWe found the breakfast to be outstanding each morning and there is a choice of eating inside (in the comfort of air-condtioning) or on the shaded terrace. We also took two evening meals at the hotel. which were good. Service at breakfast and dinner was warm, friendly and attentive.\n\nPool and grounds\nThis is a highlight at the hotel. The grounds are incredibly well-thought-out and manicured. The two pools (large swimming pool and warm \u2018jacuzzi\u2019 pool) are excellent. There are also many different kinds of loungers available throughout the hotel\u2019s grounds. Despite the hotel being full, it never felt cramped and there are so many nooks and crannies available for lounging with a good book.\nThe pool bar is manned by friendly and efficient staff, and decent al fresco lunches and drinks are available at lunch time.\n\nStaff\nYou would be hard-pressed to find better in any hotel. The staff here obviously work as a team and are committed to providing great service with warmth and a smile.\n\nTo sum up, don\u2019t hesitate to book if you are looking for a relaxing, service-orientated base in the Syracuse area. Looking for negative points would be doing this hotel an injustice.","33126":"Borgo Pantano sits in \u201ccampagnia\u201d aka back country very close to Ortigia. Let me give you some factual stuff first and then I will give you my thoughts on why you should stay here.\n\nGrounds:\nThe hotel is literally surrounded by acres of lemon and organge trees. It smells Great. Yes I mean that - the air actually smells good. The grounds are gorgeous and it is very tranquil. The owner (Giusi) put a lot of thought into the design of the place so there are wonderful shady spots and little stone alcoves all over.\n\nThe pool is excellent. 5 star resort quality. There is bar service at the pool and the drinks are great.\n\nFood and services:\nBreakfast is art here. Every morning the owner herself presented an elaborate breakfast. I\u2019ve never seen something like this in my many trips to Italy. Think Italian breakfast tapas laid out across a quaint dining room with a picturesque patio to eat al fresco. There were easily 40-50 different breakfast items and they changed every day. Lunch is served in a garden and gazebo near the pool and the menu is relatively straight forward but of very good quality.\n\nSpa - they have a single person use spa here. The facility was very nice and the massage therapist was good. I would say it\u2019s a nice perk to have for sure but it shouldn\u2019t be the focal point of your stay.\n\nKids club - yes they actually have a kids club and it is included in the stay. The person that runs the club is excellent. I cannot say enough good things about her. She does with the children all the things you don\u2019t want to do at home - letting them bake cookies, make slime, etc... and she will take them swimming at the pool too so parents can relax.\n\nConcierge - I could not write this review without mentioning Olmo, the hotel\u2019s concierge. He has to be one of the best I\u2019ve ever interacted with and that\u2019s includes my stays at four seasons and mandarin orientals. He knows everyone and was able to get us basically whatever we needed - from ocean front beach setup at a top notch beach club to short notice reservations at fully booked restaurants. And he is a hell of a nice guy too.\n\nRooms:\nWe stayed in a suite with our children. The room was spotless, the bed was firm but comfortable and the bathroom was modern with high end fixtures. And very importantly the A\/C worked great in the middle of the summer!\n\nLocation:\nAs I mentioned, this hotel is not in Siracusa or ortigia proper. However it is very close and I would suggest you consider something especially if traveling to Siracusa in the summer. The city bakes in the heat. It is almost unbearable from about 12pm-5pm. Siracusa is almost deserted during those hours as all the locals go to the beach. Most stores are closed then too. Other than spending one day exploring the architecture the best time to be in ortigia is at night. The city comes alive and it\u2019s a blast!\n\nBorgo Pantano is a 15-20 minute car ride away and if you don\u2019t want to deal with driving the hotel has free transfers or if you want maximum flexibility like we did - the hotel arranged a beautiful Mercedes taxi for us each night for a whopping 20 Euro - a total steal.\n\nMy best advice is if you are planning only 1-2 nights in Siracusa then maybe you stay in the city. Anything more and you are going to be very happy that you have a pool, some tranquility and you are closer to all the best beaches.\n\nIf you have children - stop looking and just book this place. We felt like we were staying at a beautiful Caribbean resort during the day with all of the advantages of being in a magnificent Sicilian city at night.","33131":"An great overall experience. Staff is friendly, location is great to explore Ortigia, breakfast was even in Corona times exquisite. The rooms were spacious, clean and quiet. We got an upgrade to the stylish junior suite. Very good choice to stay in Siracusa! Thanks to all the staff for giving us this great experience!","33135":"We stayed in the Caportigia for two nights. The staff are very kind. The rooms are modern and very clean. The hotel also has an amazing terrace with amazing panoramic views. We enjoyed a great dinner in the hotel's restaurant.","33151":"Beautiful hotel with perfect service, clean room, good location, breakfast was amazing, all staff speak English, definitely it is the best hotel I have ever been in Siracusa. Will come again. recommended","33153":"Newly renovated hotel at a very good location.Ortigia is just at 10 minutes walking distance.\nExcellent staff at reception and at restaurant.Always eager to help with a smile.Veronica\nat reception is really helpful in explaining the topography of old and new city.She also offered a nice cup of cappuccino as i was waiting for check in.\nVery nice rooms with nice toiletries.Lighting arrangement was superb too.\nBut hotel was not air conditioned and one needs to open the windows for air circulation which brings lot of street noise along disturbing your sleep.\n\nBreakfast spread is very good and housekeeping was very nice too.\nOverall a ver good experience.","33155":"The hotel is comfortable with a lovely view of the city, sea, and Mt. Etna. It is, however, up a steep windy road from the center of the city. Although we drove to the hotel, we took a taxi to dinner.","33160":"Everything was great here: nice room, lovely bathroom, perfect location with short walking distance to Ortigia, friendly and helpful staff, easy parking.\nThe breakfast was outstanding.\nI highly recommend this hotel!","33161":"I would just like to say what a fabulous time we had at this hotel. The staff are so friendly & always willing to help .\nThey advised us with what we should do in Syracuse . Recommend restaurants to us including their own restaurant.\nBreakfast was plentiful. Very clean hotel. Lovely toiletries too.\nGood location. I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to stay here again.\nThank you to Veronica & all her colleagues.","33164":"The Caportigia Boutique Hotel is exactly as the name suggests. Its a small boutique hotel ideally situated near the Ortigia Island in Siracusa.\nVeronica at reception helped find parking for the car and then made sure that we were comfortably settled into our room before starting our exploration of the nearby island. The rooms are well appointed, roomy with high ceilings and quiet. The staff are well trained to ensure you enjoy your stay. Breakfast is plentiful and delicious.\nThe hotel has an adjoining restaurant, il turanno, where again the service is excellent. The main attraction of Siracusa is the island of Oritigia which is just minutes away by foot and where there are lots of opportunities for food wine or coffee. It's a great place to stay.","33165":"This hotel disappointed us in several ways. We booked a junior suite which was on 2 levels and firstly had the most dangerous stairs to the bed area I have ever seen for a newish build. If you need the toilet in the night god help you. Then we were woken at 6.30am with constant banging on our ceiling from the terrace above where a group were having early breakfast.\nWe then moved rooms and were downgraded and the hotel would not refund the difference in the room costs. Eventually they agreed to a credit in the restaurant.\nOn the positive side good beds, bathrooms, free Wi-fi and a nice breakfast. Location good with a short walk to Ortigia island. Parking outside free but spaces limited.\nOn balance not 5* and overpriced.","33167":"Wonderful contemporary property, a few hundred metres from the island of Ortigia. Very helpful and obliging staff - particular shout out for Barbara in the restaurant, as well as the front desk. Spacious and well appointed room in quiet part of town. Quality restaurant with innovative dinner menu and generous breakfast.","33168":"This is a lovely ultra modern hotel. Breakfast was beautifully laid out with a great choice of of dishes. Rooms were spacious and very clean, Would have been nice to have a view, we had no view at all. Window faced an inner space. Unfortunately, when we stayed the sun umbrellas had been damaged on roof, there was therefore, nowhere to sit outside. There was also no real lounge area apart from a few seats near reception. There is walk to get into old town which if you are a tourist might not be what you are looking for. The staff were very helpful at reception. I think this is more of a deluxe business hotel.","33170":"Fantastic and beautifull hotel, the staff is allways there for you. Nice and brand new rooms... The most well served breakfast that I ever saw. The location is amazing, 10 minutes walking to the old historic town. Is you are looking for a real luxury boutique hotel, thats it.","33171":"This hotel is such a great place to stay. It oozes excellence at all levels. You feel at ease as soon as you reach the reception area, with its layout and elegant characteristics. Everything is high quality \u2013 the staff are absolutely fantastic; so friendly, so welcoming, so professional, and this comment includes all staff, whether it is those who greet you at reception, or those who serve you in the restaurant, or those who undertake the day-to-day maintenance.\nThe rooms are extremely well-appointed, with quality fixtures and fittings. The food at breakfast was very good, providing a wide choice, with all items well-prepared and of high quality. On one evening we used the restaurant for dinner, and again the food was excellent, and served by people who cared. An exceptional place to stay.\nWell done to all at the Caportigia Boutique Hotel.","33172":"Probably one of the best hotels we\u2019ve ever stayed. The whole atmosphere of the place is friendly and homely, the breakfast is more than *****. The restaurant is excellent. The stuff very helpful.\nThe place of the hotel is very convenient for every must see you can imagine.","33174":"Beautiful and bright room, fantastic breakfast. Maybe they should do something for the morning light in the room that's annoying if you want to sleep a little more. Good position to visit by walk Ortigia and to go to the greek theatre. Receptionist really kind especially Martina.","33175":"If you are driving, and require parking, you do NOT want to have a hotel on Ortigia island. This hotel, which offers parking, is 3 blocks from the bridge to the island, which is where all of the sights and action is. The city of Siracusa is unspectacular and in most cases drab and uninviting. Ortigia is delightful. Well furnished large (for Italy) rooms with all amenities, recently updated.\nComfortable, perfect location, and affordable - with parking!","33177":"Loved our stay. The room was beautiful. The restaurant fell short with service. Slow help. Dirty plates sit too long.syaff confused, no direction. Breakfast was a highlight and not expensive. The noise in room necessitated ear plugs. The kitchen noise was heard in our 2 rooms. Front staff ladies kind of clueless. Not polished.","33180":"Spent 4 nights with my family in this beautifully renowned boutique hotel. A short walking distance from Caportigia, where you can find lovely restaurants and shops. The staff of the hotel was very helpful and nice, a special thanks to Veronica who advised us on good spots to visit.\nThe rooms were spacious and lovely. One thing I shall note is that there was no bathrobe in one of the rooms.\nBreakfast is good even though it could be improved. I would gladly comeback to this hotel.","33186":"Beautiful and new hotel! Fantastic breakfast and very good restaurant!\nWe really enjoyed and we will come back soon and we hope to find the same staff!\nThanks to all of you!The staff so friendly and helpful to organize our stay!","33187":"I got stuck in the elevator for 20 minutes with my 80-year-old mother. over 40 degree.\nAs a thank you from the hotel we received a glass of water for free after this bad experience :-) the price is to much high for this room.","33190":"We enjoyed the location and easy access to walk to Ortigia and also to bike to the Greek Amphitheater. Our Junior Suite with a Terrace and Jacuzzi was comfortable. We did not use the jacuzzi, but the terrace was nice to sit on and to dry out bathing suits.","33195":"We recently completed a 4 night stay at Caportigia. The initial impression on check-in is not favorable as they spend too much time explaining the additional costs and the room appears very small and filled with merchandise they are trying to sell.\n\nQuickly the warmth and professionalism of the staff starts to set the tone for the visit and you quickly start to feel comfortable and enjoy the beauty and design of this unique hotel. The common areas are gracious, lovely, and readily accessible to the guests. The staff is available, knowledgable and offer many good ideas for restaurants and destinations.","33197":"We spent 3 nights in the hotel and we are quite happy with it: good location, super helpful staff, breakfast fantastic. Some little details left us a bit puzzled especially the price of the extras: an omelette for breakfast is extra, the use of the jacuzzi is extra. Sorry for the price we paid I would expect all to be included. Anyway, it was a very nice holiday, not sure it is worthed all the money paid, but surely nice.","33217":"We weren't staying at the hotel but were staying locally in Ortigia. We booked the Spa for a weekday - massage and then the Spa. The Spa was beautifully clean and relaxing.\n\nTo top it off myself and my now fianc\u00e9 got engaged at the Spa and I can't thank the staff enough (Santino and Isabella) for making this such a special occasion!","33220":"Just returned from a week's stay at the Principe di Fitalia. The hotel was, as described by many others in Tripadvisor reviews, peaceful and remote - exactly what I was after! I'll do as another reviewer has done and list the pros and cons. However I should say, the Principe Fitalia is perfect for a quiet, relaxing break and the staff are excellent.\n\nPros:\n1. There are only 40 rooms and the whole time we were there (late Sept, early Oct) the hotel was extremely quiet with sometimes only 8-10 guests around the pool! I've never been somewhere so quiet and I enjoyed it!\n2. The fact the hotel is small means you don't have to clamour for a sunbed. In fact I've never been anywhere before where I could comfortably have my pick of the sunbeds still at 11am. No-one really reserved beds with towels - there simply wasn't a need to.\n3. Beautiful outdoor pool (albeit rather chilly!) and gardens area which are kept impeccably clean and tidy. The grounds are very attractive.\n4. The staff were, without exception, friendly and helpful. Special shout out to Chiara who made a special effort to chat to all guests, switching effortlessly between English, German, Italian and French.\n5. Because the hotel is in the middle of nowhere, there is a shuttle service which goes to Ortigia (20 mins away) 3 times per day. We made use of this 4 times and it was very handy - and free.\n6. Our room was modern and well equipped with both a bath and shower. We also discovered Netflix on the tv. Robes and flip-flops are provided in a beach bag to take to the pool.\n\nCons\/ Suggested improvements\n1. We were on a bed & breakfast package which meant either dining at the hotel or in Ortigia. Whilst the food at the hotel was fine, we both agreed we didn't think it warranted the price tag. A two course meal with an alcoholic drink each cost between \u20ac80 - \u20ac100 - and to be honest we had a much better meal in Ortigia for less than that. I think the quality of the food should match the price and this was a little disappointing.\n2. Whilst generally the pool area was quiet, there were two days where music\/ radio was playing quiet loudly from a loudspeaker at the pool bar. It's not really appropriate or wanted to have that level of music at a spa hotel where you specifically want to relax. If they really want to play music, caf\u00e9 del mar chillout would be more appropriate.\n3. The poolside bar menu is very limited and not cheap. The only thing on offer was a selection of paninis (variation on ham, cheese and tomato) and would set you back about \u20ac9. You couldn't even order a bowl of chips. So in the end we tended to have a big breakfast and skip lunch.\n4. Please NO CHILDREN in the indoor pool \/ spa area. The one time we used it, it was blissful for the first hour when we had it to ourselves. Then two families came in with children who made noise and one parent saw it fit to throw a ball around. It's really REALLY not appropriate to have kids in there when people are trying to relax. Especially when there's a kids' pool outside with slide and a designated playroom next door to the indoor pool where parents can take their offspring. I must admit, I found this really irritating.\n5. I should disclaimer my next comment by saying this is not the hotel's fault but the whole time we were there and lying by the pool, flies were a real issue. I think because the hotel is out in the countryside and near farms there were so many flies but many guests remarked that it was hard to relax on the beds by the hedges as every 10 seconds you had to swat a fly from your leg or face. We bought a fly spray but this had little to no effect. We found the sunbeds on the terrace were markedly better.\n\nAnd not really a con because it made us laugh so much but the entertainment (singer) at dinner at the weekend was not totally blessed with singing talent. I'm sure he's very nice but he was off-key and his repertoire was really weird - going from Frank Sinatra to Miley Cyrus, to Radiohead! But as I say, we enjoyed it but not necessarily for the right reasons!\n\nIn conclusion, lovely scenery, friendly staff and a relaxing break. Just be prepared that you really are out in the sticks so either take a car, or embrace a week on retreat! :-)","33222":"Lovely 5 star hotel in the country near Syracuse in Sicily. We had a jacuzzi suite which was excellent although the jacuzzi could have been hotter and it leaked! Breakfast and staff excellent. Check out 10am, which is far too early, but we were able to keep our room a bit later. Three swimming pools, one indoor. Gym. Free very good Wi-fi. Free easy parking. Good restaurant but menu limited and designed for those on half board.","33223":"Would definitely recommend this venue, fantastic friendly staff. Couldn\u2019t do enough to help and advice, the food was fantastic and the general atmosphere of the hotel was very relaxing and comfortable.","33224":"We had a memorable week in this superb hotel, with all the comfort and service one could wish for. Just one tip - be sure to take your Google \/ sat-nav device as it's very difficult to find ! But once you have, you won't ever want to leave.","33225":"This hotel ticks all the boxesThe location of the hotel could not have been better .\nStaff ,Room ,Facilities and food were all excellent .The entertainment in the evening was good .\nWe shall definately return .sooner than later.\nPau and Marilyn ,West Sussex Uk","33238":"We have just had a weeks holiday here and it was fantastic. Myself, husband and 15 year old son enjoyed practically everything about the hotel.\n\nThe pro\u2019s:\nStaff are amazing. Also having Chiara as guest relations is a perfect touch. Nothing is too much for them all.\nThe breakfast is fantastic but what really makes this place stand out is the dinner. The food is exceptional and the menu changes every night.\nAs gym goers we all rated the gym highly. Good equipment and variety.\nPool was perfect temperature and not too much chlorine.\nThe feel of the hotel is artsy, boutique and chic. Perfect for people looking for something a little different.\nThe rooms are amazing. We were so lucky to get an upgrade to a 2 bedroom suite with jacuzzi bath and jacuzzi outside. Highly recommend booking one of these.\nThe hotel shuttle takes you to town of Ortigia which is just a beautiful place with lots of things to do.\n\nThe con\u2019s:\nShuttle times out of the town are aren\u2019t great. You have either the 1.30pm or 7pm to catch back.\nThere isn\u2019t a shop in the hotel so make sure you stock up on sun cream.\nYou have to pay for drinks\/snacks to be brought to your sun lounger and room. Been to a lot of hotels around the world and have never had to do that.\nMy husband used the spa and his feed back on the massages was they should should do a package such as a massage every day should be reduced in price or buy 5 massages and get 1 free.\nThe beach club is nice but there is no beach. You do have to walk down steps and ramp till you reach a pebble edge into the sea.\nIt does say there are fitness classes and yoga however the only class we saw was an aqua aerobics class every other day and you have to book yoga but the receptionists were quite vague about it.\n\nAll in all this place is perfect for couples, families with young and older children. Highly recommend and will be back!","33247":"From the minute we set foot into the hotel, the staff greeted us warmly. The beautiful waft of the diffusers gently scented the reception\/downstairs communal areas. Decor had a modern, luxurious feel to it. The entire stay was a delight. The staff bent over backwards to ensure that the guest experience was an extremely pleasant one at all times.","33250":"We spent 4 nights at this hotell and we really enjoyed our stay here. The staff was really friendly all the time and everyone did their very best for us to enjoy our stay.\n\nThe room we had was very nice, we did a upgrade at arrival and the staff at the reception were very helpfull.\n\nThe pool area was amazing as well with splendid service and good drinks.\n\nAll the food we ate at the hotel was really good, all the way from breakfast to lunch and dinner. The best food we have had so far in Sicilia! Also the winelist and the knowledge of the staff regarding this was very impressive.\n\nThis hotel have now set a new standard for us and it won' be easy for other hotels to match this","33252":"Over all stay was amazing, beautiful welcome drink, room clean and well equipped only missing an iron take your own. The restaurant and chef first class, don\u2019t worry if you don\u2019t book a table you\u2019ll still get a seat. The spa is really relaxing and welcoming with all you could need, the indoor heated pool area is tranquil and inviting treatments well worth having and professional down to the smallest detail. The shuttle to beach area is only for direct bookings to the Hotel not TUI customers you can use the private are only you will be charged.","33255":"Stayed here for a night away to celebrate our anniversary. The hotel is amazing, the staff is wonderful, the spa very relaxing and the restaurant had delicious food! Can't wait to come back! We noticed how child friendly it is so we plan on bringing our son next time.","33257":"Highly recommend this hotel. Fantastic spa, great food, good facilities and incredible staff who are so helpful, polite and friendly. They could not do enough for us and we really appreciated it. They made us feel very special.","33258":"This is a nice relaxing hotel set a short drive from Siracusa.\n\nThe main positives for me were the 2 outdoor pools, indoor pool and well equipped gym. The shuttle service is a really good way of getting to and from Siracusa and is fairly frequent so allows you to enjoy the sights and sounds of the old town.\n\nTo push my rating from a 3.5 star to 5 star I think the hotel could make a few minor changes. The price of drinks is extortionate and roughly double what you pay in the centre of Siracusa. If the prices were reduced or a happy hour offered throughout the day I would have been more tempted to spend money at the hotel, as it was we bought a single drink during our stay.\n\nWater is safe to drink at the hotel but as with the rest of Sicily doesn't taste great and our experience would have been improved if we'd been given a bottle of water in our room each day.\n\nWe didn't eat dinner in the restaurant but the breakfast service was okay with an egg chef available each day. The choice wasn't as varied as other similarly rated hotels that I've stayed but is more than sufficient for a short stay.\n\nOverall a good hotel that could be great with some small changes.","33259":"Room very huge and well organized. The staff is very very kind and professional. The SPA is very beatyfull and well organized. The food is very good and well coocked, The breakfast is abundant and with many choices.","33264":"Great place to stay, really friendly staff who couldn't be more helpful. Great pools. Too cold to use the outdoor pool in April but the indoor pool was fantastic. The playroom is also a great asset. We had selected the half board option and the food was delicious.","33268":"We were one week at this hotel. Our room veranda had direct access to the small public sand beach with turquois waters. The hotel is pretty small with less than 20 rooms maybe half of it with the veranda to the beach. The beach gets crowded pretty on Sundays. The hotel provides you with sunbeds and an umbrella. The people at the beach were all friendly families and behaving well (no litter at the beach). For icecream or coffee there was a local bar. The restaurant Malafemmina was very good. Just don't order too much because the portions are huuuge. Special needs are taken care of, for instance my wife was made a special cake and scrambled eggs because of her gluten and lactose intolerance. Personel in generally very friendly. Apart from the food, the view from the restaurant is spectacular. The price was also very decent. I think it is the best place with a beach in eastern Sicily.","33278":"White Bay is an incredible hotel. Cosy (not a big hotel with too many rooms), perfect location (beatiful beach in front and close to Siracuse) and a wonderful staff, they all were very kind all the time. The room we stayed was spetacular with a pool\/jacuzi in the balcony.","33279":"We loved the balcony from where we had direct access to the beach - and means sound of the sea day and night :-) Breakfast at the hotel terrace with great seaview was already good so we decided to reserve there also for dinner - what a good decision! We enjoyed a 5-course-menu which was very tasty and well presented. If you need 2-3 days rest at Sicily this should be your preferred place!","33296":"We just went for a drink on a Saturday late morning and we were pleasantly surprised. Stunning location right on the beach , lovely bar staff especially Egidio I think his name was. Very friendly and helpful. Can\u2019t recommend it enough.","33299":"Seaside hotel, literally...just one step by our little terrace was the sandy beach.\nIt was lovely waking up, grabbing a cup of tea while watching the local fisherman doing their catches.\nEven if we were in a low season, staff was super kind and always attentive to our needs, specially with our little girl.\nBreakfast was quite well served with salty and sweet goodies, with delicious fresh squeezed orange juice!\nThe spa facilities are small but well designed; even you can get it for private if you book it in advance, same advice if you want a massage, they have a nice menu of them.\nLocation is quite convenient as you are in the middle of the majority of the must see, as Vendicari reserve, Marzamemi, Syracuse and surrounding attractions.\nIf once we are back in the area, for sure we would like to stay again there.","33305":"Lovely hotel right on the beach with friendly staff. Out of town and need to get taxi into town which is expensive. Very helpful staff, eager to please and very clean. Breakfast is good, dinner menu somewhat limited.","33311":"We have just returned from the White Bay resort, having spent a week there in August. The hotel itself is beautiful and right on the beach. We had a studio room with spa access. There was plenty of space, the room was clean and the view was amazing. There is an option to have breakfast in the room overlooking the beach, which we took advantage of.\nThe restaurant attached to the hotel also has amazing views. The food is spectacular- expensive but no more so than food of a similar standard elsewhere in Sicily.\nThe staff were lovely but I did have to ask 3 times if there were any local water sports. Each time I was informed that someone would get back to me. No one ever did and eventually I discovered some facilities by walking to the other end of the beach. I thought it was a bit odd that there was not much information provided about local amenities\/ restaurants etc. Taxis are expensive- 60 euros return to Syracuse which makes it an expensive night out if you do not have a car.\nWith regards to the site- the beach is beautiful but being a public beach is absolutely packed in August. This means that there is no privacy on the balcony and it can be quite noisy until late at night. We were also woken at 6am at every morning by a very noisy vehicle, sounding what seemed like a warning bell as the beach was cleaned.I therefore recommend packing some earplugs.\nAccess to the spa does sound lovely but was not free, even though we had the \u2018 spa \u2018 room. We ended up not using it in the end.\nAll in all , this is a great hotel and location but if I were to go again, I would certainly avoid August and would probably hire a car.","33326":"A Little(15 rooms) Juwel in th\u00e9 Sicilian Coast, We spend two dans in a very beautiful suite , seafront and balcony on th\u00e9 beach.\nTh\u00e9 p\u00e9ople Nice, th\u00e9 facilities gr\u00e9\u00e2t , very clear th\u00e9 water, Sandy beach, Nice SPA inside.\nTh\u00e9 restaurant upstairs is \u00ab Malafemina \u00bb!","33327":"We visited the hotel this June for a week, beautiful beach room, excellent breakfast, and restaurants both for dinner and a more casual lunch. Well situated for trips to Siracusa, Noto etc.but you do need a car for this. Staff extremely helpful and friendly nothing was too much trouble. We will be rebooking next year......spa looked lovely too!","33330":"We stayed in a beachfront suite in the White Bay. It was modern and comfortable and most of the staff were friendly and helpful especially the cleaning ladies who always got rid of all the sand.\n\nThe bathroom was obviously quite new but the toilet rocked which was a bit disturbing.\n\nUpon arrival were were given all sorts of discounts off food, but not told to reserve, off a spa but no idea what there was other than massages (and I do think that was most of it) and a welcome drink.\n\nParking is very tight so hire a small car.\n\nHaving said all that the view is spectacular and it was nice to do a little sightseeing in the morning and come back to the beach in the afternoon.\n\nAltogether a 4 but with a little more thought a 5.","33333":"We stayed at this very nice B&B for 1 week.\nGood location, walking distance to Ortigia and just a few minutes walking distance from the train station.\nProfessional and welcoming on arrival . Giovanni and Eleonora have good knowledge of the area and Sicily. Tips \/ information on what to visit and different types of restaurants that have good local dishes\n\nRooms: Clean and tidy, comfortable beds. The room was spacious with good shower and toilet\nBreakfast: High quality products and their home-made jams should not be forgotten, they were really good. An experience watching a slideshow of the area during breakfast on a large LED TV .\n\nGiovanni was always helpful and wanted that everything was good, accessible by questions via mobile phone during the days.","33335":"Three nights in a charming and well equipped B&B close to everything you need to see and do in Syracuse. Lovely hosts who provide a wealth of information about visiting Syracuse. Light and airy rooms with a very pleasant breakfast with plenty of friendly chatter. Well worth a stay.","33336":"This place is located minutes walk from most the places you want to be. The hosts were really nice and friendly. Also very helpful. breakfast was really good, especially the homemade canolo! The apartment is really nice decorated with photos taken by the host (his name is escaping me right now. Oye vey). You'll have a pleasant time staying here.","33337":"I had a room next to the kitchen\/dining area and the noise was excessive starting at 7:30 am. The B&B also lacks any common lounge space. On the positive side, the room was small but very clean and the hosts are delightful.","33338":"PhotoGuest B&B is strategically located between the archeological park and the \u201cisland\u201d with all its historic charm. Located in a renovated apartment, it is clean and modern and cheerful. Giovanni\u2019s photos of Siracusa that are displayed throughout are the icing on the cake. Breakfasts are delicious and you will meet other interesting guests at the big table.\n\nIt\u2019s a real find and a great choice in Siracusa!","33339":"Do enjoy this well designed, and perfectly located, B & B. The hosts were knowledgeable, helpful and great sources of information on where to eat and where to visit. Giovanni has utilized his photography expertise as a centerpiece for the exceptional design elements in his beautiful home. Highly recommended and do follow up on his restaurant suggest. All were among the best food we had In Sicily.","33340":"I couldn't rate this B & B highly enough. The hosts went to great lengths to make sure we enjoyed our stay. They helped us book tours and advised us on trips. On our final day, knowing my husband was a chef, they showed us how to make a traditional dessert. The B & B is modern but very comfortable.","33341":"The property is on the 4th floor of an apartment block,.There is a lift. Small communal breakfasting area with the rooms off one corridor. Our room had a balcony overlooking the shopping street. The room was clean and spacious with good air conditioning. The breakfast was lovely and the hosts were very helpful in suggesting and booking local restaurants. It was easy to walk to all the tourist sites from the property.","33343":"My husband and I spent two nights at PG in September. We arrived much earlier than check in time and were met and welcomed by the charming hosts, Giovanni and Eleanora. We were in our lovely, airy room early which helped us out considerably to freshen up in the excellent shower. Breakfast was a treat, homemade goodies, light croissants, boiled eggs and lots of English tea which we love. We were made to feel thoroughly at home. Highly recommend!","33345":"Wonderful stay with hosts Giovanni and Eleonora who were perfect. Great location with convenient free parking allowed us to walk to everything (Giovanni parked the car for us upon arrival and we didn\u2019t move it for two days. ) Ortygia, the Greek amphitheater, the Archeological Museum are all less than 10 minutes walking away. Eleonora and Giovanni serve up an ample and varied breakfast to get you going and provide all sorts of advice and suggestions on where to go. PhotoGuest B&B is a great place to stay during a visit to this fascinating city. And you can enjoy Giovanni\u2019s beautiful photos that decorate all the rooms.","33347":"Very nice bed and breakfast, 5 minutes from the train station. The hosts Giovanni and Eleonora are very kind and supported us with everything we needed. They know Syracuse very well and hat a lot of very good tips for us.","33348":"PhotoGuest is a wonderful B&B with lovely charm and modern decor. The room itself (including the bathroom) was very clean and comfortable, as was the dining area. The location of PhotoGuest was ideal. Everything is close by - the historical tourist attractions, restaurants, cafes and the sea front are no more than 10 minutes walk. Giovanni and Eleanora are excellent hosts and very much make you feel at home - nothing is too much trouble. Giovanni\u2019s extensive knowledge of Syracuse meant he could answer all of our questions. He made some great recommendations for places to eat, attractions to visit and excursions to go on. Giovanni also went out of his way to make dinner reservations and book my husband and I on excursions. Breakfast was delicious everyday. I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to recommend PhotoGuest if you are visiting Syracuse. 10 out of 10!","33350":"My wife and I stayed here in July and our experience while at the property was largely positive. However after we checked out and had left Syracuse, the proprietor asked us to pay an additional e15 per night for a second guest. Notwithstanding that our booking stipulates that \"the base rate is for two people\", I told Giovanni if I owed him money of course I would pay, and I asked him to provide me an invoice which he has not done. Meanwhile I checked both the online booking site and Photoguest's own booking site, and the differential in tariff for two-guests-rather-than-one is several euros, not e15, and I pointed this out to Giovanni. I have not heard further from him except for a rude response to an overwhelmingly positive review I posted on Expedia (this response has since been taken down). This behaviour has tainted my view of this property and is reflected in my above rating, and I would neither stay there again nor recommend it.","33352":"We stayed for four nights at PhotoGuest B&B. The location is perfect, the B&B is beautifully decorated and clean, the breakfast is wonderful, and Giovanni and Eleanora are friendly and helpful hosts. Highly recommended.","33354":"Syracuse was our first stop during a 3-week Sicily round trip and we stayed 4 nights at the PhotoGuest B&B. This was a great start for our trip as we immediately felt welcome, with Giovanni reaching out before our arrival to make sure that we found our way around and that we could check in when arriving in Syracuse.\nRoom was very modern and clean (and with a balcony where we typcally relaxed after a day of exploring and dinner) and breakfast was great (good selection of fruit, home-made jam and cake, croissants etc.).\nApart from a convenient location roughly between Ortigia and the main archeological site, the friendliness and helpfulness of our hosts Giovanni and Eleonora would clearly make us come back again if we visit Syracuse in the future.\nWe got fantastic e.g. guidance for day trips (where to go, where to park etc.) and restaurants, including help with reservations.\nThanks a lot!","33355":"Bdeautifully furnished B and B in the centre of town, within easy walking distance of restaurants, and the historic area of the town, including the island of Ortigia. Our room was well appointed, elegant and stylish, a beautiful bathroom and spotlessly clean. Our hosts, Giovanni and Eleonara, went out of their way to make us feel welcome and provide advice and interesting converation. Breakfasts were quite excellent with a large and varied choice, including some of Eleonara's home cooking. Thank you both, a stay we will remember and we wish you well for the future","33356":"We searched and searched for a reasonable but, comforting place to stay in Sycrause and found PhotoGuest B&B. It is located on one floor of mutipurpose building that Giovanni and his wife operate with maybe 6 rooms to rent out all new in fixtures and furniture. They both have a passion for their small B&B. Normally we stay in hotles, but fond this placing modern, effective, comfortable and clean. At breakfast at the communal table we met others from Ireland, NYC and England which we enjoed learnign about others instead of staying at different tables. Giovanni parked our car and helped bring in luggage. The bathrooms and bedrooms were spacious compared to some of the other places we stayed in. It was approx. 7\/8 minutes to Ortiga isand and about 10 minutes to the Greek\/roman ruins you have to visit. Both were always helpful in planning our day as well as restaurant choices, and would call ahead to help location restaurants when we were on Ortiga. We felt very grateful and luckly to find such a nice couple always willing to help. We would stay there again! he also has an interest in photography and his walls are covered with his photos of island, while his wife is tourist guide who gave us plenty of suggestions for our day.","33357":"My husband and I stayed at PhotoGuest for three nights in late May. From the moment of my first email to our last seconds in town Giovanni was always available and always in touch.Both he and Eleanora make it clear that they want you to not only fully enjoy their home but also Siracusa.\nThe B & B is perfectly located and the ability to have Giovanni help with the car was a huge plus for us. The rooms are big, modern and extremely comfortable. Breakfasts were plentiful and it was an added plus to sit with other guests and share experiences and recommendations. Restaurant recommendations were excellent.\nIf we ever return to this area which we hope to do, we would not hesitate to stay here.","33358":"No regrets,highly recommended.Wifi,parking,location all fine.Wonderful hosts,no questions unanswered,best info point in town.Nice guests to share.Fruitful morning meetings.Very good air conditioning..","33359":"Giovanni and Eleanora are warm and welcoming and can\u2019t do enough for you. Giovanni is the photographer of the artwork and both bake an excellent cake! Breakfast is a delight with home made marmalades and a huge variety of dishes to choose from. The rooms are modern and very well presented; the bed very comfortable. Eating out recommendations were perfect and Ortigia is only a 5 minute walk. We hope to be back in Sicily and will definitely stay at Photo Guest again. Highly recommend","33360":"We enjoyed a very pleasant stay at this convenient B&B. Giovanni is an excellent host, with fluent English, and made us very much at home. Breakfast was plentiful, always with a fresh homemade cake. It was useful to have free parking right outside too.","33361":"Good central location, Giovanni made the best homemade cannolis, Both he and Leonora were the perfect hosts and her\ncakes were wonderful.\nThey were one of the highlights of our trip and they will be missed","33363":"As other reviews have already mentioned, Giovanni and Eleonora are gracious, friendly and helpful. Giovanni helped me park my car when I arrived, which took a lot of stress out of arrival. Eleonora gave great recommendations for restaurants, including Retroscena which was just great. Thank you so much for making our one night in Siracusa so perfect!","33364":"There\u2019s nothing lied in previous reviews. The rooms, the location, breakfast, everything is perfect.\nHosts Giovanni and Eleonora invented hospitality and they have good advices for sightseeing in syracusa and other places at this very nice island. Highly recommended","33365":"Nice place to stay in Syracusa. Perfectly located to visit the city. The room was clean and modern. The breakfasts were good. Giovanni and El\u00e9onore are very nice and give great tips. We would definitely recommend this place","33366":"An excellent B&B - great bed, great shower and great cleanliness. Recently refurbished to a high standard. Modern and convenient design. Property located within easy walking distance of key sites within Siracusa and Ortigia. The owner and his wife have exceptional knowledge of the area and are extremely helpful in providing advise on what to see and how best to experience - highly recommended.","33368":"It was very helpful to use WhatsApp prior to arrival to coordinate timing. We used it both the send messages and to call. Giovanni helped park the car for us. Photoguest is on the 4th floor of the building but there is an elevator. The location is great for walking.","33370":"This was the perfect place to spend 4 days in Syracuse. The location is excellent for site seeing as well as visiting Ortega all on foot. The room was very clean and modern, the facilities within the room all looked brand new (or very well maintained), all rooms have a big shared balcony which is nice, and the hosts Giovanni and Eleonora were very helpful and friendly, and gave us good tips on where to go and where to eat.\n\nWould definitely be my top choice when I visit again.","33371":"The place is located within walking distance from Ortiga and all the main attractions. The room was lovely, comfortable bed and good shower. It's by a main road but you can't really hear the noise. Best thing about this place is the host who made us feel most welcome and gave some tips on what to do in the area.","33372":"There are few things in life that makes you say that is perfect. Giovanni and Eleanora\u2019s place is one of them. You start your stay as guests and when you leave you have two great friends. They complete each other as they do complete your stay. Professional, warm, helpful, clean and upscale service...","33373":"I am an American traveling through Italy for two months and have stayed and many hotels and B&B's along the way. Some great...some not so good as a lot of properties in Italy are very dated. The PhotoGuest B&B is perfect with up to date contemporary furnishings which is hard to find in Italy. The property is also in a perfect location 10 minute walk to the archaeological sights of Siracusa and 10 minute walk to the historic area of Ortigia. The property is also just outside of the ZTL zone so you can get here and park without entering the ZTL. The owners, Giovanni and Eleanora, are super nice and go out of their way to make recommendations. Eleanora is also a tour guide and was very helpful with suggesting things to see and do. The breakfast was also great. I travel a lot for work and leisure and I would not hesitate to recommend this property to anyone.","33375":"As a non italian speaking visitor touring southern italy it was thanks to giovannis help that I arrived safely ......he even emailed me a phrase to show the bus driver so he might stop almost at the b\/b which he did....eleonoras welcome cup of tea was just what was needed and her knowlegde about the area was extremely helpful in planning my stay..the room was modern and comfortable with a small balcony overlooking the street.....ideally placed near bus\/train station and midway between the archealogical site and the old town of ortigia....lots of giovannis photographs to admire....would certainy stay here again..","33376":"Great place to stay. Within walking distance of everything. Exceptionally quiet and comfortable rooms. Eleonora et Giovanni treated us like family and couldn't be more helpful with directions and recommendations. You won't be disappointed with your stay there.","33380":"Giovanni and Eleonora proved to be very welcoming and gracious hosts. The room was modern, clean and comfortable, breakfast very good and the B&B as a whole a delight for these weary travellers. Location was only a short walk to Ortigia. An added bonus was Giovanni\u2019s excellent photographic talents on display throughout the B&B.","33381":"This B & B is perfectly located in Syracuse, half way between Ortigia and the Archeological Park. The hosts, Giovanni and Eleanora are exceptional. The directions we received were spot on and on arrival Giovanni came out to meet us and parked our car close by and in a very safe spot. Giovanni and Eleanora gave so much useful information on what to see, opening hours etc and they happily made a dinner reservation for us. Our room was spotless and very modern and the bathroom very stylish. Giovanni is a photographer and his work is displayed in the rooms and common areas. The photos make you want to find the places they show and visit them at different times of the day and year. Breakfast was plentiful and there was a good variety of fruits, cereals, breads, jams etc., many homemade and delicious. I had an impromptu photography lesson from Giovanni when I spoke about my interest. This young couple are fantastic hosts and really go out of their way to ensure you enjoy your stay in their city. I would recommend the location, the breakfast, the comfortable bed, the lovely hosts and the captivating city.","33383":"Our experience was a complete pleasure. Giovanni and Eleonora made us feel so very welcome. They gave us a detailed summary of the highlights of places to visit and restaurant recommendations. The B & B is in a great location, is very clean, the rooms are quiet, the bed was super comfortable, a modern bathroom,and lovely breakfast. They are a delightful young couple that clearly enjoy the experience of owning a B & B and taking care of their guest. This is place is a real find!","33385":"My wife found PhotoGuest and thought that I'd especially like staying there since I'm a serious amateur photographer. The excellent reviews made our choice to stay here a no brainer. I can only repeat what others have said. Giovanni and Eleonora are the most gratious and personable hosts. The accommodations are modern and spotlessly clean. Great breakfasts and tourtist tips on what to visit rounded out our 3 night stay. Giovanni's recommendation of a nearby restaurant proved to be excellent. We try not to repeat on our trips, but ate there every night. I also got some good photo tips.","33386":"We loved our stayed at PhotoGuest. Our host host were really friendly and helpfully especially Giovanni who waited patiently to park our car. The B&B is in the perfectly located as you are in walking distance of the old town and the archaeology sites. This is the perfect place to stay in Syracuse, you will no regret staying here. T","33387":"Our hosts, Eleonora & Giovanni, are lovely, intelligent people who have created a beautiful space in an apartment building. The B & B is very well- located because it is a 15 minute walk both from the archeological sites and the old town of Ortigia, which is a charming spot. Giovanni actually came down and parked our car for us, which definitely reduced our stress, as the B&B is on a busy neighborhood.","33389":"The \"photo\" part of the name is referring to our host's being a wonderful photographer and the place is decorated with enlargements of his work. It's clean, comfortable, well located. Giovanni and Eleonora are lovely, helpful, personable. Eleonora is a tour guide, so her expertise about Siracusa is invaluable. We are so happy to have met them and stayed at their beautiful B & B where we enjoyed an wonderful breakfast.","33390":"Giovanni and Eleonora were exceptionally helpful and friendly hosts. The accommodation was well located half way between the archaeological sites and the old town of Ortygia and had been recently renovated to a high standard","33391":"From beginning to end, my experience at Photo Guest was superb. Giovanni greeted us, parked our car and took care of our bags.The apartment was ideally located, had an elevator, and was beautifully decorated with Giovanni's gorgeous photos. The room, and all of the apartment, was immaculate and inviting. The breakfast, prepared by adorable Eleanora, was sumptuous. Eleanora was quite helpful giving invaluable tips for our exploration of Ortigia. She made our day.","33393":"We enjoyed 2 nights here and loved this B&B's modern euro charm. Spacious room (and shower) comfy beds, super clean and great location within walking to Ortigia Island. We had a rental car and found parking within 2 blocks. The hosts had exceptional knowledge of Siracusa and the surrounding areas. Their English is very good which was helpful as they recommended our fav stop enroute to Agrigento. Breakfast was very good, euro continental with juices and fresh croissants.","33395":"The place was elegant and very clean, the owners most kind.the location was excellent, too. The walls were decoeated with excellent photos, taken by the owner Giovanni.The breakfast was good. I recommend this place to anyone.","33396":"Where to start! PhotoGuest B&B in Siracusa is the ONLY place to stay if you are visiting this enchanting city. It is located halfway between Ortygia and the Parc Archaologica which makes it perfect for walking in either direction. Giovanni and Elenora will make you feel so welcome. They are both so lovely and willing to answer any and all questions about what to see and do, not only in Siracusa but throughout Sicily! The rooms are new, beautiful, super clean, and have everything you need. The breakfast is outstandingly delicious and plentiful. And, if you are lucky enough to sit on the right side of the table, you will be treated to a fantastic slideshow of Giovanni's photos of Siracusa, Overall, the best travel experience we have had in Sicily. Grazie! Grazie! Grazie!","33400":"This lovely hotel suited our purposes perfectly. It is a great jumping off point from which to explore the delights of south-eastern Sicily and is close to the historically significant city of Syracusa. The rooms are spacious (indeed the whole place has a feeling of openness and peace) and immaculate with beautiful, bougainvillea-clad walkways to the central building. Some parts of the garden walls are looking ready for a refresh. The restaurant is very good indeed and the separate breakfast room is perfect, providing a broad range of choices to set one up for the day. Thoroughly recommended, even for non-golfers like us!","33402":"We have booing of two suites, but instead giving us two suite, we were given one suite end one supior room. Honest we don\u2019t care. At time of booking, we didn\u2019t select 2 adults and 2 children. We are asked to pay \u20ac60 extra per night. It was a long day. We are very tired. The reception was very insisted we got to pay, even I explained to her that we have two rooms, each room is allowed to accommodate two person, why we had to pay extra, even for two children, we booked for one suite for them to stay and We didn\u2019t excess number of person staying. And we didn\u2019t care you give us a low range room.\n\nGeneral, we always book to stay a real 5 star hotel. But this is first time ever the service is worse we have ever experienced, just felt so uncomfortable and unpleasant. We don\u2019t feel we are here to enjoy the holiday. We husband was feeling so humiliated. They generally had no respect to us at all.\n\nRoom condition is cheap, it looks trendy, but details is cheap. Our 1st night, the bathroom was flooded and we called twice, no one bother to fix it. Suite is actually strong smell of mold.\n\nWeather still vary warm and pleasant for swimming, but the water is so cold.\n\nWe just regretted very minute that we booked this terrible hotel.","33406":"We stayed one week at the hotel half board. There were four of us staying in 2 rooms.\nPros: excellent food in restaurant for dinner, good swimming pool, very friendly staff, good spa.\nCons: the shower temperature varied in use, no dressing gown in rooms (we expect to have gowns in 5 star hotels)\nWe would stay again definitely.","33409":"We booked this resort via secret escapes for a family holiday which included our 10month old grandson. We wanted to explore Sicily and visit beaches but also historic sites . It looked beautiful and well located near Syracuse and beaches near by. Mostly it lived up to this. Although must stress a car is essential if you intend to go off the resort.It is at least a 10 minute drive to the nearest small town and any shops or eateries. Siracusa is 25 minutes drive and nearest beach 15 minutes. The hotel does not provide any shuttle or transport.\nThe hotel itself is very charming..rooms are clean and spacious with good bathrooms shower only in standard\/superior rooms. Niggles that lost points for us were lack of storage draws in the room for clothes etc..we stayed a week and struggled with where to put stuff. No kettle in the room was annoying especially as we arrived late and would have loved a cup of tea..complimentary water would have been nice . My daughter brought a travel kettle for the baby bottles just as well...\nSome of the outside spaces were starting to look a little tired in need of a lick of paint..plaster damaged on walls. The pool was large with plenty of sunbeds which we enjoyed and there was a shallow area for children.\nFood ..breakfast was good with a wide choice of fruit yoghurt pastries and some cooked items. Extras could be paid for like salmon etc. The resteraunt is not cheap about \u00a335 a head food only and wine \u00a330 plus a bottle..we found the menu very limited especialy as one person was vegetarian and portions very small. We tended to eat when out late lunch early supper.if you want an inexpensive meal there are a few good pizza places in Floridia 10 min drive or good choices in Syracusa. The pool bar serves toasties and a good salad at reasonable prices up to 6pm but is limited.\nStaff were lovely especially reception and Adriana deserves special mention..she was extremely helpful and gave lots of tips and advice on places to visit and eat plus wine tasting.\nFor a short golfing holiday the resort is ideal. For a week family holiday we would probably not return here unless the above were addressed.","33412":"good points\n-some helpful staff\n-good massage in Spa\n-peaceful location\n-comfortable beds\n\nareas to improve\n-golf course very poorly maintained\n-meals of variable quality\/quantity\n-staff serve others\/take phone calls in middle of serving (Italian?)\n-damp\/mould problems in corridors outside bedrooms rooms","33415":"My husband and I enjoyed our 2 night stay at I Monasteri. The staff were helpful, rooms were bright, clean and nicely appointed and the swimming pool and golf course were great. We took the half board option because it was great value. The dinner menu was great with plenty of delicious choices. We regretted not using the Catania airport to hotel transfer that was available for 95 euros. We opted to catch a taxi from the airport and despite agreeing with the driver that the fare would be 100 euros we fell into some sort of Sicilian taxi scam where the driver starts demanding we pay 120 euros half way to the resort.. and threatens to pull over and ditch us in the middle of no where if we refuse... An unfortunate start to our Sicilian vacation and one which many other travellers also experienced. One couple we met was threatened into paying 218 euros from Catania Airport to Taormina.. more than twice the cost advertised at the airport.","33420":"I did a lot of research before choosing this hotel in Southern Sicily. One of the main reasons was that unlike most hotels in the area it has a swimming pool. The pool area is large and has plenty of sun beds, plenty of towels etc. There is a pool bar for drinks and snacks with friendly service.\nThe drive up to the hotel is impressive along a tree lined driveway surrounded by the golf course. On arrival we easily found a parking space for the hire car and our bags were collected and taken to our room while we checked in. The hotel grounds and gardens are spectacular. As the name suggests the main hotel area with reception, dining and bar areas is a converted monastery- bright and clean with lots of character and beautifully renovated. The bedrooms are modern, large and comfortable with all the facilities you would expect - the bathrooms are especially large and well appointed ( we stayed in a superior room). Good quality towels etc. were changed whenever needed . High standard housekeeping.\nThe bar area is very relaxing and Giovanni and Salvo take a pride in serving high quality cocktails and helping in the choice of wines and local beers.\nWe stayed for 2 weeks, bed breakfast and evening meal. The choice available at breakfast was excellent. Elisa who supervises breakfast was really helpful and provided information for local places to visit.\nThe restaurant for evening meals is in a nice setting and the staff could not be more helpful. We were particularly well looked after by Luca, but all the staff and managers were great. Luca made our stay at the hotel really special - he is a great asset to the hotel. The standard menu has four choices for each course and there is an extra choice for each course that changes on a daily basis. The standard menu was also changed for our second week. We felt we always had something different to choose from. Some of the dishes were exceptionally good.\nWe are not golfers but my husband used the driving range quite a few times with clubs loaned to him from the golf reception and enjoyed it. The course looks good but we didn\u2019t use it.\nThe gym is quite small but adequate for a work out if you are that way inclined on holiday !\nOverall a relaxed, easy-going atmosphere at the hotel and a good location for sightseeing in the local area. We looked forward to getting back there on the days we ventured out and also enjoyed our days spent using the hotel facilities.","33425":"Everything about the hotel was amazing and we would definitely go back. The staff were all very professional and polite, the food was superb and very varied and the facilities were fantastic especially the pool area.\nThere are lots of beautiful towns to visit in the area such as Noto, Ragusa etc.and the nearby seaside resorts are beautiful with clean, warm sea!","33435":"This hotel felt like stepping back into a 70\u2019s summer camp!\n\nThere is no clear indication to where the hotel reception is as the main hotel area was blocked off for cars. The reception staff were very vague in giving us directions to where everything was. It would have been better if they had gotten off their chairs to show us around and to our room.\n\nWe booked a suite and the room was actually very nice and spacious.\n\nThe swimming pool area felt like we were at a 70\u2019s summer camp, it was all very old school. There is a little pool bar which sells crappy sandwiches and your drinks get bought over in a small plastic cup! Yes, my husband drank white wine from a plastic cup (the type of ones you drink tea from at a kid\u2019s football match!) But the girl from NYC was very friendly.\n\nWe went out in the evening but needed an iron for our clothes. They said they had an iron but couldn\u2019t send it up to the room for security reasons?? I went to the reception and she said there was a laundry type room across the other side of the hotel grounds where we could iron our clothes!!!! That meant we had to walk through reception, through the bar and games room, across the pool and bar area with our things that needed ironing. It was all a bit ridiculous!\n\nI asked what time breakfast and check out time etc was and she gave me a document that had all the timings on. FYI, they charge 3 euros if you use more than one beach towel- I have no idea how they would implement that.\n\nBreakfast was like a zoo. Crazy! And we waited ages for our table to be cleared so we could sit down and eat.\n\nThe room was very nice, but the rest of the hotel needs a facelift and they need to work on their service.\n\nWe will give this one a miss if we were to visit the area again.","33447":"Nice hotel! We are happy to come back to so wonderful place and meet again polite staff, especially Elisa. She gave us many pieces of advice at the first staying at the hotel. We thank her for discovering new beaches and baroque towns.","33459":"We stayed here for one night on our way to our holiday villa. Everyone made us so welcome and the service was excellent. Rooms in old building stunning and beautiful food at dinner and breakfast. Thank you to the whole team who clearly wanted to go the extra mile for us - we just wish we could have stayed longer! Cool bar area too with pool table and loads of space for privacy around the estate and by the pool. My husband had a massage which was excellent apparently.","33537":"we stayed in a BNB on the main street... it took a while to get settled.... then we moved to a larger suite with a plaster countertop.... the bus ride was memorable... or was it a train? glad I could still remember","33541":"We just visited this hotel spending 3 days with a group of 12 persons. The ppace is nice, clean, parking available with a large garden. The staff are very friendly. The rooms are very big including everything and a good variety of breakfast including english breakfast. Prices were quite affordable.","33543":"Hotel off the main street and calm. Personal and service very attentive, good breakfast choice! Good hotel and great value for money. Parking place and good outdoor pool, though did not really swim as weather was too cold.","33547":"We chose this hotel for its convenient location, nearness to the ruins, on-site parking, swimming pool, garden, elegance, and on-site restaurant. We had been travelling by car and this city would our third straight one-night stop. Our goal was to arrive early enough to relax and recover from several very busy days. For this, Parco Hotel Delle Fontane was perfect. A relaxing swim, a fine meal in an elegant setting, a walk about the dramatically lit garden, a nightcap, music, and even --perhaps -- some septuagenarian romance. Our attractive double had a fine bed, ample room, strong WiFi, and a great bath. Dinner (extra) and the free breakfast were excellent. Staff was professional and informative. They were quick and happy to tote our bags. It felt like a splurge. But at the Internet price it was a bargain. We thought about staying another night. Maybe next time. Greatest strengths: its overall atmosphere and the lovely pool.","33548":"This is a good hotel and the food is very good as well. It is on a busy street but does not affect the saty but one has to be careful walking to stores nearby. There is a grocery within a 8 minute walk","33551":"We stayed for two peaceful and relaxing nights at this hotel. The staff were wonderful. The breakfast was sumptuous and we could eat outside. The pool was a godsend. And the robes and slippers in the room were appreciated. This hotel is NOT near anything and not much is within walking distance. You should consider having a car. The hotel has parking. Driving to and parking in Ortigia (the old town), can be a challenge but we did okay. The archeological site is closer but still a few kilometers and it was hot in September so we drove there, too.","33560":"Hotel Parco delle Fontane - I simply can\u2019t get enough of this little piece of Heaven on Earth:heart:\nLeaving tomorrow after two wonderfull weeks at this very special hotel - BUT I DON\u2019T WANT TO! :see_no_evil:\nHere you find a true oasis in Syracuse. All you need for a relaxing, exclusive, peasefull stay is your swimsuit and lots of suncreme.:sunny::palm_tree:\nThanks to the allways maximum kind and very professionel staff for making our stay unforgettable, to the always hungry rooster in the park who gave us lots of laughs and to Emmanuele for dozens of pooltowels.\nWe give Parco delle Fontane :star:\ufe0f:star:\ufe0f:star:\ufe0f:star:\ufe0f:star:\ufe0f :heart:","33564":"Overall good, though room for improvement. The garden and pool area are just lovely and the breakfast was the best on our trip throughout Sicily! However the rooms are a bit outdated and could use a touch more of comfort. The location is not ideal, as there is nothing (sites, restaurants, etc) within walking distance. For us, for one night it was great but perhaps not for a longer stay.","33568":"It is a lovely hotel with advantages and disadvantages. I think tge price we paid fir our room was resonable. Breakfast was amazing. Pool is wowww. There were a member of staff at the pool every day having sunbathing, swimming and telling other member of the staff what to do. We found that extremely annoying. Seeing the lady enjoying the pool but other employees working hard in 35 Celsius degree. I think it is not appropriate and wasn't the only one who found that odd. The service from food and beverage staff was excellent. From reception... Uppon arrival we have been told that we don't have a reservation. Then suddenly they found it. No welcome drink been offered however they are advertising. The Aircon given up in our room but they kindly provided us an other room. We wanted to dine out but receptionist said there are no other restaurants walking distance. If you not fancy to dine at Eduardo there is an amazing pizzeria just 3min walk from the Hotel, called La artisti!!!! I loved that place. Amazing. Also if you don't want to spend all your money on taxi, what reception kindly book for you for \u20ac15-20 one way, there is a bus station nearby. You pay \u20ac1.20 for a DAY ticket. The journey takes abound 15 minutes on the bus if you take Bus23.\nOverall i recommended this hotel if you have a car. If you want to stay closer to ortigia then i wouldn't book it.","33570":"A delightful hotel with a beautiful, not busy pool. Breakfast is delicious and lunches on the verandah are a breath of fresh air. Rooms are lovely but it is the garden\/pool experience which sets it apart. We loved the weekly sicilian feast (30 euro pp without drinks). It was wonderful with delicious bbq prawns and so much choice. While it is only a few km away from the highlight of Ortigia, you need a taxi, which can be (20-35 euros return), depending on the hour. Antonio, front of house is charming. I would only come back to this hotel if i return to Syracuse as it was so peaceful.","33578":"the hotel is situated in a large garden. however, the parking is not so easy it would expect. We had dinner at the hotel which was neither bad nor very good. It is just average and rather on the high side. The room are okay and quite.","33579":"We were a group of ten and stayed just one night at this place though will definatley keep it mind when we next revist as it scored very well in all departments. Needless to say it had secure parking behind a gate (apart that the birds pooed on it :( - a lovely garden, rooms and bathroom were superior standard and more than adequate, whilst breakfast was yummy. Staff were all pleasant and helpful also and we have nothing to critisize or complain about.","33581":"We visited Syracusa on a Globus Esxapes off season bus tour. This hotel was an excellent choice with easy access for our coach to all the sights. The grounds are lovely but challenging parking for our coach driver. The inside corridors twist and turn a lot so some people on the coach tour got lost. Food was good and our room was very nice. Our window faced the garbage bins outside. I\u2019m not sure that I would choose this hotel if I was doing the driving or travelling in a manner other than the coach. Not sure where regular parking is and we did not try walking around the area.","33582":"This hotel was beautiful, not what you would expect for where it was situated. It was gorgeous on the inside and out. Staff very friendly and helpful. Our room was huge and bed very comfortable. Clean. Pool was lovely though a little cold when we went in May. Would definitely stay here again.","33595":"This was a very nice hotel. The rooms and the grounds are lovely .A caveat is that there is not much to do in walking distance. You will need a car or public transportation to get around. Also, we ate in the restaurant one night and there were mixed reviews from the six of us on the trip. We all agreed that the restaurant was a bit pricey. Go to Ortygia to find a nice place to eat.","33598":"We stayed here two nights while visiting Syracusa. The hotel clearly has the ambition of being at the upper end of the market and it could achieve this if and only if the management gets a better grip. The hotel is set in pleasant gardens well back from the road. The rooms are spacious and clean and would have been very comfortable but for the air conditioning not working. I called the front desk who sent the maintenance engineer. He felt the system was working fine and that we were not using it correctly. However, despite leaving it as he set it the temperature never got below 25C during two sweltering nights. We dined in the restaurant both nights. The food was good but the choice was very limited. The menu was the same on both nights and the same dishes were unavailable. Breakfast was excellent. Parking on site is free and secure. Wifi is good. This could be a really good hotel but currently it is poorly run. Management needs to pay attention to details and the staff need to be more responsive.","33599":"My partner and I stayed here for 6 nights a couple of weeks ago as part of our first holiday in Sicily and had a great time.\nThe room, staff and facilities were good and the gardens\/pool area are beautiful- a real oasis in the northern suburbs of Siracusa. The rooms don\u2019t have balconies but the terrace gardens and pool areas made up for not having private outdoor space.\nThe hotel was a sound base for exploring the city\u2019s attractions, Ortigia and surrounding area but you will probably struggle without a car as it\u2019s a fair way from the centre of the city and we didn\u2019t see much public transport- I assume that those without a car would have to rely on taxis... Most guests seemed to be driving though. It was lovely to return to the hotel pool and gardens after a day of sightseeing and there was plenty of parking under trees to help keep the hire car a bit cooler too. We loved the company of the hotel\u2019s pet cockerel whilst sunbathing- quite unique!!\nThere was a good selection at breakfast including a table of Sicilian dishes and most guests opted to eat outside. The restaurant in the evening is quite formal but the setting is lovely. We enjoyed eating there on our first night but as there was not much choice on the menu we found other local restaurants in walking distance and in Siracusa on the other nights of our stay.\nWe ate lunch by the pool one day and I can honestly say I had the most disappointing club sandwich of my life, it was quite amusing how poor it was, so much so I\u2019m sure it will become an anecdote for years to come! :-)\nThat said, we had a lovely time at the hotel and would not hesitate to recommend it to friends and maybe visit again in the future if we return to this area of Sicily.","33600":"My wife and I stayed here for 3 nights in June 2018. It was a delight with lovely gardens and a very nice pool. The breakfasts were good with a decent choice and the dinners we ate on each night were excellent. There was a good selection of wines and the prices were reasonable. The staff, both reception and in the bar and restaurant were very friendly and accommodating. They arranged taxis for us thus avoiding driving into the old town which, although a delight, is not for the faint hearted driver. All in all, highly recommended.","33617":"A lovely hotel in Syracuse. It is like an oasis in the city. It is near enough to all the attractions but whilst there you would think you were on a country estate. A beautiful converted villa in lovely gardens. The staff are very friendly and efficient.\nThe rooms are a good size and well equipped. Nice bathroom. We ate in the restaurant which is outside on a lovely terrace when the weather permits. The food was very good with a good choice and a decent wine list.\nBreakfast, also outside, was comprehensive.\nA beautiful,pool and plenty of sun beds to relax on.\nAn excellent choice for a long or short stay in Syracuse.","33618":"Fantastic hotel with very helpful staff.This hotel is an oasis on the outskirts of Syracuse which is surrounded by normal suburbia . Local restaurants are few and far between but you can fine dine at the hotel itself. The old part of the city is a taxi ride away and well worth a visit.","33624":"Ortygia is a lovely island and this bnb is the perfect place to stay. Location is great, nicely tucked in a quiet street just few mins walk from the Fontana do Diana. If you drive, it can be challenging to navigate into the small street so instead of turning into Via Della Giudecca, you could stop by the main road after turning from the fountain and walk about 50meters in.\n\nEvery room is different here. We were given a lovely duplex on the second floor with a stylishly designed bathroom. Our friend had a room on the third floor which was a little modest in size. Breakfast is great with fresh orange juice and a hearty spread of cheeses, hams, bread, pastries and cakes. Good selection of fruits too.","33627":"Just spent a night at this hotel and it was lovely. B&B in a perfect location, room was clean and spacious. The owners were professional and super accommodating. Only negative aspect was lack of a clear sign to find the hotel. Great breakfast! Overall great stay!","33628":"Friendly and helpful check in service. Nice breakfast with lots of options. Public parking is close, but easy to walk to everything. Executive double room was like a small apartment, clean, modern furnishings, comfortable and quiet.","33630":"We stayed here for three nights and were really pleased with our room. We were in an Executive Double Room, which was spacious and clean; the bed was very comfortable. As well as the double bedroom, there was a small single bedroom (which contained the wardrobe), a sitting area and a kitchenette (which we didn\u2019t use, as it was not part of our package). All the staff we met were very friendly and helpful and a good breakfast was provided. The rooms are upstairs and there isn\u2019t a lift but the staff willingly helped with the luggage. The B&B is in a good, quiet location. The B&B arranged our transfers to and from Ortigia, making for a convenient arrival and departure. If returning to Ortigia, we would certainly use this B&B again. A very good ristorante is \u2018Moon\u2019; a vegan establishment. We are not vegan but we enjoyed our meal so much, we returned for dinner on another night; the staff very friendly and welcoming. Hint: it is a good idea to book.","33634":"We enjoyed our stay here. Breakfast was good . The apartment was clean and fairly spacious. My only complaint would be that they need to brush up on the little things , such as supplying one bottle of water for 2 people and this is the only B and B that does not supply tea and coffee making facilities. Also our friends stayed in the apartment next to ours that although it was equipped with a kitchen there were no glasses or any kitchen equipment at all .","33635":"In spite of the SatNav we nearly drove past as the road is so narrow you are concentrating on the driving and not the buildings - go slow and ignore everyone around you and get ready to pull over quickly when you see the church. The reception staff were very welcoming and quickly brought our cases in and to the room whilst we moved the car - the initial impression was light and bright, very clean and fresh. Our room with sea view was actually an apartment, was larger than we expected and most attractive. The sea view was from a good sized terrace and was really glimpses through and over the roof tops - charming and interesting. (very hot). The bathroom was modern but did need some TLC and possibly also a clothes horse to go on the terrace as our towels were not drying between use. The breakfast room was small but again light and bright and very attractively presented with pristine tables and cloths and there was a good selection of both savoury and sweet - there could be serious weight gain, limited my partner to one per day as his eyes lit up every morning. Coffee was also good. The B&B was in an excellent position for walking around the island but also the Giudecca area has an interesting history of its own, some of which starts under the church next door. Recommended.","33643":"What\u2019s not to like? Perfect location within easy walking distance of all the sights; pleasant room with large, comfortable bed; excellent breakfast; friendly staff; very attractive communal areas; quiet location. It\u2019s a bit of a hassle having to pay in cash in this day and age but we were prepared. Would highly recommend.","33644":"I really liked this place. Very helpful and friendly with a really good sized room and bathroom. An excellent location for wandering out to the sights but away from the main thoroughfares so pretty quiet.\nThe downside was the slightly limited breakfast (especially if, like me, you are a vegetarian without a sweet tooth) and the room needed a coat of paint.","33645":"Such a delightful conversion of what must have been a substantial 16th or 7th century house!\n\nWe were allocated a small apartment, beautifully finished on the ground floor. A small problem with parking was swiftly resolved and we spent a wonderful day going around Siracusa. Hotel is very central and great as a base.to tour this marvellous city! Good quality linen and the thick walls ensure no modern noise intrudes in the room.\n\nBreakfast was substantial with a wide range of cold cuts, cheese as well as pastries and some cooked items. Excellent value for money - kindly note that they only accept cash for settling of bills. I don't know if this was because of the banks or because the owners felt that this was a better method, but it's good one knows! Will definitely be back","33646":"Situated in he historic and characterful old Jewish quarter, this is a little gem of a place! We were lucky bough to book one of the suites with balcony, so enjoyed the sunny, breezy sea view, as well as very spacious and comfortable accommodation for a B&B!\nBreakfast as great, and most of the staff were polite and helpful.","33647":"We were assigned room 12 on the top floor, but we don't mind the steps. Actually, no one over your head is a plus. It is an apartment (living room, large room with big big bed, nice bathroom, kitchen, fridge, small terrasse with table and chairs and rooftop terrasse offering beautiful view), but we had booked a standard room. A present from the owner because we booked directly, and it was not high season yet. She asked us not to use the kitchen which is understandable since we had not requested this service nor were we willing to pay extra for that, not with all the great restaurants offering delicious typical Sicilian food to be found in Ortigia. And who wants to cook on vacation, not me! The room was very clean when we arrived, daily cleaning as well. We spent 3 nights there, and it was a great beginning for our 19 nights trip to Sicily. Breakfast served by friendly and efficient employees, plenty of choice, good coffee. We parked the rental car 2 times at the Telate parking lot (10 euros for 24 hours, 10 minutes walk at a slow pace) and once got lucky and found a free parking place. Stefania, the owner, her sister Daniela and brother Johnny were the first contact we had with the people of Sicily, which are so friendly, helpful and sweet. We ate at Stefania's' husband's restaurant once, Peperoso, very good. The B&B is super well located. We hope to go back to Sicily and will definitely stay at the Via della Giudecca again.","33648":"This is an excellent place with great staff and food. We had asked for a ground floor room which saved on stairs, and had the advantage of a small courtyard outside for smoking. Just a short stroll through charming narrow alleys to the Duomo with some great restaurants en route. We were very happy here, and it was a great base for seeing the town","33649":"The location in the old Jewish ghetto. The room no 13 has a wonderfull terrace with sea view. The downsides are: you need a help with your luggage to get up to the appartment, if you have more than a hand luggage. We were advised not to use the kitchen, it is only furnished, but our of service! The people are very friendly but Italian-speaking only. If you have some special requirements it is complicated to explain.","33650":"I can only echo what others have said about room 11 (a \u2018double room with sea view\u2019). It Is on the top floor (there is someone to help with your bags). A first glance the room is fine - it is a small apartment really with kitchen, living room, double bedroom, and a lovely terrace with sea view. On closer inspection; however, it is a bit dingy. It needs a paint job, the kitchen has a small refrigerator but no electric kettle or other useful items, the bathroom is one of the smallest I have ever had (the toilet seat nearly touches the shower doors!) I did not get a chance to see any of the other rooms, but if they are anything like this then the photos on the website are deceiving.\n\nThat all said, the people are lovely and helpful. Breakfast was very nice. The location is perfect.","33656":"A perfect location in the centre of Siracusa......such a treat! A beautiful via to the main Piazza from here and delightful small shops nearby. Warm welcome and thoughtful service. The breakfasts are the best! Fresh local cheeses, ham and sausage, exquisite Sicilian cakes and cornetto, rolls, fresh fruit and good coffeee in a lovely breakfast room. Highly recommend!","33657":"The hotel is perfectly located in the old Jewish section. It is central to all of the main sites. We drove in. It is easy to drive to there and drop off our bags. They then directed us to public parking which was 15 minutes (by foot) away. The parking rate is 10 euros a day. We booked one of the better rooms with private balcony and city view. The view was as promised; but we were given room 11; which clearly has not been renovated and was nothing like the photos. For the next night they moved us to room 13 which was much nicer and much more what we expected. We realize each room is a bit different and photos might not exactly match; but room 11 is totally run down and nothing like any of the photos. This was very disappointing. The breakfast room is a bit claustrophobic. The staff was super friendly and provide maps and recommendations.","33662":"I enjoyed my stay here - the location was perfect and the staff was very good. Nice cleanrooms with modern baths and very nice breakfast. I recommend it!\nWhat I wasn\u2019t aware of before my stay and I think other travelers may like to know that it is difficult driving in this area and you must find parking at another location. So you have to be able to carry your bags in and out from where ever you manage to find parking.\nAlso there is not an elevator. The hotel is three floors high with circling marble steps. For anyone who has difficulty climbing steps this would definitely be a problem. I watched many older patrons including my husband have difficulty navigating these steps.","33663":"We had a wonderful three night stay here. I'd really call it a hotel more than a B+B, although it has no bar or dining room. Breakfast was simple but very enjoyable. The family who run it are very friendly and helpful. We had a fantastic room on the top floor, with a lovely terrace overlooking the rooftops and out to the sea. Very comfortable bed. The hotel location is perfect, right in the middle of Ortigia. Highly recommended!","33664":"Well situated, calm and confortable. The breakfast is a very nice buffet with everything you could ask for.\nThere could be some improvements by replacing some worn furniture in room 5. I don't know about the other ones but it's not a big deal.\n\nThe biggest problem is finding the actual place. The B&B in not in front of the San Philipo church but on its right side when facing the church. You can use the car to drop off your luggage on San Philipo Piazza, then figure out which building is the B&B. Don't just stall the car looking around cause you will block the very thight Via. The walking distance from parkings is about 10 minutes.\n\nKnowledgable staff available from 7 am to 7 pm.","33665":"We spent 3 nights here recently. The rooms were clean, comfortable and the breakfast very fresh. This is a little hard to find as Ortigia is a wonderful location but very narrow streets. The staff was very friendly. Parking can be a chore however we found spots daily. We would go back. Keep in mind this is a cash only stay and they do not take credit cards.","33667":"We arrived for 2 nights at this hotel and were offered room no 2, ground floor. The apartment had a bedroom with a comfortable bed, a rather small but fully equipped bathroom and a kitchen. Everything was clean and nice.We had a great time there, plus the owner presented us for breakfast some delicious cheeses along with homemade desserts, which actually stole the show! Cannoli, fruit tart, brioches, but also prosciutto crudo and prosciutto cotto, and other home made delights. The staff was very helpful and always with a smile. I warmly recommend this place in Syracuse!","33676":"Look no further! I loved staying at B and B La Via della Giudecca! Well-run, clean, spacious rooms, comfortable beds, gracious host (Gianni, or maybe Johnny, is fun, charming and professional - thank you!!), great location and gorgeous, fresh, amazing breakfast with excellent coffee, cheeses, pastries, eggs and various selection of quality! I absolutely adored this hotel and loved coming back each night or whenever we needed a rest.\nFirst class and well run, this is the type of hotel that makes a vacation even better than what it should be!\nThank you!!","33679":"Overall we were pleased with our 3 night stay in a 3 room apartment with a small kitchen. But the kitchen is just a sink and small refrigerator. No utensils, cutlery, no plates, glasses, nothing. Pretty useless, not even tea or coffee making facility. That was the disappointment. The annoyance was that no credit cards are accepted, only cash. Come on, its 2018..\n\nBut none the less, the location is very good, and its clean, and reasonably priced for Ortiga Island. Best parking is really in the covered car park on the north east edge of the island. It's only a 10 minute walk from there.","33683":"We drove here from Catania. The town is a challenging drive but once at the hotel, it is relaxing and well situated. The peninsula is small enough to walk so we parked the car and didn\u2019t use for our stay.\n\nThe rooms could do with a repaint, but were spacious. It was slightly overpriced but the location could be reason why.","33696":"Excellent value for money, really great location in the middle of Ortigia. Staff were very friendly, and our room was very large (separate bedroom and living room). Breakfast was also a pleasant surprise as other (more expensive) hotels we\u2019d stayed at had a poorer selection of cheeses and breads. Note that payments have to be made in cash, there seemed to only be one ATM associated with a bank (rather than the ATMs that charge high fees) on the island, about 5-7 mins walk away.","33700":"We arrived at the hotel alongside 2 other couples, it took over 30 min to be acknowledged and showed to our rooms, unwanted upgrade to a suite with an enclosed kitchen advising cannot be used unless asked for permission. The sofa covers (initially white in colour) were now embedded in cigarette smoke and stained, absolutely disgusting! The bathroom could use a clean up as the ventilation is non existent and the pipes are emanating a foul odour. We had access to the terrace which had the view of the buildings surrounding us and had to pay cash only at check out. The breakfast was alright but they do not throw away the leftovers from the previous day as I've noticed traces of tomato seeds on slices of cheese and the tomatoes were served intact, you draw your conclusion from here. The lady at the desk was somewhat helpful but at some point during our chat to her, the business phone rang, the customer was put on speaker making us unwanted witnesses to a conversation, the gentleman was inquiring on parking on the premises or on surrounding areas and the lady at the desk did nothing but mocking and being evasive in her reply to him. My partner and I was embarrassed and believe the lack of interest she showed us on the phone a few hours earlier when we called to say we were running late as we were slightly behind schedule in our trip, must have treated with the same ignorance and lack of manners. I wouldn't return there, it was by far the worst of the many B&B's we've stayed in over the last 12 months. The location is fine, however not much to do in Ortigia, so, in hindsight, more in Taormina, less in Syracuse.","33701":"Stayed for two nights in July 2020 on a tour of Sicily. Staff spoke good English and were reasonably helpful. Bed was comfortable. Hotel has a faded grandeur about it, though needs some TLC to bring it back to its former glory. It is within walking distance of the archeological park (about 15 - 20 mins). However, food options are limited. The evening meal menu had only two choices and breakfast was poor - basically a croissant and some museli. It is a very long walk to get to Ortigia and there appeared to be no local trattorias close to the hotel. In fact the surrounding area is not very nice at all - there was lots of litter and a dead cat just outside. Whilst this is not the hotel's fault\/responsibility, it doesn't create a good impression. We drove the 5 - 10 mins to get to Ortigia which does have a nice old town with plenty of restaurants. The room room was very small and smelt very musty\/damp with a very noisy air conditioning unit. No help provided with luggage. Disappointing as there were very few visitors. Carpets in main lobby\/stair area were dirty. Parking is available but not guarded. Would not recommend. Considered leaving after the first night, but had made plans and didn't want to drive to our next stop late at night.","33703":"The hotel is located right in front of an ancient stone pit (Greek time), which makes the whole atmosphere very exotic. The hotel was built in 1862 and the dining hall and entrance hall are particularly beautiful. We had our room on the top floor, from where we enjoyed the sunrise over the sea every morning. The employees were all kind and helpful. The dinner at the restaurant was good and surprisingly reasonable. The only drawback would be the fact that the hotel is far from the old town. We went to the old part \u201cOrtiga\u201d on foot and it took about 30 minutes.","33705":"Two years ago while on a summer road trip around Sicily, we had booked in this hotel. Because of our positive experience then, we decided to come back during a winter break. The hotel didn\u2019t disappoint. The staff were friendly & accommodating. My sister initially was assigned a room that smelled of cigarettes. When we alerted the staff, they promptly changed her room & even upgraded her booking at no extra cost. The decor is a bit dated with the beds being a bit too firm. It is always clean, however, and would surely come back when the opportunity arises. Great service as always!","33707":"Class, history, friendly staff, good beds, ample breakfast buffet: all of this results in an enjoyable stay.\nIn summer the pool is an additional asset.\nNot in old part of town but sufficiently close, perhaps 30 min walking distance.","33709":"We booked a half board offer with love holidays knowing it was the end of the season but the weather is still 23degrees so we were happy at first This is definitely not a place to stay for 2 weeks. We were the only british couple that we could see It was so dead. It is a long way to walk the lovely island area so because we were half board we planned to stay in on a night BUT The bar was open from about 6.30pm until the dining staff left at about 10pm if you could manage to catch someone to serve you ! We were bored stiff on a night. No one to talk to. No entertainment Bar closed .No british tv.\nDefinitely caters for the Italians of which large parties were in the other part of the dining getting all the attention while the 2 tables in the other part of the dining room (separated off) had to wait. After they had eaten they just vanished to there rooms. We saw various people go to the bar and go cos no one there to serve.\nThe pool was freezing and the access to the sea was closed as end of season.\nA small bus runs down to the town just had to stand and wait till one turned up 1 euro each good value. The small island over the bridge is lovely but 1 week at most is all you need to see it.\nOur room appeared clean but by the time we left I was bitten all over arms stomach and legs ! I showed a lady and had an apology but I would Avoid room 211\nIt looks so appealing on the photos but we were very disappointed with both the position of the hotel and with love holidays for offering this as a destination for 2 weeks. Only good thing was we were given a taxi transfer there and back as we were the only idiots to go there.\nSicily is defo a place to go but tour round dont stay.","33710":"Unfortunately we stayed here only one night. The inside of the hotel is beautiful, so \u201cold fashioned\u201d in a good way. The dining area with the high ceilings and chandeliers is magnificent. The rooms are very comfortable and very clean. The outside garden areas are very nice, especially the one that was an old quarry.","33715":"As part of a group tour, we spent two nights at this beautiful hotel. Well maintained, comfortable beds and very clean, it also offered historical overtones and amazing views! I enjoyed the large pool (unheated) and deck area. The view of an ancient Roman quarry from my room (directly below my window) was peaceful. The hotel offered a nice breakfast buffet of sweetbreads, fruits and coffees. Our dinner was excellent and worth \u201cstaying in\u201d for.","33717":"We have just returned from a week at this amazing hotel, full of character, history and Old World charm.\nOur room overlooked the gardens, with the sea in the distance. It was nicely furnished, clean and comfortable. Lovely toiletries and fluffy towels are included in all rooms. The balcony\u2019s are the French type, narrow and not meant for lounging, as was the style when the hotel was built, but a few rooms have a furnished terrace.\nThe public rooms and the gardens are beautiful, very comfortable and interesting. Free Wifi throughout was very useful. There is a large pool and plenty of sun beds. Pool towels are supplied for a small charge.\nThere is a bus stop outside the hotel with a bus to the main sites and Ortigia (1e per person) but we found the service a bit hit and miss out of season. The walk into Ortigia takes around 20 minutes, and the Greek Theatre and other tourist sites are walkable in about the same time, or there is the \u2018hop on hop off\u2019 bus which also stops near the hotel (5e per person)\nThe restaurant is wonderful, breakfast is excellent, and dinner in the evening was fresh and beautifully cooked. We do not much care for fish, which features heavily in this area, but we were offered very good alternatives and enjoyed every meal along with the good selection of wines. Service in the restaurant is superb, and we would like especially to thank Ava, who looked after us very well in a friendly and professional manner, and also the lady who serviced our room so nicely every day.\nWe would love to return again as soon as we can and would recommend this amazing hotel without reservation.","33723":"Loved this hotel! The views were amazing and the grounds more so! It has a quarry! Beautifully furnished and excellent staff! Lovely quote by Winston Churchill is on the door from when he stayed there.","33724":"This is an incredible dive in a world of luxury and elegance one thought was only the realm of movies like \u201cIl gattopardo\u201d, but it isn\u2019t. It is very real and just a short pleasant seaside walk to the most beautiful town in Sicily: Ortigia. Winston Churchill said his night here was the best rest he ever had, and it\u2019s no wonder. Maybe the younger crowd will not catch the charm, but they will eventually come to appreciate how special places like this hotel are, in time. A must.","33725":"I would definitely recommend this hotel but a few minor changes would give this hotel the edge.\nWe stayed for 7 days in September.\nChange the line green walls in the hotel.\nMake the pool area more attractive by having more chairs and tables. A better menu. Better choice of drinks. Wine not just Prosecco.\nTurn the radio off.\nThe pool lad to smile.\nOutside the main entrance there is a lovely seating to have a drink. This is normally taken up by smokers and is quite unpleasant for non smokers. Move the smokers around the corner.\nAlso there is a lovely circled patio area. The chairs and umbrellas are left in a mess. Open this area up it is lovely.\nHave a brush around the exterior of the hotel. There is some grubby areas.\nPut a bench at the taxi pick up area.\nImprove the bar service. There is generally no one there. The dirty glasses aren\u2019t picked up until the next morning.\nThe breakfast is just right.\nWe used the lido once and then it closed! It was super there.\nDon\u2019t charge for pool towels.\nOur suite was lovely, but did have some tired areas.\nThe hotel is a good 30 minute walk to the island and a busy walk. Staci was between 10 and 14 euros.","33729":"Wish I could have given this hotel a 5 ,,but the breakfast really let it down. When you first see this hotel ,,it looks like something from over 100 years ago ( which of course it is) . Beautiful setting,, great gardens and the best deck chairs by a very good pool. I was in a single room ,so didn\u2019t have a balcony. The real fault was in the bathroom,, not a shelf to put anything on. But very comfortable bed ,wonderful pillows ,,so great nights sleep. I was there for 7 nights . Each evening they did a happy hour,, a choice of cocktails ( all excellent) and canap\u00e9s. For \u20ac7 this was great value. Also their house wine at \u20ac5 is wonderful. We did have dinner one evening,, great service,,food was ok. If you are thinking of a visit to Syracuse,,please try this hotel. Well worth a visit . Just a shame the breakfast let it down. But a Hugh \u201cThank you \u201c to the staff.","33730":"This is a very traditional hotel with a good deal of history which is interesting in itself. The restaurant was good and informal. Breakfast was terrific with a wide range of choice including perhaps the most delicious chocolate croissants ever! Our room was very comfortable with efficient air-conditioning which was needed due to the very hot and humid weather during our stay.\nThe location is relatively quiet for Siracuse, being a ten minute walk from the city centre. There is a lot of guest parking which makes it very convenient if you arrive by car.\nShould we return to Siracusa we would definitely stay here again","33734":"Really nice 3 night stay at this Character hotel about 2 miles outside Ortigia. This hotel is like stepping back in time with its grand entrance, chandeliers and grand ballroom.\nAll positive comments. Staff were really friendly and helpful, easy check in. The room was large with a comfy bed, safe, mini bar, good air con. The bathroom was ok, had a bath shower, water did go everywhere from shower because of the small glass screen but not a big deal. The pool was lovely and clean, lots of sun beds and pool bar for food and drink. The breakfast room is like a big old ballroom with chandeliers and huge round tables. Breakfast was buffet style, not amazing but has something for everyone. Lots of free car parking too on site.\nIt is about a half hour walk to Ortigia but plenty of other sites within walking distance around Syracuse and the beach. All in all a lovely stay at the Grand Hotel Villa Politi and would definitely recommend. :hugs:","33735":"Winston Churchill said he had his best sleep ever at GHVP. And the same pillow is on offer. Once the extra fold bed was removed from our room, it was spacious. Service was excellent, the pool lovely, the food and wine beautiful. Loved our stay in Siracusa.","33737":"From the imposing arrival up the sweeping curved staircases into the foyer and the reception room beyond, this hotel evokes memories of mid-twentieth glamour. The lovely breakfast\/dining room, clear pool and historic legacy of the grounds make this a perfect place to take pre-dinner drinks on the veranda, and relax in the very comfortable bedrooms. It's a jewel, and will definitely plan to come back. Avoid the chains, and try this hotel - you cannot be disappointed.","33738":"This is our second visit to the Grand Hotel Politi, this year we booked directly with the hotel as our last trip was three years ago and we got engaged in the piazza .....this year we requested the same room as it was our honeymoon (Hooray ...fireworks) etc ... We received a conformation email that we had the same room very special to us , but on arrival at the hotel we were given another room at first I was upset and quite angry as it was a special trip for us ....so we went along with the key to see the room that they had given us and well what an I say the Hotel Politi pulled it out of the bag again and gave us the presidential Suite .\nThis Hotel makes everything Happen there Great, Highly recommend again.","33739":"Spent four nights here this August and was pleasantly surprised. Location was beautiful and peaceful apart from one night when a band was playing in the nearby square for the Italian August holidays but this is to be expected if you holiday in Sicily in the last two weeks of August some shops and restaurants were also closed because of this.\n\nThe hotel advertised the use of a Lido\/beach area but be prepared to pay for this and access to the sea itself was tricky having to climb down onto rocks and into the sea so if you have any mobility issues it may not be possible.\n\nThe hotel was about 30 minute walk into the beautiful old town of Ortigia with many many restaurants, bars and shops or a 5\/10 minute taxi ride costing around 10.00 euro each way. A hop on hop off bus also operates into the old town and surrounding sights with bus stop close to the hotel. We did find a couple of restaurants within easy strolling distance which served very good food with terraced areas looking out to sea. We chose to spend two of the four nights in the old town so didn't explore local amenities .\n\nThe hotel pool was perfect for a relaxing after noon after a busy morning sight seeing. Be prepared to pay 2.50 euro\/day for pool towels or bring your own.\n\nIf you plan to spend a lot of time in the old town then this hotel may be a little out of the way but on the other hand you are rewarded with a tranquil, peaceful and historical setting to retreat to after a busy day or evening.","33743":"Staff and friendly and helpful.\n\nLocation is not great if the old town of Siracusa is where you will be spending most of your time. It's a 30 min walk or easy taxi (electric bus is very unreliable). There is a stop for the sighting-seeing bus nearby which is better and runs all day. Also has gps location so you can see online where the buses are.\n\nHowever, the hotel boasts an excellent pool which will keep the kids happy and is why we chose it.\n\nPlenty of free parking on-site if you are coming by car, easy to find off the autostrada.\n\nThe ruins and front part of the hotel give it a glamorous charm from a bygone age.\n\nHowever, the decor is a bit unusual in the new part of the hotel, red carpet with lime green walls! Rooms are fine though panels on bath could be bigger to avoid drenching the whole bathroom when taking a shower.\n\nA few small things that let the hotel in comparison with others we stayed in on Sicily:\n\nNo fresh fruit juice at breakfast and had a coffee machine. Breakfast was also a bit crowded at times as people around the serving areas. Fruit salad very poor - not fresh, but pastries very good.\n\nPool is great, however, there is a 2.50 euro charge per pool towel, again not something we came across elsewhere.\n\nOverall, if you need a pool then this is a good bet but if it's just a sightseeing visit, you might be better off in or nearer the old town.","33747":"We spent 6 nights here and had a lovely time. While this hotel may be lacking in some areas, I feel there is far more good to outweigh any bad.\n\nLet's start with the not so good:\n- the place is a bit rundown. Carpets need a good Hoover, handrails on stairways could do with a tighten and the coffee machines in the breakfast room desperately need replacing.\n- the charge of 2 Euros\/day for towel usage. We discovered that the majority of travelers brought or bought their own towels to use throughout their stay, so we did the same.\n- lunch options are very limited. (We didn't eat dinner there)\n- pillows SUCKED! They were flat and hard.\n\nNow, for the good:\n- Location. It sits atop an old Roman (or was it Greek) quarry overlooking the sea. The views are spectacular and it's walking distance (30 min) to Ortigia.\n\n- Staff are multilingual and very nice. Upon check in the receptionist, Paola, upgraded us to a Seaview room with balcony. She and her colleague, Ramona, spent the rest of the week answering all our questions, helping with taxis, and giving us as much assistance as we needed. Truly, the entire staff were extremely nice and made our stay very enjoyable.\n\n- the beds, bath and towels - comfortable, large and plentiful!\n\n- breakfast was delicious. The fresh bread was so popular people would stalk the server awaiting the next loaf.\n\n- free parking!\n\nAlthough a bit faded, it's still a wonderful place to spend a week. I definitely recommend.","33748":"When we first pulled up to the hotel, it looked run down and I was dubious. The lobby was beautiful in an old fashioned way ad then we went to the room which was very old looking. It wasn't until I had been there a day that I realized what they were doing and it occurred to me as I ate breakfast in this beautiful dining room that looked like a ballroom from an old movie. This hotel was an estate built in 1862 that they are trying to keep in its original condition. All that being said, the bed was comfortable, the breakfast was excellent, the air conditioning was very good and everything was very clean. Ut was also conveniently located to the Hop On Hop Off bus. I was glad we ended up in this hotel.","33751":"Stayed just for one night as we had a rental car and it\u2019s difficult to stay in the Old town Ortigia with a car. The hotel is old and like most old things in Italy they get left alone. The pool area is great except the beers and soft drinks were quite warm out of the fridge. The outside of the hotel at the rear has been recently painted and repaired this also needs to be done at the front. There\u2019s plenty of free off street parking in the hotel grounds. Our room was typical size for Italy very small bathroom and extremely small shower. The bed was two single mattresses pushed together that were quite uncomfortable probably due to age. There were also only two pillows supplied and no additional sun the wardrobe. Our refrigerator was broken (not cooling) so a replacement was bought up within 10 mins and a bag of ice which was much appreciated. Breakfast was included in our rate which was plentiful and choices varied although the scrambled eggs were stone cold at 8am. The staff at breakfast were very helpful and friendly. I didn\u2019t like how the front desk kept our passports until we checked out, every other hotel in this trip (7 including this hotel) and other European trips recently has either copied or scanned our passports and given them back to us in the check-in process. The hotel is a good 30min walk to the old city which is where all the action happens, that part of town is sensational let me tell you so much to see and do, eat drink shop listen to music etc. A taxi is \u20ac10 each way well worth it at midnight.","33752":"The location is good in Siracusa. But it is a 30-40 mns walk to Ortigia were most restaurants, shops and nice areas are. The staff is very service minded! Good breakfast buffet with a lot of nice stuff to choose from. The pool area is really nice, but towels costs extra, \u20ac2,50. If one want to stay at a classical hotel, Villa Politi is a good choice. Free parking at the hotel!","33753":"We had a fabulous 2 night stay at this superb distinctive hotel. The location is unique as it stands overlooking the famous ancient quarry. We had a beautiful front room overlooking this site with views extending to the sea. The room was spacious and very comfortable with two balconies. The hotel is very comfortable with a lovely terrace for evening cocktails served with wonderful nibbles. The breakfast was good but surprisingly no fresh orange juice. The food in the restaurant was delicious and is a must visit. The swimming pool area is excellent. The staff throughout the hotel were very helpful. The hotel is 10 minutes by bus or taxi from stunning Ortygia. It is the same distance to the bus and train station with a taxi costing up to 15 euros. Great value for this quality. Highly Recommended.","33754":"The Grand Villa Politi is like an old lady creaking in her stays. She is held together by a passionate and dedicated team of staff.\nRoberto, Christiano and Paola, dealt with our issues promptly and respectfully. The grand lady is arguably like a curate's egg. She retains enough of her esteemable past, to provide a unique eccentric base, to explore the wonderful Siracusa, Ortigia and surrounds","33760":"Christiano deserves all the credit that he gets. From our arrival until when we left he was full of joy and fabulous conversation.\nAll the other staff we came across were friendly always greeting us as they went past.\nWe are a young (ish) couple and had the best time during our stay.\nThe hotel is spotlessly clean and the breakfast plentiful, who doesn't like prosecco for breakfast!\nThe rooms have lovely sea facing balconies and are well maintained, if maybe a little dated. However this only ads to their charm.\nA top tip is the restaurant just over the road from the hotel, the best antipasti that's free if you buy an alcoholic drink.\nWe will definitely be back if were ever in Sicily again :clinking_glasses:","33763":"Four nights in stylish hotel, a little faded but with class and old aristocratic atmosphere. Stayed in a superior room with terrace and nice park & sea views. Elegant interior and d\u00e9cor, clean, functional, very comfy beds. Modern bathroom. A rubber mat in the bathtub should be added for safety reasons. Nice and clean pool area, quiet and relaxing. Service minded staff all over the place. Breakfast served in the stylish and nicely decorated restaurant. Quality and choice not the level expected.\n\nThe hotel is surrounded by the fascinating Latomia park which was unfortunately closed indefinitely. Access to the park seems to be managed by the city government in a very strange and secret manner. What a pity as this fabulous park would add an extra magic dimension to visiting Villa Politi.\n\n5 min walk to the beach with a couple of restaurants and a long walking\/bicycle path along the coast with great sea views. Frequent minibuses (3 times\/hr) with stop outside the hotel takes you to Ortigia in 20 min, walking is 30 min. Red buses 5 \u20ac\/day, grey buses 2 \u20ac\/day. The latter runs later but can a bit uncomfortable.","33768":"Stayed here for 4 nights. Deliberately chosen to be out of the main tourist area and closer to the Neopolis and because there is parking. The hotel was obviously once very grand and this has faded a little but it is still lovely. You are right on top of the Latomie Cappucini which gives the gardens and outside space an evocative feel. All the staff were friendly and helpful; everyone greeted you as you walked past.\n\nWe had a room on the first floor opening out onto a large shared balcony. The room was well furnished, comfortable and clean. Breakfast required a bit of getting the hang of. There was a lot of fairly standard fare available from the buffet but the trick was to order coffee and eggs from the staff. Apparently, the coffee was a lot better than that from the machine and, obviously the eggs were fresher. The fruit options were disappointing in that they were all tinned and therefore in syrup. Some fresh fruit salad would have been nice. I liked the idea of the grill to warm the pancakes and bread if you wanted it.\n\nWe never tried the dinner as there was only a set menu and none of the options appealed. The happy hour was fun and the appetizers appreciated.\n\nAs has been mentioned previously, this hotel gets a lot of coach tours stopping here for a night or two on their tours round Sicily. I suspect this has made it less necessary to be inventive as most clients are there for a limited time.","33770":"Front desk: very welcoming, friendly and professional staff. Room: good location, good size, quite large. However furniture is shopworn, tired. Bathroom somewhat less so. This 19th century hotel has been tricked up as grand hotel in scale yet its style is a mixture of what Italians call 'liberty' (after the UK dept. store)or beaux arts and let's just say Sicilian 1970s taste. Amenities are minimal. Breakfast: included in price and perhaps that's why the quality was lacking -excluding scrambled eggs which were made fresh and hot , repeatedy. Breakfast was really was not up to par for that standard of hotel- missing was real (not diet) yogurt, good quality honey, decent cereal , smoked fish of some sort, real croissants not the industrially filled ones, for example. But they do have plenty of bacon which I presume is to please American tourists primarily. Also utterly lacking are local breakfast pastries with signs in English to encourage trial rather than just eat what they already familiar with. In any case restaurnat staff if polite and very professional Dinner: I didn't eat in the restaurant for dinner as the menu was a deterrent - a plain pasta alla norma variant or a vegetable soup as starters- really designed for people who don't want to eat out. The hotel restaurant is not a destination.Hotel infrastructure: beautiful pool with water that has been properly maintained\/chlorinated. DIning room is vast and has a smaller side room for breakfast and maybe dinner. Outdoor garden has some beautiful plants but rather poxy cheapo sculpture with water fountainin the very front. Hotel location is removed from the ugly part of downtown. However it is not in the best neighborhood as it is close to council type\/projects housing. It is unique in that it sits literally on top of the Latomia but the city museums arbitrarily and surreptitiously decides when to open and close the Latomia Capuccini so don't choose that location if that's the reason you're there (as I did). It is also walking distance - about 3 km from the amphitheatre. Hotel's target audience: older demographic, a few large busses full of tourists some of whom looked quite inappropriately dressed for a resort, who don't realize they're in a city not a beachfront despite being on an island (but so is Manhattan) others still who had this Ambien-Prozac look nevertheless all nice,well behaved guests.","33774":"Lovely hotel. Nice room. No tea and coffee facilities in room. No a la carte dinner menu and minimal breakfast selection for hot dishes.\nOtherwise pleasant obliging staff and lots of history including some fantastic pictures on the walls","33780":"We had a wonderful stay at the Grand Hotel Ortigia. This is a classic hotel with lovely ambiance and loaded with charm. The staff were all friendly and helpful and the rooms very clean. It was a nice touch to have the mats placed next to your bed and the drapes drawn when you returned to the room each night. Breakfast was wonderful and plentiful and the view was spectacular. It was very convenient to have parking directly across the street and to be right on the edge of the lovely town center. Highly recommend","33786":"We stayed in the Grand Hotel at the end of August 2019 for two nights and we would highly recommend it. We managed to get a good deal on a lovely room which had our bed on a mezzanine. It was hot in Siracusa when we were there and the aircon in the room was welcome and worked well. The room was large and had a living room area, the bed was large and very comfortable. Breakfast in the hotel is expensive but it is worth having one during your stay as it is served on the roof and the view is wonderful, alternatively you could have a drink up there in the evening. The staff were all very polite and professional, service is \"old school\" and catered towards our North American friends, in fact we felt very young as the age profile of the guests was on the high side! Many seemed to be visiting \"their roots\" in Sicily.\nThe hotel has a private beach which is across the bay, the hotel has a boat shuttle service which you can book at the front desk, there are sunbeds, umbrellas and a little cafe for sandwiches, drinks and ice creams at the beach.\nIf you are looking for a party spot this is not the hotel for you, it is quiet, but if you want a central location with old world charm, excellent service and comfort, stay here. I can't fault this hotel, we would love to return.","33789":"This Hotel has the best location in town , 2 days Max , not longer than that , rooms are great , this hotel is a traditional place , recommended for a quick visit in Siracusa\n\nThe Restaurant located on the top part , provide you a great Stylian food & Sicilian experience ....","33793":"A beautiful and perfectly located hotel. Loved every minute of our stay. The only complaint I have is that that they charge to use their pool (what\u2019s with that?). Other than that the hotel is five star in all respects","33794":"Being easy to find and with (chargeable) parking is a godsend in Ortigia. Our room was a good size with wooden floor, fitted furniture and a huge marble bathroom. View over the harbour from the front is worthwhile. Room generally well equipped including kettle and fridge, the only complaint I had was that the AC didn\u2019t work very well (and never when you were not in the room) so it was always a bit hot. I think in the summer it would be a problem.\n\nThere is a lift to all floors once inside the main entrance, where they kindly provide umbrellas in case of rain. Breakfast on the top floor had a great view and was a pretty good spread of savoury and sweet dishes, although the coffee service was a bit confused. Probably the best breakfast we had in Sicily.\n\nEverywhere is walking distance from here in Ortigia and we also walked to the Greek theatre site from here.","33795":"My wife and I spent 5 nights at this beautiful hotel. The amenities were top shelf. The rooms a spacious and well designed. The staff is very helpful and accommodating. Loved the breakfasts on the roof top terrace with a great view of the harbor and duomo. A great location with easy walks to the sites. I recommend this hotel highly for your stay.","33797":"This 5 star hotel has a great location with a view of the water at the restaurant rooftop. The dinner is very nice, but if you just want a drink they receive you very poorly even though the front desk recommended it for drinks. They said we could only stay for an hour. Our room 307 was next to the service door and kitchen. It was very noisy from early morning (3:30am) into the day. I would only give it a 4 star rating.","33798":"Had lunch on the third floor of the hotel. Lots of steps to climb to get to the restaurant. The lunch was very good- Penne antipasti with fish ragout and swordfish rolls, .The restaurant has a great view.","33799":"Check in was pleasant and reasonably efficient. We had booked a superior room with sea view and were lucky enough to get the corner room 303 mentioned in an earlier review here. We particularly appreciated the floor to ceiling glass on 2 sides and the wrap-around (narrow) balcony with a small table and 2 fixed seats (not used because too hot while there). Fab sunsets.\n\nIt is not a particularly large room but well designed, with plenty of room for 2 large and 2 medium suitcases, and king bed with firm mattress, as well as a round table and 2 armchairs. At \u00a3300 a night, we felt the room was not overpriced for its location on the seafront in Ortigia.\n\nUnlike the standard rooms, this superior room had a kettle, various tea bags and packets of sugar. A bottle of water was in the room on arrival but not replenished (Although a previous reviewer of this room did not have a kettle or water.)\n\nSad pillows, small TV we never turned on, and usual small fridge with a price list for all the bottles. (Don\u2019t understand why hotels are so passionate about filling these room fridges to the brim when 77% of guests apparently never partake. Everything else in the guest\u2019s room is for their sole use, so why not the fridge?)\n\nSmall but good enough shower room with hairdryer, toiletries and bathrobes. Water pressure medium-low. Small but adequate wardrobe with safe and some shelves (never use drawers as it\u2019s the most likely way to leave belongings behind).\n\nThe room is made up twice daily with changes of towels if desired. The bed linen was not changed during our 3 nights. Most of the time the room was quiet but there were always some people insisting on shouting at each other in the hallway at night. The a\/c was weird; it was a choice of on or off and the settings could not be altered - and sometimes it would just turn itself on.\n\nBreakfast was generous and, although several past reviews said the meats were not good quality nor well presented, this seems to have improved. There is a good choice of pastries, cakes, breads, fruits, juices, cold cuts, smoked salmon, eggs, bacon, cheeses, yogurts, cereals, and more. Quality of everything was quite good. Coffee of your choice is brought to your table. Service was erratic, once we had to ask 3 times for coffee.\n\nBreakfast is in the same rooftop restaurant as dinner, with a wonderful sea view. We had dinner there once and were rather disappointed: pretty presentation but bland - and too arrogant to put salt and pepper on the tables (good thing I always carry sea salt).\n\nThere is a bar on the ground floor that is open for lunch and until 7.30pm which we did not try. Several times we asked at reception for some euros for tips or to change a 50 euro note but they never seemed able to help and once they suggested we try a bar! (First time at a 5* hotel that could not give change.)\n\nIf you want laundry done, a launderette just around the corner on via XX Settembre will do it beautifully (same day if brought in by 11am) for half the hotel price (open 8.30am-7.30pm but not Sundays).\n\nAs other reviews have written here, this seems more like a 4* hotel than 5*.","33800":"this hotel has one of the best locations in Ortigia, Siracusa. BUT Beware this hotel has 2 star service with a 5 star price tag. we had a couple of issues when we checked in and asked for the manger and we were told that they had no manager on duty and that no one was in charge. we tried for two days to track a manager down and no one ever contacted us even after we left several messages and stopped by the front desk several times. they also closed the main bar for a big tour group and there was no other place to get a drink in the hotel until 7:30pm when the upstairs restaurant opened. the upstairs bar\/restaurant opens at 7:30pm and has the best view in town but unless you are eating there they put you in a back corner and treat you like you just crashed a private party. most of the rooms are also on a split level with the bathroom on the second floor next to the uncomfortable bed. there is no place to sit upstairs and a small uncomfortable love seat and chair downstairs. if you have trouble going up and down stairs this is also not a place for you. the sea view rooms cost more but there is a very minimal view that is not worth it. no pool but they will take you to the beach 20 minutes away by boat for another fee. i would avoid this overpriced place because Ortigia and Siracusa have too many more reasonable options to choose from. location A plus, service F-. C+ average.","33801":"This hotel is located right on downtown Ortigia waterfront. This property is clearly well loved by the owners and staff. The lobby and common areas area clean, decorated in very good taste, every chair and artifact is placed right where it should be.\nWhen you walk out of the lobby you step right into the pulse of Ortigia waterfront, the duomo is a short walk, plenty of local restaurants and beautiful narrow streets to wonder about.\nThe rooms are spacious, clean, everything worked perfectly. We had a junior suite and it was great.\nThe rooftop restaurant has a 270 degree view of the waterfront, just magnificent to sit back and enjoy with morning breakfast. We had breakfast included and it was worth every euro. Good variety, fresh, well presented and good taste.\nThe staff is attentive, polite, helpful. Evidently well trained and well motivated.\nWe arranged the reservation and Catania airport transfer before hand via e mail with a credit card and there were no issues of any kind.\nEvery thing worked out perfectly with no hiccups or issues of any kind.\nA shout out to front desk staff Luciano, Chiara and Lia.","33802":"Stayed a couple of nights in early September 2019. Arrived late the first night after the hour long drive from Catania airport. The clerk at the reception could not have been more helpful, with the luggage and also arranging to park the car at the hotels private lot. Also provided helpful hints on where to have a late night meal and what to see on Ortigia, which was beautiful at night, with small streets and a gorgeous plaza in front of Duomo Siracusa. We had reserved a room on the third floor with a private balcony with views of the port and town, room 303. Would highly recommend. The breakfast every morning was very good, with plentiful of choices, healthy as well as sweet! And the staff at the restaurant were super friendly and helpful. I would certainly recommend this property as it is in perfect walking to all the sights on Ortigia. The rooftop restaurant has beautiful views, the private parking lot is a pluss and overall the helpfulness of the staff was great. They also provided a very nice recommendation for dinner on our second evening, Perle d'Ortigia, which we truly enjoyed. Overall, a great stay on our first trip to Sicily!","33807":"We stayed at this hotel for 5 nights at the beginning of August.\nThe location is fantastic. Great for exploring Ortigia. It is on the marina and easy to locate if you are driving. For 15 euros a night they will take your car when you arrive and park it for you. This is a lot of money but I would advise doing this as Ortigia is a nightmare for driving and parking- especially if you are not used to driving abroad!\nWe booked a double room with sea view. The room was disappointing. It was on a split mezzanine level with very long windows over the 2 levels. This sounds great but wasn\u2019t as heavy thick dark drapes hung over these totally obscuring light and view. The room was clean but everything is very dated and tired looking. The decor in the room feels like old bits of furnishings have been pulled together from different rooms around the hotel, each with a different decor and colour scheme. The shower is in the bath and old.\nWe had hoped for a lounging terrace at the hotel and had assumed that the terrace on photographs and mentioned were in the listing would be available for lounging in the sun throughout the day. However the rooftop terrace is only used as dining for the restaurant when it is open.\nWe had hoped for a lot more from this hotel and left feeling underwhelmed.","33811":"The Hotel describes itself as a 5 Star Hotel and charges 350 Euros per night. The picture of the web shows a beautiful building at night so one believes it is a Top Hotel. IT IS NOT!!!....\nEverything in the Hotel is old, dirty and smelly. From carpets, furniture, bathrooms, shower, bathtub, bathroom accessories. The bathrooms smell of urine. Our bathtub had lost's of hair that appeared as we opened the Shower. We had to bathe using flipflops. Also the internet is poor and complicated. And the service is mediocre.\nI do not recommend anyone to go to this Hotel!!","33813":"Well located hotel on the edge of Ortigia. Good rooms, though the split levels were slightly strange, but perfect for a few days in Beautiful Ortigia. Restaurant\/bar service was its downside especially for the prices they were charging for breakfast and drinks.","33827":"The service at this hotel was good. We had a standard room which was of a satisfactory size although I wouldn't describe it as 'large'. Breakfast was fine. I thought that the room could have been cleaner, and I was very dissappointed to be charged \u20ac3 for a pool towel. I have stayed at many hotels in Italy and I have never come across such a charge before. The location is ideal for the archeological park, but a good walk for most other sites. The hotel is good value for money which is why I think it just about merits its Tripadvisor rating.","33833":"Reception processing was good. My case was taken to my room for me.\nLovely well appointed, comfortable room with all amenities,. Walk in shower.\nNice pool area with great views. Was not happy at being charged \u20ac3 for a pool towel.\nDecent buffet breakfast, fair selection of items to choose from. Had dinner in the restaurant and the food was good.\nBar and restaurant service was excellent\nGood English spoken by the staff.\nIt is handy for the archeological park but some way from the city centre.","33835":"Large room and comfortable bed. Ideal location for visiting the Archeological Site opposite. Handy taxi ride into Ortigia. Restaurant on site for meal if do not wish to go out. The rooftop pool and bar are great for relaxing in the sun. Weather perfect in September.","33843":"Stayed here for 2 nights as part of a tour with other fellow solo travellers. Room was of a large size, overlooking the neighbouring petrol station.\n\nMy great points\n. Nice variety of breakfast items to suit all needs\n. Like the way the TV (which I didn't use due to lack of non-news English channels) was concealed behind the mirror\n. Decent hairdryer\n. Room was fully dark when curtains closed and all lights off\n. Plenty of plug points\n. Staff very friendly\n\nMy niggles\n. Shower head was too heavy for the bracket and kept dropping. Had to resort using the shower head in my hand\n. The Jacuzzi in the bath, the variable control was broken. So it was either off or full blast with water spraying everywhere - when I just filled the bath to the jets\n. I was charged in GBP for my account rather than Euro which gave a poorer exchange rate by 4.5 cents per GBP based on other card transactions I did in Sicily","33846":"The hotel was clean and comfortable, but full restaurant service was only for five days a week. The only problem was that the airconditioning and toilet extractor fan were on a timer, rather than when you needed them, which seemed a poor system. The staff were very good and the food was of a good standard.","33856":"After many hours of travel, you want to be greeted and welcomed by the team at this hotel. They are friendly and ever so helpful and it matters! I\u2019ve stayed at hotels where staff don\u2019t care. I\u2019ve stayed at hotels where there\u2019s a single outstanding member of staff but I am please to say that all staff at this hotel were fantastic. The hotel is in a great location and the rooftop pool is a great place to relax and cool down after exploring the town on a hot day. I must say that we did run into an issue on our morning of departure as there had recently been a change to the bus route and ultimately the bus stop where we were told we could catch our bus from was not in use. After returning to the hotel, the staff went above and beyond to help us find a solution, make us comfortable and make sure we made the next bus. Fantastic staff!!!","33862":"Fantastic service. Lovely clean restaurant. Food fresh, yummy and well priced. Overlooking the pool so great for the kids. Very enjoyable. View great and nice being surrounded by healthy living plants.","33864":"Bed was comfortable, air conditioning worked, staff were ok. Breakfast choice was limited. Wi-fi information given to us when we checked in was wrong so we could not access it. Bar and restaurant were on the 6th floor - strange!! Bar prices were very reasonable.","33866":"20-30 min walk away from the tourist old town. The only present choicr for those who deem a gym and pool essential. Predictable Mercure standard and service. Although we didn't try, but food looked fresh even if relatively simple.","33867":"Nice staff,\nBig choices for breakfast\nThe location is very convenient- next to the Greco Theatre and close to the bus taking tourists to all touristic attractions and Ortigia island for only 1 euro.\nThe hotel has free parking and garage for 7 euro per day","33883":"We re-stayed here after 8 years and booked an Executive room as there is a convertible sofa. After 8 years the bathrooms, although still clean, show some wear and tear.\nThe hotel is situated next to a busy road (many traffic jams), but also in front of the archeological park of Syracusa.\nThe hotel is also very close to the Madonna delle Lacrime church.\nWe slept very well and with the windows closed (room at the side of the hotel) we weren't disturbed by traffic.\nWe didn't try the hotel restaurant, but the breakfast was Mercure-standard, with some local specialities added (crostata alla ricotta, latte di mandorla, ..)\nCoffee is DIY and comes from a machine.\nThere is a swimming pool on the roof, next to the restaurant but the water was still extremely cold.\nMany restaurants are in Ortigia, which counts for a 25-30 minute walk one-way every\nevening.\nThere is a secure parking area (free) and a garage (to be payed).\nStaff (reception, cleaning, breakfast, pool\/bar) is very friendly and this makes a stay in this hotel a very good experience.","33942":"I cannot rate zero points out of five so I will give it a 1\/5. And that is for the friendly staff and clean rooms. But the mattresses are horrible! Shame on the owner of this hotel for claiming 5 stars and make guests sleep on these horrible beds that should have been replaced ages ago. Too old. Too thin. Placed on a plain wooden underground. You can feel the springs poking in your body, so sleepless nights are guaranteed. No matter how okay-ish everything else is, I would recommend everyone to avoid at all costs until renovated.","33943":"My daughter and I stayed at Eureka Palace and thoroughly enjoyed it so much that we returned for two more nights a week later. It\u2019s clean and beautiful, and close to beaches. Our room overlooked horse race tracks and we enjoyed watching horses very much. We even Visited the stables and everyone was super friendly to let us pet their beautiful horses. The SPA was awesome! I\u2019d give this hotel 10 stars if I could, and I highly recommend it. BELLISSIMO!!!","33957":"We got this hotel with a packaged deal of flights + hotel, they told us its a 5 star hotel.\nThe good: large and clean room, large bed, indoor pool , spa and gym.\nNeeds improvement: very minimal breakfast, more desert than fresh food, almost no vegetables, for us as vegetarians it was a problem. For espresso you need to pay.\nBed is not not so comfortable and creaky.\nSpa is not expensive, but you will only get small towel and you should go half naked to the shower.\nAlmost no one speak English, cause probably they used to see only local tourists.\nLocation is middle of nowhere, far from any attraction, scary to get there in a dark night.","33972":"We stayed 3 nights at Eureka hotel. It's literally located in the middle of nowhere but I had a car so for us this wasn't a big issue, but it's an issue.\nLobby is great: huge and nicely decorated.\nRooms are very big and modern with nice tile and bathroom's appliances. Rooms are very clean too.\nWi-Fi is good and stable.\nCertainly there are ares of desired improvements: the mattress is veeery hard, like a plywood.The pillows are even worse: all synthetic, small size and only 3 of them for the King size bed.\nBreakfast is huge disappointment: water down juice, eggs from the box of powder, undrinkable coffee, etc. This was the worst breakfast at any hotel during my 2 weeks long trip in Italy. To have this breakfast in Sicily's (with it's delicious meals) it's just a shame. We had great meals everywhere outside of Eureka.\nService was below average too: the area around the pool and spa while clean in the morning wasn't maintained throughout the day.\nService at the front desk was fine.","33976":"We spent 4 nights here in early February. The city is quiet at this time of year but it's a really nice time to visit and this was a perfect place to stay. Our room on the second floor overlooked the ocean (from across the street). There was a wind storm while we were there and the waves were wonderful and intense at times.\n\nThe staff members are excellent, helpful, and offered good suggestions for restaurants and places to visit. There isn't an elevator but staff member Davide carried our luggage to our room. This was our third visit to Ortigia and Domus Mariae our favorite of the places we've stayed. It's a bit out of the city center but that's part of it's charm.\n\nBreakfast is served across the street at Domus Mariae Bennessere. It was good with fresh-made cakes, pastries, homemade yogurt, delicious jams and more. Be sure to ask to see the Church of St. Filippo Neri in the same location.\n\nThe bathroom is spotlessly clean though the shower ensemble was a bit odd but functional. There is a TV in the room with International channels and the WiFi was good.\n\nWe were very happy with our stay here and will return on our next visit to Ortigia!\n\nThank you!","33977":"Cinzia at the front desk arranged inexpensive transfer from Catania airport to the hotel and recommended 2 close-by restaurants that were very good.\nHad ocean view room that was very nice at a reasonable price.","33980":"This was the first hotel of our 16 day trip and we knew this bar was set high. Loved everything about our stay. We had a spacious room with a gorgeous sea view! At night we could hear the waves crashing. Location was great, just a couple blocks from the parking garage. Staff was wonderful! Bathroom was good with a modern shower, plenty of hot water and room for our stuff. There were extra pillows and the bed was comfy. Breakfast was across the street in the sister hotel, very easy and lovely. There was also a rooftop terrace with a nice view. We would love to go back!","33983":"My husband and I stayed at this beautiful well kept hotel for 3 nights. The staff were amazing and the hotel was spotless. The rooms were spacious and well kept. The air conditioning worked well and we had a lovely balcony overlooking the street. This hotel was an old convent and sometimes we saw the sisters walking around the hotel. it had a great vibe to it and we were able to walk around Syracuse, to the main square and to all of the little quaint streets nearby. It was in a good location. The breakfast was amazing and had a lot of variety and home baked cakes. I would definitely recommend and will definitely stay here again.","33986":"The sea view room I booked was not available due to an unexpected plumbing problem but that was just a bit of bad luck and they could not have been more apologetic (unnecessarily as nobodies fault) . Replacement room was excellent and a discount given. Lovely people and a great spot. Recommend.","33988":"We had 3 nights here and will always remember opening the black out shutters to the wonderful, sea and sunny view every morning.Our room was lovely with everything we needed.\n\nWe had a lovely few days in Syracuse, we had dropped off our car hire at the eupopcar, which was an easy drop off, and walked with our cases which made our stay very easy as no parking to worry about, we got the train when we moved on to Catania.\nWe loved wondering round the old streets and walked everywhere, even up to the Amphitheatre. this was perfect place to stay,\nhad a wonderful lunch everyday at the fish market at Fratelli Burgio.\n\nBreakfast although was good enough it was the poorest we had during our trip,","33991":"I had a wonderful stay here for four nights on my own in March. I loved the atmosphere: the hotel is very hospitable, the sisters are around some of the time, I tended to bump into them in the evening. Luisa on the front desk was especially helpful with tours, questions etc.\nI don't use hotels that often - we tend to stay in Airbnbs - so I recognise that maybe I'm not your typical hotel guest. I don't want subservient staff who act like servants. The authentic kindness and helpfulness of the Domus Mariae was perfect for me.\nI felt the hotel was very good value, immensely comfortable, very clean. Breakfast was very good, even if the capuccino was made by machine.","33994":"We were fortunate to spend two lovely evening at this lovely property...managed by Catholic Sisters (Nuns). It's adjacent to a quant chapel, so has been repurposed as a viable and well-managed hotel. Domus Mariae has a fantastic location on the island of Ortigia, in the heart of Siracusa. The rooftop terrace offers a beautiful sea view and there is also a luxury wellness center on site.\n\nThis charming hotel is set in a 14th-century property with a large hall where you can read, watch TV, and take advantage of free Wi-Fi internet. We absolutely loved our stay here and recommend unequivocally to others!","33995":"Although the customer service was very good, and the sea (right in front of the hotel) offers an outstanding view, I need to say that I am not planning to return to the Domus Mariae Albergo Hotel.\n\nThe main reason is strictly concerning the cleaning of the rooms. Specifically the beds.\nIt was so bad that both me and my companion got a rash. It was obvious that the bed sheets where either dusty or had God-knows-what which caused such a bad reaction in the skin which we didn't experienced in any other hotel during our trip in Europe, which took us thru various cities\/hotels.\n\nActually this hotel have a notification encouraging guests not to request the cleaning unless needed, but, Does that means that the beds are not going to be washed and cleaned after the prior guest left either?!.... because that is exactly how it felt.\n\nThe neighborhood surrounding the hotel doesn't feel that safe either. One afternoon we were chased by two young guys as we were walking the narrow streets to visit the DaVinci Museum.\n\nAgain, the staff at the hotel was wonderful, but I must comment on an incident at its sister hotel- the Domus Mariae Bennessere, which is located across the street, and where breakfast buffet was served for those whose rooms included such service (which was our case).\n\nThe Domus Mariae Albergo hotel doesn't seem to have a restaurant or a bar. Hence, one night as I asked the rep at our hotel if there was a place where I can get hot chocolate she directed me to a cafe \"close-by\", she said. I explained to her that I didn't wanted to walk far as I was concerned with the incident of the guys chasing us.\n\nAs I followed her directions I found myself walking the same narrow streets where we were followed the day before. Hence, I decided to return without the hot chocolate.\n\nAs she saw me returning with empty hands she directed me to the sister hotel across the street. (By the way, when I asked her about the hot chocolate originally I inquired if I could get the drink at the sister hotel and she said no). But now, she is telling me that she will call them and sending me there...\n\nWhen I showed to the Domus Mariae Bennessere front desk the staff there with a very stuck- up attitude said that she was going to make an exception by serving me the drink. She explained that she regularly would provide the service exclusively to her guests.\n\nI explained that I was not expecting the drink for free and that I was ready to pay for it right there.\n\nShe said \"You will pay after they serve you\", and proceeded to escort me to their bar.\n\nAt the bar the staff had an equally stuck- up attitude and took his sweet time as he prepared a powder hot chocolate drink...\n\nThen gave a receipt, and directed me back to the first stuck-up lady at the main counter to pay. She too took her sweet time to collect the money which I had in cash, and at the end of all the ordeal only to buy a cup of powder hot chocolate I made it back to my room with a cold- hot chocolate,..\n\n..of course, they didn't even had a proper carry-out cup that could maintain a hot drink hot for the guests to take to their room..\n\nI short-\nI would not return to stay at the Domus Mariae Albergo because their beds need serious cleaning.\n\nI would not even consider its sister hotel, the Domus Mariae Bennessere because its staff ignores that the good customer service skills (and not the conceited attitude) is the one which translates into quality business and prospective customers,...and without customers, there is no business...","34000":"From before we arrived until after we left, every member of the hotel staff was delightful. We checked parking before arrival and they registered our hire car registration so we had no worries with driving into the ZTL; We had made some errors when booking which they resolved to our benefit; their help and guidance during our stay and after check out resolved a further issue we had created. We felt \"at home' for our whole 3 night stay. The Albergo is conveniently located for leisurely walks through Ortygia and with the car parked safely in the Talete parking (\u20ac10 for 24 hours) a short walk away we didn't need to use it. Breakfast in the \"mother\" hotel across the road was excellent and we have enjoyed making their hard boiled eggs since arriving home. On a return trip to Sicily this would be top of our list to stay again.","34001":"You are right on the foreshore here with an unbroken view of the sea. Yet you are also minutes away from the centre of the island. The rooms are large and airy with a large bathroom. Davide and Cinzia make your stay comfortable and nothing is too much trouble. They go out of their way to help. I would go back here in a heartbeat.","34003":"Lovely place to stay in Syracusa, situated close to the seaside. We had a room with balcony and enjoyed the sun rising and the waves from the ocean just beneath the hotel. Quite large room and good bed. Staff very friendly. Nice breakfast in the Ben essere part of the hotel, and there is also a beautiful chapel to visit as the hotel onde was a monastery.\nIf I ever come back, this hotel will be my choice again.","34006":"We spent two nights and most of three days in Siracusa and enjoyed this hotel. The room was dark and uninteresting at first, but when we opened the shutters to the small balcony overlooking the sea, it was transformed.\n\nThe staff was energetic and extremely accommodating The long stairways (with no lift) were daunting, but at least we had someone carrying the luggage for us.\n\nWe were able to park in a public space quite nearby and leave the car there for our entire stay.\n\nThe hotel is on Ortygia, which is where you want to be while in Siracusa, and a convenient walk into the center of town -- a walk that became quite familiar as we made it repeatedly over three days.\n\nThe only negative (dropping the rating from 5 to 4) was the rather disappointing breakfast. We skipped it the second day and ate elsewhere.","34007":"Truth to tell: parking was an issue. To get to the hotel, you have to drive down a street open to residents only. And this lovely part of Ortigia was full: even the local \"parking guys\" who hang around to help you find a spot, could not. So we parked a few blocks away in the municipal lot. No biggie. Upon checking in, Davide could not have been more helpful or informative. The hotel arranged for our license plate to be registered with the police so that we could use the aforementioned street. And Cinthia gave us proof of this just in case the police eventually ticket us, via Hertz.\nBut I digress: this place is lovely. Super convenient. Great sea views from the room. Wonderful service and a gorgeous house cat at reception. And breakfast across the street in the ritzier annex is copious and delicious.","34008":"Stayed for 3 nights here and are so glad that we chose this hotel. The owner(I think) at the reception was very kind and smiley, so are other staff, felt like we are staying at the very comfy B&B. We recommend you booking a room with a sea view as we did, breath-taking view is waiting for you. The location is perfect, less than10 minutes you can reach popular street market and Apollo temple, many good restaurants and bars, and importantly, a nice beach in 5-6 minutes. Breakfast is taken at the adjacent\nannex hotel across the street. It is extensive enough for the Italian breakfast.\nWe do recommend this hotel as your base for holiday making in Ortigia island.","34016":"The Domus Mariae hotel is split into 2 separate properties on opposite sides of the road. We stayed at the much cheaper Domus Mariae Albergo and what great value for money it offers. There is a steep staircase from the street to the reception but the staff will not allow anyone to carry bags up or down. The incredible lady on reception has worked at the hotel for over 20 years. She is tireless, strong and absolutely full of good advice (listen to her!). The building is old and the large high-ceiling rooms are charming but simple. The hotel is clean, comfortable and reasonably quiet and situated on the waterfront effectively in the centre of Syracuse's old town. Free parking is available on the street. Breakfast is provided in the smarter Domus Mariae opposite.","34018":"Just returned after a very relaxing week in Ortigia and this little hotel was wonderful.\nRooms were just the right size but very airy due to the high ceilings and most importantly, the bed was so comfortable I could have just not bothered getting up!!!!!!!\nEverything was spotless and the shower was amazing.\n\nAdd to that the friendly helpful staff and the fact that all the attractions were a short walking distance away.....it would be difficult to find anywhere better.","34023":"I loved everything about this hotel. It is small and charming, with simply furnished rooms and great service, and a spectacular location right on the Lungomare. My room on the second floor had a comfortable bed, a sofa, dresser, and armoire - and a balcony with panoramic views of the sea and the town in every direction. I woke up each morning to glorious sunrises and sometimes I just enjoyed relaxing on the balcony in the afternoon watching all the passers-by. The entire staff was helpful and friendly. I was sorry that I only met Cinthia once, and briefly, but the rest of the staff were all wonderful. Davide went out of his way to be helpful and attentive. Breakfast, which was served in the sister hotel right across the street, was excellent, with a great variety of salata e dolce, (salty and sweet) and the most delicious freshly made ricotta I've ever tasted. I was there for a full week, but I could have stayed there forever.","34024":"From the moment we walked in, we felt warming welcomed! Ever staff member there was incredibly friendly and helpful. Cinthia was dynamite, happily whisking our luggage up the stairs without breaking a sweat!The accommodations were lovely, comfortable beds, nice features. Breakfast was across the street at the other Domus Albergo, which was quite lovely. Very positive experience!","34025":"Small and familial hotel. Great location and staff and above of all some of the rooms have Balcony to the sea. Breakfast is around the corner with a great exclusive feeling. Situated on a promenade great for morning walks to the local market.","34026":"We spent five very enjoyable days staying at the Domus in a great room with balcony and sea view. The breakfast buffet was very good and the staff could not have been nicer or more helpful. Highly recommended.","34027":"Associated with a Benedictine convent across the street, which has a spa and pool, there's a vibe at Domus Mariae. The guys were calm as seminarians. Cynthia, a firecracker, the manager perhaps, gave us an earful, spontaneously, apparently in the Sicilian way. She's annoyed, we learned, about zoning restrictions on Ortigia. Cynthia's absolutely right. We strongly recommend Osteria da Seby nearby.","34031":"Loved this place. I had a wonderful room with a Sea View off the Balcony. Great location, wonderful staff, fantastic breakfast. Couldn't have been better. My favorite hotel of my recent trip to Sicily.","34032":"I cannot fault this beautiful boutique hotel. Opposite its sister hotel (where breakfast is served) the sea view is awe inspiring. The reception staff could not have been more friendly or helpful. Ginger the cat was a hit with the children. At 119 euros for a sea view room, it was well worth the money, and if I ever return to Syracuse, I wouldn't book anywhere else.","34071":"We spend the night here with our very well traveled Labrador and hade a great stay.\nWe enjoyed a lovely dinner, had a great night sleep and had a quick breakfast before setting off again.\nTip; Have patience with the shower it takes a while to heat up, but it\u2019s worth the wait!","34133":"I enjoyed my stay at this hotel. Location is great, quiet area. Rooms are simple but clean and large. A good breakfast with fresh cannoli and several other goodies is served in a very nice setting.\nAt the reception desk Jessica and Federica are always ready to assist you with anything you may need.\nAt the same location you must visit the oldest Jewish Bath, found during the restoration of this building in 1980, 18 meters below. Photos are not allowed during the visit. There is a 30\u2019 guided tour every day between 10am and 1pm.","34135":"Personnel was very helpful. The restaurant suggestions provided were fantastic and not too touristic. Breakfast was complete and very good: yogourt, fruits , self service eggs, cheeses, croissant and coffee. However, the rooms would need some small adjustments, curtains, shower door and bathroom lighting. The electric outlets were also rare to recharge our cell or else. The apartment was clean and the bed moderately comfortable. The common rooms on 1st floor, breakfast room and salon were really charming. The visit of the Jewish baths for 5 euros was a bit exp\u00e9ditive. Centrally located but far from only parking, Telute at 0.8 km so you need to walk with all your luggage. Once we discovered the area, we found a place to pick up our luggages. Difficult to locate.","34136":"This hotel is well located in a series of renovated buildings in the little streets of the island\/peninsula of Syracuse. The rooms are spacious and we had a nice terrace. Facilities are all good except the wifi is a bit slow and if you do not like stairs you maybe challenged. The breakfasts are good.\n\nPart of its charm is that it is not at all like a modern international hotel.\n\nIt is not far from the duomo and there are plenty of restaurants nearby. Thoroughly recommended.","34137":"This is a very unique hotel. Each room is different. Ours was on the first floor, but a little dark. It could have used a few more windows. Being on the ground floor, too, and a few steps down at that, we kept closed the windows we had. On a hot summer day, that\u2019s probably pretty nice. It had A\/C, a good sized bathroom, though there were a few problems with the sink drain (fixed the second day) and shower drain, and a broken light, but these were not insurmountable. The Hebrew baths below the hotel are an experience not to be missed.","34146":"Got off to a bad start and found driving and parking on the island of Ortigia was extremely difficult despite gps help. The room was a disappointment after the expectations I\u2019d had after seeing the photos online that had caused my choice of hotel. The stairway entry door to the rooms from the street was very old and very rusty. The room wasn\u2019t well maintained. Months of negligent detail in housekeeping showed its wear in corners and part way up the walls from the floors, in the shower, around the faucets, between the floor tiles and in the kitchen and stove area. The metal frames of the furniture showed signs of age and rust. The lighting in the bathroom was inadequate for makeup and for shaving. The AC mounted on the wall showed signs of earlier leaks and mold and stains remained on the wall below it!! The faucets and shower heads were way beyond their \u2018Best before\u2019 date. The interior design and decorating was tasteless with almost no pictures and no wooden beams on the ceilings as had been seen online. On top of all that the free WiFi advertised was out-of-order!!! My favorite choice of hotel turned out to be a huge disappointment!!!\n\nThe second day, we complained about our situation at the reception. They took us seriously and immediately came to the room to confirm our points of dissatisfaction. Within the hour we were offered alternative rooms and were moved to a new room that was absolutely amazing and filled our wishes on every point, except partially for negligent housekeeping, but this room excelled over the original room in every way!! There were wooden beams in the ceiling, tasteful, cozy lighting and attractive pictures on the walls, we had a huge balcony with lounge chairs and cactus plants, a corner room with sea views in two directions, a bathroom with modern faucets and shower heads, no AC stains on the walls, a cleaner kitchen and even WiFi that worked!!! WOW!!\n\nThe breakfasts were more than adequate and gave us a good tasting and nutritious start each day. It was even possible to fry eggs yourself at a heating pad for those who wanted to.\n\nThe main floor lobby and breakfast areas are stunningly attractive with soft lightning, tasteful d\u00e9cor and original character. Another huge plus at the Alla Giudecca is the ancient bath area 18 meters underground below the hotel offering the largest and oldest Jewish ritual bath in Europe, truly worth a visit!!\n\nSuddenly it was a perfect choice for our stay in the Ortigia\/Siracusa area!!!! And there were many reasonably priced restaurants nearby and lots of shops too! If you\u2019re going to stay in the Siracusa area, Ortigia is definitely the place to be, and of the many hotels we looked at, the Alla Giudecca had the most character and charm. Ortigia is really alive and beautiful in the evenings and the Piazza Duomo is magnificent!!","34147":"This April we visited the Italian island of Sicily, choosing Hotel alla Giudecca located on the island of Ortigia, the historical and highly walkable district of Siracusa. The Residence Hotel alla Guidecca met and exceeded our every expectation. Located on a beautiful narrow pedestrian-only street in the heart of the Jewish Quarter, the Hotel's central location is only a short walk to the sea on both sides of the island; restaurants and bars abound, and the glorious cathedral and piazza are just a brief 10-minute walk away. A taxi can drop you off at a small piazza, a 3-minute walk to the hotel. The apartment was of generous size, with a large bedroom and living room\/kitchen. Outside the entrance to our room was a shared terrace but our room did have its own private terrace with a small but welcomed view of the sea. The public areas were charming and included a large dining room and even a shop with interesting local merchandise. The breakfasts were all that could be hoped for, including a large selection of cereals, meats, cheeses, breads, fresh juices and even materials from which to create your own omelette or scrambled eggs. Be sure to visit the ancient Jewish baths which are under the hotel, available only with a guide (consult the shop keeper on premises).The desk staff spoke excellent English and were most accommodating. Alla Guidecca is a real find is this city with deep historical roots going back to Greek and Roman times.","34148":"Now what can be said that is good or even acceptable about residence hotel Alla Giudecca? We had room 11 which has a very good sized terrace. Also the staff member Federica is very lovely and competent person. The location is fine but that credit is more to do with Ortigia than the residence. That\u2019s all that was good. Now let me start with my critical analysis and pleased be warned do not stay here! When I booked this hotel as part of a 2 month tour of Italy I was looking forward to it from its historic perspective and from the on line descriptions and visuals. On arrival we were sternly greeted with an appalling attitude by a dark haired female, I give this brief description as an alert for any future guests, the apparent manager. This person must surely be a relative of the owners otherwise no one would offer her any form of work in hospitality. We are fit persons both over 60. On arrival we discovered that our room was 3 flights of stairs up, very reluctantly the male staff member carried my wife\u2019s bag, but left myself the task of negotiating the much heavier bag alone, this alone was not an issue having carried bags up stairs, in many forms of accommodation and on trains etc over many tours of Europe. However the huffing and puffing and loud sighing about the task requested should have sent a warning signal. Needless to say the service was not offered on checkout when I again negotiated the stairs with our total luggage. I understand that to put a lift in would perhaps not be possible given the historical nature of the building BUT just get a bellboy or two, it\u2019s not a cheap hotel after all. Youth unemployment is very high in Siracusa, so to management a partial solution to your many problems and a contribution to the economy.\nNow to the room; The room overall was extremely dirty, the kitchenette more so, all glassware and crockery covered in dust, no sign of a dishcloth or sponge and the overflow tray in the refrigerator was full of stagnant water. The kitchenette sink also leaked massive amounts of running water on to the floor resulting in and explaining the the smell of mould in this part of the room. Now in the bathroom the shower ran hot and cold always requiring a dance to be performed every time we used it. The shower also leaked constantly and could not be secured to its wall mounted position without holding the water outlet by hand. Some photos taken as an example of the hotel\u2019s issues are included for trip adviser readers. Breakfast was \u201creasonable\u201d but on the second morning of our 5 night stay the toaster to quote the waitress \u201cblew up\u201d, again needless to say no replacement device ever appeared. What this \u201chotel \u201c desperately needs is a check list regimen or quality assurance system so that all of these now long term issues might be addressed bgrandy upper management (Ermes hotel group) and then improved and maintained. A grand first step would be \u201cthe letting go\u201d of the aforementioned horrible staff member. I have reviewed accommodation all around the world this is the most condemning of any that I have undertaken. No more can be said. Be cautious if you have booked or intend to book this hotel.","34149":"The hotel was included in our packaged tour which stated a three-star ranking. But I would say this is my worse hotel stay ever. To go to your room, you need to walk pass a back alley with potted plants in disarray, stagnant water, strayed cat and the ever present bad smell and flies!\nAt night time, the back alley is all dark and reception works only from 0800-2100 (and she did not show to care of the hotel condition anyway). The room is quite rundown with air-con chirring sound as background. A deserted hotel as I didn\u2019t meet any other guests!\nAnd then cones the dozen of flies in the room! The tour operator explained this hotel is only a back-up option , after complaint. The hotel put insecticides to improve the conditions and offered to change to another room, which we found is no better just that it had less flies but you have to walk up dozens of steps. With our heavy luggage and towards end of the trip we stayed a scary night and rushed to airport at day break.","34151":"Great experience. Historic hotel with modern amenities. Casual but elegant atmosphere, fabulous quiet location and warm and friendly staff.\nThe hotel is located in a pedestrian area which is good except that you have to find a nearby parking place and then find the hotel!\nThe staff physically walked to our car to make sure we parked in a good spot, then carried our luggage to our room.\nGreat breakfasts, lovely rooms and again, the location in the heart of historic Ortigia was the best. It was a treat just to walk around the hotel with all of its antiques and history.\nWe highly recommend this hotel.","34152":"I stayed there with my family in May 2019. The only good thing about this place is the location and the exteriors of the hotel, which are dating from the medieval era and which are nice. For the rest it's awful. Breakfast was terrible, with the worst caf\u00e9 i experienced in Sicily, and the rooms are poorly furnished. But the staff was truly the major problem in this hotel. Like other reviewers pointed it, the staff is not only unresponsive, unhelpful, but also aggressive : I got shouted at in italian by a maid for using the bathroom downstairs. When we left the hotel the girl at the counter did not even bother to look at us and kept playing on her mobile phone. Most of the times it felt like you were more a bother than a client. There was not a single smile or welcoming word. It was the worst experience i had in Sicily (which has great places and great people) and i recommend to book somewhere else. The staff of this hotel is unfortunately the worst i have ever seen in my travels around the world.","34154":"Good location, great room, good beds, nice balcony. Jewish baths a must visit. Service is lacking a bit, bed linen not changed in 4 days, soap for some reason removed from our room the last day, no extra toiletpaper either. Breakfast straff a bit unenthusiastic, could never say good morning or give a smile in 4 days either. The hotel in itself is very nice, but the straff needs to do a better job.","34156":"Very good location in an overall quiet corner of Ortigia. Stayed one night on the Easter weekend. Easy to walk everywhere.\nThe public paid parking garage is about a 10 min walk. Easy to do. It\u2019s clean and spacious. Breakfast was very good, much more substantial than the typical Italian breakfast fare. (They just have a sweet croissant and coffee usually). But you can prepare you own eggs and squeeze fresh juice.\nHeard a bit of noise as we were on the street side so if people leave early, you\u2019d hear. The room had a small kitchenette. I\u2019d stay here again if I came back to Ortigia! Restaurants Al Mazari and the wine bar around the corner on Via Roma are worth a visit. And the Bordieri \u2018sandwich\u2019 shop in the market is worth the wait. Simply Amazing! Bring an appetite for the best one you\u2019ll ever eat in your life.","34157":"This is a charming B and B down a narrow passageway. It has beautiful public rooms downstairs including two very pretty sitting rooms. Our room (11) was up two steep stone stairs and across an internal courtyard on the top floor. It was simple, clean, spacious and comfortable. There is a small kitchenette area with saucepans but no kettle, and small fridge. It\u2019s a small thing but when we arrived the plug for our sink was missing and it was very unpleasant to look into the dirty plug hole. I covered it with the plug from the bidet. Breakfast is good - you can squeeze your own orange juice and fry your own eggs. The coffee could be better. This is peaceful, comfortable and good value base in Ortigia.","34160":"The hotel is a charming place built atop old Jewish baths (you can take a tour of the place). In fact one should explore the other rooms on the ground floor \u2013 they are filled with old books and tapestries gifted to the owner.\nIt is on one of Ortigia\u2019s small inner roads so you might not be able to take the car right in. There is also no elevator (in case you are on the first\/second floor).","34163":"We were two families, occupying four rooms at Alla Guidecca, in the annex which is arrayed around a lovely courtyard. We simply loved the place -- the rooms were very spacious though spare, quite comfortable for families. Breakfast was served in the main building, a restored mansion in the old Jewish quarter, and was quite good. The hotel is steps from the sea and perfectly located for wandering through the alleys of Ortigia, itself a gem. And most of all, the staff was terrifically helpful, arranging cars for day outings, booking restaurants, and generally warm and welcoming. Not a luxury hotel -- bathrooms in some rooms were quite small -- but great for travelers looking for affordable comfort and architectural charm.","34165":"This is a small hotel well-situated on Ortigia and has all the potential to be a great boutique hotel. The history, architecture and room size are all perfect. It fits in well with its location and offers the added interest of being right above the site of the ancient Jewish mikvas uncovered several years ago. The service is helpful and accommodating.\n\nThis hotel could be perfect except for a few key flaws. Breakfast was adequate but uninspired, especially compared with so many we had elsewhere in Italy. They also need to upgrade their bathrooms - especially the hair dryers. Be warned - they are the old-fashioned wall mounted fixtures with barely any air flowing out of them. Not okay for anyone who really needs to dry and style their hair!\n\nAll in all, a good hotel that could be great.","34166":"Great hotel in the center of Ortigia. Our room was in fact an apartment with a large bedroom, a living-room, a bathroom, a second smaller room... and a private terrace with sea view!\nWonderful place! To be recommended!","34169":"This Residencia is located in the charming Jewish Quarter of Ortigia that is linked to Syracuse by 2 bridges. The main areas in the hotel are certainly interesting. By the way, Ortigia is definitely the place to stay when in Syracuse that really lacks any charm whatsoever.\n\nThe hotel is pleasant enough but the rooms are spartan and the bathrooms need updating. Our shower missed part of it's screen so water poured onto the floor. The glass shelf above the sink was so close to the tap that it was difficult to turn the tap on and the bathroom as a whole needed attention. A waste bin in the bedroom and\/or living room would have been an asset.\n\nAs others have said, not all the staff were particularly helpful but this was made up by two members. We experienced difficulties on the first night due to a door or window somewhere in the hotel banging very loudly that prevented sleep but no staff appeared to be on duty at night so we only had 2 hours sleep! The next day we reported this and were moved to a better room and clearly the problem had been sorted out.\n\nWe knew parking would be impossible on the island, so opted to pay the hotel \u20ac20 per night to garage the car which isn't ideal but when one arrives in pouring rain and cannot get anywhere near the hotel, we felt it best.\n\nBreakfasts were reasonable and similar to other hotels we had stayed in on this trip.","34174":"Once found ( cannot get a car close and parking is a nightmare) the welcome by the staff was minimal. The rooms were well appointed and the hotel had considerable charm. Vast number of restaurants nearby.\nBreakfast was modest and unimaginative. I would not return.","34176":"We only had one night in this excellent hotel, and wish we had more. We had the room at the top, with a private patio with a water view. The room itself was spacious, with a sitting area and kitchenette separate from the bedroom. It was wonderful to come back after a day of walking to relax with a bottle (or two) of wine on the patio. Breakfast was fine, if a bit chaotic. Locationwise, nothing's more than a few minutes' walk away. We parked in the large public lot next to the exit from the island, it was a 5-10 minute walk at the most, and given the parking situation nearer to the hotel that seems like the best choice. Would definitely go back and stay in the same room!","34177":"This is hotel had everything you should ever want from a hotel.....and more. It is in a sensational location, right in the small Jewish quarter, in the heart of old Ortigia, in a setting of small charming streets within easy 5 minute walks of sea, fish market, cathedral and all of Ortigia;s other great sights. Our bedroom was gorgeous, romantic and had a wonderful view from its balcony. The breakfast buffet was exceptional in offering both 'anglo-saxon; and 'mediterranean' choices that were all delicious.....and it also had one of those Torta di Nona cakes that no-one but the Italians make (fantastically). And then, as if the great service, location, room and sleep were not enough, they have an ancient Jewish ritual bath carved into the rock of Syracuse beneath their hotel. Do go on a tour of these baths.....it is a small piece of history right there, just below breakfast!","34178":"Nestled on a narrow side street a short walk from the sea wall and adventurous wandering through similar streets offering shops and restaurants to satisfy your interests. What I enjoy most is the architecture and history. The hotel is immaculate with apartment style rooms on two levels. Very comfortable and inviting. The hotel is situated over the historic Jewish Baths. A generous continental breakfast is served daily.","34186":"Like stepping into a movie scene !\nHighly recommended !\nClean rooms, good breakfast, friendly staff and a beautiful atmosphere.\nRoom 3.5 (good for a 3 star Hotell)\nAtmosphere 5\nStaff 4\nLocation 5\n:thumbsup::thumbsup::thumbsup::thumbsup:","34187":"Residence Hotel Alla Giudecca overlooking the water need to be on upper levels very old and full of history like the discovery of the old jewish baptism water springs under the building dating back 1500 years Venture rooms are large comfortable air conditioned great little break area and surrounded by eateries in the streets the choice is overwhelming don't worry about the narrow street walking lanes yes you'll get lost but you fill find your way home WOW what a place friendly\nill go back","34189":"very good family hotel! Clean and fresh. Good with space and big plus for the living room with TV and kitchenette. The hotel is in a good area of the island located just above the Jewish bath.\n\nA bot boring breakfast in a hot dining room, but quite ok and I will be happy to return","34191":"Located in the historical centre of Syracuse, in a narrow pedestrian street the hotel is quaint, well preserved and with delightful historical features including some beautiful public rooms with some delightful historical pieces (including some first edition books).\nOur room had two rooms so there was plenty of space but it is decorated spartanly. the bathroom was acceptable. Breakfast was above average. The staff were acceptable but not overly helpful which in our opinion made them typically Sicilian. The hotel did arrange some valet parking for 15 Euros which was of great assistance. The car did re-appear the next day which was great. Getting to and from the hotel is a chore and we would recommend this hotel if you are staying more than one night.","34193":"We've stayed here for seven nights for a guitar camp (husband) and research trip (me). Staying in his hotel is like participating in a living history experience. It's an old palazzo, beautifully renovated (and I think they're creating a spa as I type), and full of exceptional architectural detail and beauty. Our room was an attic suite, comprised of a lounge and kitchen, a bedroom, bathroom and rooftop terrace. Wi-fi worked reasonably well, if sometimes slowly, and everything else was great. There's airconditioning in the lounge, which is a wonderful treat in the still mediterranean heat. Breakfast is served in a two-room restaurant (with modish plastic chairs that my poor backside didn't really fit on!), and is hams, cheeses, breads and mini-croissants, fruit, yogurt, cakes, cereal and fresh juices, coffee and tea. Staff are efficient and quite friendly. There's also a boutique. The hotel sits atop some of the most extensive and ancient Jewish baths in existence, which are outstanding, and only discovered in recent decades. I loved the whole experience of this hotel; it is unique, idiosyncratic, and an historic gem.","34195":"Our room was full of mosquitoes (despite being told by the man at reception that were no mosquitoes in the area). Unfortunately the mosquito nets had been removed from the bed. The bathroom was dark and very smelly with leaking units which presumably attracted the mosquitoes. In addition the sheets did not seem clean at all and we both suspected we had been bitten by bedbugs. The building is so beautiful it seems a shame that the standard of care and attention is so low.","34196":"This hotel was a great surprise with a main building that is centuries old and even has old baths under the hotel but it has traditional d\u00e9cor, balconies overlooking the roof tops and a tremendous amount of character in that the walls and ceilings \"reek\" of time and change. It is ideally located in the centre of the old town of the island of Ortygia and only a short walk from the main Duomo and its Piazza. Each room also has a small kitchenette in a cupboard which is a great blessing as one can tour the market and enjoy cooking the freshest food available with a good bottle of vino. There are no lifts however, so you may want the lower floor but the stonework, arches and architecture should impress at whatever level you are. Whilst we were there they put an ATM into one wall outside the front door - a great, if modern, addition. A bit tricky to find but once there, it is very central and easy.","34197":"Excellent location in historic surrounding. Very spacious room which is actually a suite \/ small apartment with separate bed and living room with a small kitchenette (which we did not use however) on the 1st floor of this historic building. Wi-fi worked well in our room in the main building. Good value for money.\nOn the negative side; cleanliness borderline and basic furnishing of room. Bathroom unpractical, hardly any space to put any toiletries including shower cabin. Guided tour to the jewish bath at the hotel's location and noise from these hourly tours in the room. View from the room was either interior or no view which was however ok and is partly owed by the historic surrounding.","34199":"As other reviewers have said, the residence now overflows to many other similar properties in the nearby streets. Given the scale of this expansion the likelihood of being located in the original property are reduced. This means less facilities, a walk to breakfast and in our case two other problems. The security gate to our apartment is not working so our rooms are accessible from the street, The internet, which is barely adequate in the main block, is non existent in the annexe we are in. In both cases management have been informed at once but after 24 hours there has been no action. Other members of our party report broken bathroom fittings and inadequate hot water.\n\nIt is a pity such a charming location is inadequately managed - as a seasoned traveller I could not recommend this place.. They seem to have grown far beyond their ability to manage their property.\n\nThe rooms are basic but charming, in buildings all probably more than 300 years old. The furnishings basic and of the period, and the facility really is very appealing, apart from the problems I have related. The unresponsiveness and disinterest of the front of house staff is the most disappointing aspect, on top of the issues I have mentioned.","34203":"I stayed three nights in one of the apartments facing the inner courtyard. Apartment is fairly simple but decorated with quality materials, e.g. moroccan rugs.\nI really felt myself very comfortable, a great place to rest after long days. The bed was very good, everything was very clean - and I loved the calm atmosphere. Very suitable for a light sleeper.\nI also saw my colleagues room which was a suite on top floor - very beautiful!\nIn the common areas I really appreciated the quality antique furniture and rugs, very tastefully decorated. Also the inner courtyard was very lovely. It was now after winter little bit in a dusty mode, but it is easy to imagine how beautiful it is in the summer.\nAll that being said, it was very disappointing and sad to see how much plastic they used: e.g. in the bathrooms there were plastic cups, also at the breakfast. I asked for a proper glass to drink my water\/ juice but I was told it is not possible. It is in such a contradiction with the sophisticated feel at the hotel, and mostly at this time of the world it is shameful, I think. I hope you will follow the world trend of reducing the use of plastic to as little as possible.","34204":"The hotel is charming and the young woman at front desk very accommodating and friendly The maid service was \u201clight\u201d\u2014 bed barely made and trash not removed. The hairdryer only blew cold air. The island of Ortigia is lovely with interesting shops, excellent restaurants, thriving open air market \u2014Parking can be a challenge","34220":"Good breakfast - a variety of products to choose from: sweets, ham, eggs, fruits. Ordered coffee better than the one from buffet (but we were asked if we want it only one day). Our room was very clean. We got information about sightseeing at the reception desk.\nOn the other side, only one elevator was working and once even non of them. No view from the room - some stairs leading somewhere and stealing the light coming to the room. Parking possibilities limited - either driving in the area for quite a long time to find free parking spot (unless you come in the evening and not in tourists season peak) or pay 15 - 18 EUR for parking. I would also say that hotel is rather strong 3-star than 4-star place.","34222":"Located in a side street just before the bridge to Ortigia, i strongly recommend it. The rooms are spacious and comfortable. It is a short walk to the main attractions. It offers an expensive but much needed laundry service. Back the same day. The service is excellent and the buffet breakfast includes bacon and eggs!","34223":"I really like this hotel, great rooms, fantastic breakfast spread and lovely staff.\nJust a couple of tweeks and this hotel would be excellent: The air-conditioning only just coped, plastic cups everywhere - bathroom, bar and breakfast room, could do with tea\/coffee making facilities in the room. The hotel is a 10 to 15 min walk to the island of Ortigio where all the tourist stuff is but the hotels surrounding neighborhood has great cheap tavrens, restaurants and bars.","34233":"The hotel is centrally located in a palazzo between the main streets Via Malta and Corso Umberto 1. It is very easy to access Ortegia island by foot as well as the Parco Arceologico della Neapolis.\nOur room was big and clean and the bed was comfortable. Only negative issue was that the room was located towards Via Malta, there was noisy traffic basically all night long. Tip, demand a room at the courtyard side!\nThe breakfast was good, especially the selection of pastries. The coffee in the pot was only warm, not hot. But you could ask for a cappuccino and that was good.","34245":"Modern and up to date hotel in central Siracussa. Very Good location near Ortigia, Big rooms, good beds, good and modern bathrooms, very good quality for money.\nI absolutely reccomend it. It is better than it seems in the pictures.","34246":"The Alfeo is an elegant building with a noble fa\u00e7ade and an attractive internal courtyard. Our room was spacious and the bed was very comfortable. The bathroom had a strange problem - the shower was designed to have a fixed screen and a sliding door. It had a screen but no door, so, try as one might, water shot out across the floor. There were signs of leakage around the base of the shower, roughly repaired, and the shower tray felt unstable. The breakfast buffet was extensive, and catered for all tastes, though the orange juice was rather acidic and the coffee was not pleasant - fortunately a much more drinkable cappuccino was readily available on request. The lounge was sombre, with armchairs arranged in rows as if in a care home. The hotel is just off Corso Umberto, a short walk from the island of Ortygia in one direction and from bus and train stations in the other.","34248":"The Alfeo is situated most conveniently, just off a main street, and about equidistant from Ortigia and the train and bus stations. Lots of restaurants within a few minutes walk. Our room was well appointed and spacious; modern shower\/WC, very comfortable beds. The staff in Reception were friendly and helpful and our room was always kept sparkling clean. Some of the Common Parts a bit tired but quite acceptable. Probably our only criticism was Breakfast which was not up to the 4 star rating. Service a bit erratic, poor cooked dishes and mediocre fruit juices. This could all be greatly improved by fresh fruit juices, a coffee machine and a proper facility for keeping eggs and bacon hot. Having said that, there was generally a good selection of all the usual fare. Overall a pleasant week's stay.","34253":"This hotel had a perfect location near to Ortigia, but without the hustle and bustle of the island itself.\n\nThe room was very clean and tidy (the cleaners even folded our clothes, which was a little weird but a nice touch).\n\nThe breakfast was maybe our favourite of all the hotels we stayed in Sicily. There were lots of sweet desserts including some great canolli. There was also free granitas in the lobby - a small thing but so good after a warm day of walking.","34264":"Have just returned from fabulous veg nights at the Alberto Alfeo. It is ideally situated for the island of Ortigia - a five minute walk. Although no parking, we managed to get a space on the street outside without any problem. On check in, the male receptionist was not very friendly - my Italian is a bit rusty but he didn\u2019t help me out. Anyway, Alessandro was a gem - very mannerly and helpful. The hotel is typical Italian and our room was fab. Very large and spacious with a jacuzzi bath which was great. Breakfast was nice howeve the restaurant was closed most nights although we ate out every night anyway in Ortigia. Overall, this hotel is fabulous if you\u2019re visiting the Old town I would definitely recommend it.","34269":"Five minutes walk from Ortygia the old island 'heart' of Syracuse and ten minutes in the other direction from bus and train stations. Very friendly reception, rooms immaculately clean and outstanding spread on offer at breakfast.\nOnly drawbacks were that 3rd floor rooms have roof-top 'viewing platforms' rather than balconies, access to which is via what looks like a Fire Exit; and although the hotel has a bar and a restaurant, opening hours tend to be rather random.","34271":"This hotel is centrally located and is clean with spacious rooms by European standards. Two blocks from Old Town and middle of shopping district. Public parking one block away and cheap. Room had a few minor running water issues. Has a restaurant and friendly staff but do not recommend. All our dishes were very salty. Too many really good restaurants around. Worth the stay.","34275":"There were many nice aspects to this hotel. Our first impression was the generous size of the room with a small lounge area on entry. The walk-in shower was much appreciated as we admired the smart tiles in the bathroom.\n\nBath robes, slippers, tissues next to bed were only some of the special touches.\n\nBreakfast was very good with considerable variety including another flavour granita.\nIn the lounge area, adjacent to reception, one could help oneself to a refreshing lemon granita. I encourage other hotels to copy this!\nWe were very happy with this hotel.","34276":"Stayed for a week. Rooms have lots of space but little storage room. Showers on the small side. Breakfast was good, plenty of fresh fruit, despite some other reviews, pastries galore! Compared to other 4* it was on the lower end but it was fine for what we wanted. Beds comfortable, WiFi excellent. All in all a good stay","34277":"3* is coming from a 5* for Alessandro at the reception and the location and a 2* for all the rest.\n\nLocation is perfect, just in the main road 5 mins away from the entrance of Ortigia. If you have a car there\u2019s a big parking just 3 mins walk away.\n\nCheck in experience was not that good the guy was not having patience even to explain few things for us, he gave us a map and then manage yourself!\nWi-Fi is very very weak in the room, it keeps disconnecting, I called to inform them but nothing happened.\nThe room is spacious but sort of empty and outdated, bed and pillows super uncomfortable, hairdryer is very old model, the one with the long tube, they don\u2019t have slippers in the room, they don\u2019t provide coffee or tea facilities in the room, they don\u2019t even provide a complimentary water in the room, they don\u2019t have bathrobe, there are 2 safe box and both of them not working (we had to call the lady to reopen one and then it was not working anymore)\nThe building is old and outdated with broken dirty carpet around.\nBreakfast has a good selection of pastries.\nThen the day before leaving we had the luck to meet Alessandro at the reception which completely turned the overall super bad in something a big less bad...he is very professional! While the guy in the morning advised us to give the car to park to some sort of private garage he instead showed us a big public parking closed by, he showed us also the complimentary granita they offer to client, he is very professional, guest oriented! Thank you Alessandro!","34294":"Nice place on the water in Ortigia. Well-furnished rooms. Rooftop breakfast buffet. In easy walking distance to everything on Ortigia. Nice gathering place on first floor. Quiet location. Accomodating staff.","34295":"We had a large room with an absolutely huge picture window facing the sea. The view was fantastic and the location convenient for walking Ortigia. There is a great view of the city and sea from the rooftop terrace where breakfast is served. The breakfast buffet itself was very good, with a nice variety of dishes. Our room was a little tired and needs some extra attention. The medallion on the ceiling was broken in half and the curtains were dusty. There is a drop celing when you first enter the room, and the ceiling tiles there were misaligned, giving us a view in to the crawl space between floors. My husband was able to straigten those. Yes, we could have called maintenance but we didn't want to wait around. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was nice with an interesting shower surround. I feel that with extra cleaning and a few repairs, this would be a much better room.","34303":"My best friend and I stayed there for two nights. It was an impressive, clean, charming hotel. We had a balcony room overlooking the water in a slightly secluded corner of Ortigia. It was the perfect spot, easily walkable to all Ortigia spots.The staff was friendly and helpful. Would absolutely recommend.","34304":"We stayed three nights in this hotel. In\u0131ta\u015fly we booked another hotel but Hotel Livingston has a nice view so we decided to change the hotel. The staff was very friendly and helpful, they booked tranfer for us and recommended nice restaurants. Breakfast was good with a lot of choice.","34313":"We had a great room with a balcony overlooking the sea, the room was decorated in period times. Service was nice and friendly and they had a valet parking attendant which was great! Location was ideal, we could walk everywhere, explore all the little alley ways, window shop, have drinks in cute bars. Hundreds of restaurants to choose from depending on your taste and budget. Room was a nice size, great free wifi, breakfast was on the top floor with an amazing view of the sea.","34318":"Adequate room, breakfast was pretty reasonable also. Check in and out process was straightforward. Had a minor issue with getting charged twice for the room, but that was resolved eventually.\nAll in all, an underwhelming stay.\nDisliked \u00b7 Couldn't get rid of the smell of toilets and pipes. Fairly unpleasant.","34320":"We had a very pleasant stay at maison Ortigia, though there are a few points to be looked after, floor of the room was not at all cleaned before we arrived, there was a lack of toiletpaper so we had to use paper handkerchiefs, the warm water boiler fell off several times, so there was no warm water to take a shower, breakfast was average, but we didn't leave hungry. This said, we certainly would come back, these are details easily to be fixed, the room was very nice and spatious, the staff very friendly and helpful, after all we had a wonderful time at maison ortigia!","34321":"The Maison\u2019s location is marvellous. Room is very spaceful. Bed could be more comfortable. TV has no foreign channels. Breakfast is good. Very kind stuff. Parking lot is under the building. Waze or Google maps has not a proper direction.","34329":"I have rarely booked a hotel where the staff was so kind and helpful.\nThe sea view from the bedroom is stunning.\nAnd the comfort of the room is all what you wish for.\nI would highly recommend this place!","34334":"The maison ortigia for me it's amazing, good staff, good breakfast and the rooms are really clean, i suggest to go there for your holiday because it's a nice place in the centre of ortigia really close to a lot of old buildings","34337":"location difficult to find, but it's good. Communication easy even with whatsapp. Room is small but clean and has all. Breakfast can be improved with some more fresh vegetables or other fresh things, like fresh juice.","34341":"Friendly helpful staff, great location and excellent value. We had Room 3 which contained 2 x double bedrooms, an en suite bathroom and a balcony overlooking the square for only 61 EUR per night (incl. taxes). We also arranged airport transfers through the hotel. Everything as described and arrangements went without a hitch. Happy to recommend.","34342":"Very clean rooms in a good location, with a very good breakfast. The a\/c in one of the rooms seemed not to function well. I asked for on-site parking at 15\u20ac per night and confirmed twice but when i got there they told us to park in public parking so we had to walk about 10 minutes with the luggage. A little disappointed about that but overall I would recommend without hesitation.","34351":"perfect holiday, Maison Ortigia is the best hotel in which I stayed in Sicily. The breakfast is delicious, cannoli and homemade jams delicious.\nThe view from the room is fantastic.\nVery useful parking.\nRecommended","34358":"Nothing special. Super ugly building. Room was clean and staff friendly. Location ok but details horrible. No toilet paper dying plants or plastic flowers. Cheap fake aquarium, shutters broken, breakfast average but poor if considering you are in Sicily.","34360":"Modern, comfortable. Location is great! Facilities are very good. The balcony is magnificent: perfect for having a glass of wine with a view on the cathedral and the square. The bathroom is spacious. Communication with hosts was easy. The only complaints: a foot towel and at least some hangers in the bathroom , please.","34370":"Excellent welcome from very accommodating staff (Valentina is a gem \u2013 she did everything she could to make our stay great!) This place has onsite parking with easy access for drivers only 15EU per night - so easy for drivers. The rooms are clean and pleasant with very comfortable bed and furniture, good water pressure and temperature in showers once the water gets going, convenient lift, sufficient plugs, quiet street, great breakfast (only area for improvement is that hot food items would be nice.) We stayed two nights and this was THE perfect location for exploring Ortigia. Great value for the price.","34373":"We booked the B & B as we wanted to be in the centre of the old town. Great Parking at the B & B but you have to pay for the parking and the room cost was \u00a3125 per night, so I think this should be free. The room was great we had a suite which had 2 balconies. The shower was nice and large. Breakfast was good also all items were cold i.e. just a buffet and I think that this could be better due to the price of the room. The staff were very friendly. There is a lift so you do not have to carry your bags up stairs.","34374":"We stayed at this lovely, modern B&B for three nights. The service was superb, Valentina needs a special mention - very efficient and always friendly. It is located well within walking distance from all the sights on the island and an early morning walk around the island (about 4.5 km) to start the day is most enjoyable. It makes a good central base from where to visit Noto\/Ragusa\/Modica. We stayed in Tre Corone and enjoyed having a glass of wine on the balcony at night and watch the locals catching up before turning in for the night. The adjacent parking area is well worth the daily rate. We enjoyed early morning cappuccinos across the road at Cafe Bar Mignon where locals have an espresso to kick-start the day. Keep in mind that only cash is accepted to settle the final bill. I definitely recommend a stay at I Santi Coronati.","34386":"We stayed two nights here, perfect location, 5 minutes walk to Apollo\u2019s Temple. Parking beside th building was a plus!!! Valentina has been super\nHelpful together with the rest of the staff. Breakfast in the terrace, very good and varied. Highly recommended!!!","34396":"I stayed three nights at I Santi Coronation B&B. The pluses were a nice room, free parking, a good breakfast and location. The minuses were the small decrepit elevator, the limited front desk hours, and the fact that they were not too generous with soap and toilet paper. Just be proactive if you need something and you will enjoy your visit.","34398":"This was a really central place, in the middle of everything. Our room was very nice - comfy bed, very clean, nice touches, and looked out into a very quaint courtyard. The staff were all very friendly and helpful. Two small problems though. One, we didn't have hot water either of the two nights we were there - -they said they were fixing it but it was still not pleasant to take cool showers. And two, we were in a room next door to the kitchen where they prepared the breakfast, so at 7:30 both mornings, there was quite loud clanking of dishes and people talking in the hallway, so it wasn't possible to sleep in. If you can request a room in a quieter location with hot water, it's a good place though!","34400":"We spent 3 nights and days in the hotel. Great location close to all the attraction, to the beach and restaurants.\nThe staff was helpful, we had a great room.\nthere is a good free parking and in this area this is a great ++.\nI have Celiac and in Breakfast they spoil me with free gluten bread and cakes.\nwe recommend to visit Ortigia and stay in the hotel.","34401":"he location of this place is perfect right in the middle of Ortigia which is so much cleaner than Syracuse and its close to all the restaurants, swimming spots and sites. The B&B also has a lift which after many weeks of lugging furniture up multiple stairs was fantastic and also free parking out the back. It was easy to find by car although google maps does lose it a bit in the smaller lane ways. The breakfast was one of the best we had on our trip with such a large variety of fresh fruits and pastries and also other things that varies each day.\nOne issue was that our particular room had really high ceilings giving it an air of spaciousness but with that came a lot of noise from the apartment upstairs. The people upstairs obviously had a dining table and chairs which they moved a lot so sleeping in was difficult and the scrapping nice went on till sometime 11pm at night so if you get a chance make sure you don\u2019t get the Gargallo room or make sure you ask for one that is quiet.","34402":"We had a great stay at I Santi Coronati. The staff were extremely helpful and the manager greeted you at breakfast and advised he was available in his office for any assistance. Having parking and your own remote control was great and provided flexibility. The location is fantastic and we were able to easily walk around and get to all the sites. Breakfast on the terrace was basic but certainly adequate. They were very accommodating with our early departure. We had no issues. Would definitely stay again.","34403":"B&B I Santi Coronati is a 12 room property right in the middle of Ortigia that is secure, charming and well run by Giuseppe who takes great pride in his property. Rooms are spacious and quiet, the bed and bedding just wonderful, the bathroom is clean and well appointed. Breakfast is on the third floor terrace overlooking the town and further out, the sea. Giant awnings protect from the early morning sun and the tables are set when you get there. Have a seat, and enjoy a good selection of local breakfast items. One morning there were tiny arancini. Another day, a tray of tiramisu. Rolls, hard boil eggs, yogurt, pastries, fruit. All there. There is an elevator, and parking in the rear. This is a B&B that is more like a hotel, but priced for a B&B. A few steps away, you'll find the Fontana di Diana and the great HOP on HOP off bus that for 5 Euros will take you all over Ortigia all day long. Dozens of places to eat are nearby. You cannot go wrong at this great place. I would return in a heartbeat.","34406":"I Santi Coronati is just excellent. Spacious and beautifully decorated rooms, very high ceilings and exposed stone wall features. Very comfortable bed with nice balconies. Breakfasts on the roof top terrace just a delight. Staff very friendly and very helpful on all matters. Location is excellent, close to shopping, Restaurants and swimming platforms and in a lovely street with lots of chatter and a great coffee shop just opposite.\n\nOverall an excellent B&B in all respects. Ciao.","34408":"This was a very nice bed and breakfast that bordered on a hotel for all the amenities. The location is extremely convenient to everything on Ortigia\u2014nothing is more than a 10-minute walk. The rooms were spacious, clean, and comfortable, with good air conditioning. Free parking in a private gated lot right behind the hotel was a real advantage. WiFi didn\u2019t work during our stay, but the clerk apologetically said the phone company was making repairs. Otherwise this was a nice place to stay right in the middle of the historic center of Ortigia.","34410":"The location is amazing, in the center of Syracuse, 5 minutes from Duomo with private parking, good breakfast and very kind staff.\nThe room was awful though: extremelly small, with window view to the garage wall, air conditioning pointing directly to your face, wi-fi working only outside the B&B. Definetely overpriced for what it was - 100 euro\/night is a lot for that room and services.\nif you have any other choice, choose it, or pay 60 euro more for a decent room.","34415":"We got the 1-bedroom suite for two nights near the end of our three weeks in Italy. It was great to have so much space!\n\nThe bedroom had a desk, wardrobe, small table and two chairs that were \"hobbit\" sized, so just right for me! The living room was similarly sized with two comfy sofas and more desks plus a fridge and a kettle as we had requested. The decor is eclectic, minimalist modern--not terribly pleasing aesthetically (a cow rug in the living room?).\n\nBoth rooms had a small terrace overlooking the street. The bathroom was modern with excellent counter space and towels. There was a step up to it which was awkward in the middle of the night. Breakfast on the roof was fairly basic, with the usual fruits, meats, cheeses, cereal, breads.\n\nLocation is terrific: quiet but just around the corner from the Piazza Archimede and easy walking to everything (highly recommend dining at Gran Caffe del Duomo across from the church!). It took us about 30 minutes to walk to the archeological park. We took a hop-on\/hop-off bus back (5E all day per person!).\n\nCheckout is early, 10:30, but they held our bags as we awaited our 12:30 departure. Nice service from three different folks including owner Giuseppe. Excellent value stay!","34416":"This B&B is highly overpriced. We got a tiny room with a window onto a drive in to the parking area. The remote control for the TV didnt work. The breakfast was very mediocre. Location is very good but thats about the only thing going for this place.","34417":"From the moment we arrived through to checking out after 3 days everything about this property was fantastic. We were driving and found it easy enough, parking was a real bonus given the properties central location on a quite road. Giuseppe and all of the staff were so friendly and helpful it really made our stay in what proved to be our favourite place on our Sicilian tour. Only rating this as Excellent as there is no higher rating option, thanks for making our stay so pleasurable.","34418":"Lovely B&B with very upscale well appointed rooms in a modern apartment building). We drove and getting there is a challenge with ortigias twisting streets (At several instances our driving app had us going down pedestrian alleys requiring restaurants to pull in chairs so we could pass). It is one of the few B&B with their own parking so a plus. Breakfast buffet is on the rooftop garden very lovely with a nice view. We shared the family room which was a large one bedroom with two couch\/beds in the living room. Spacious and clean. Unfortunately we only spent one nigh but thoroughly enjoyed the vibe.","34419":"Location can hardly be bettered, right in the middle of Ortigia and with car parking right next door. Rooms are large, bright and airy, very nicely fitted out and with comfortable beds. Breakfast up on the roof terrace was excellent and a great way to start the day. All rounded off by friendly, helpful staff.\n\nOrtigia is a fantastic place to visit and it would be hard to better this B&B to stay there.","34421":"We loved our stay here. The b&b is located on the upper floors of a building. Our room was sleek and modern -- totally comfortable. The sites of Ortigia were just steps from the front door. The reception is only open for a few hours in the afternoon and in the morning, but is friendly and helpful and well informed. We were directed to a drop-off laundry a 10-minute walk away that washed, dried and folded our clothes for less than 10 euros. The breakfast is served on a rooftop terrace and was quite delicious -- fresh baked goods, fruits, meats & cheeses. We highly recommend I Santi Coronati.","34425":"Firstly, the staff were very helpful and friendly. We left a scarf in a nearby restaurant and they retrieved it and are sending it to us.\n\nRoom was lovely, very clean.\n\nBreakfast was good too.\n\nWorth noting that it is a B&B, not a hotel, so at some times there may be no staff around. That was no issue for us.","34426":"I spent 4 nights in this cute B&B during my business visit to ortigia , it has a super location, I was upgraded to a balcony room which was much appreciated , and i totally I loved it , it was a tiny balcony overlooking the street and soon it became the meeting point of all my working group who were staying in different other locations in ortigia . The room was very clean and tidy , and breakfast super fulfilling with daily specials , Unfortunately the weather was too cold to have bfast on the roof terrace.\n\nBed was a bit hard and the pillows too soft , could be improved although the room does not have a safebx but it was super safe to leave everything in the room ( pass , money , laptop etc)\n\nStaff super friendly and friendly especially Lorenzo who was a total sweetheart and got out of his way to help starting with arranging and following the reservation , to helping with luggage and finally recommending the most wonderful restaurants , bars and hidden gems of the city which not only me as I Santi Coronati guest enjoyed but also my whole business group . Huge thanks to him .","34431":"We spent 2 nights here and were very pleased with everything. Giuseppe and Adriano were very friendly and helpful, their recommendations about places to eat were spot on. We had booked the cheapest room and on arrival we were offered the opportunity to upgrade to a very large suite for a modest supplement. We didn't take up the offer because our room was perfectly nice, big enough, very nice bathroom, spotlessly clean, but it was nice to have been offered the option, if we had wanted views and a little private balcony. Location is perfect, secure parking a massive bonus in a place like Ortigia. Excellent breakfast with different fresh produce and bakery products every day. Highly recommended!","34433":"Just returned from Italy and had very nice stay at I Santi Coronati. Very nice, comfortable, very clean room. Great to have on site parking. Owner v. helpful with planning for Siracusa. Ideal location to visit Ortigia. Highly recommend.","34434":"We stayed four nights at I Santi Coronati. It is in a perfect location in the heart of historic Ortigia. The private on-site parking is a real bonus and access in and out is quite straightforward given the location in the narrow one way street system of the old town. Our room was beautiful - very spacious, well equipped and tastefully decorated. We also had a small balcony with a table and chairs overlooking the street below. The staff were extremely helpful with restaurant recommendations and bookings. The rooms are spread over several floors but there is a lift. A lovely breakfast was served on the roof terrace except on one morning when there was a thunderstorm. It's a fantastic place to start the day. Highly recommended.","34441":"My wife and I stayed here for two nights in mid-September, \u201817. It is in a great location on a quiet side street, an easy walk to Archimedes Square, Duomo Square, and all sights except for the Greek Theater. Despite being right in the heart of the historic quarter, the hotel offers secure off street parking, which we found to be a real plus. The I Santi Coronati is housed in a refurbished 1800's multi-story building, with the reception on the 1st (U.S. 2nd) floor.\n\nOur room #1 was right by the reception desk, but was very quiet. It was a huge 2-room suite, entered through the large lounging room with a desk, 2 sofas, a dresse, and a mini-fridge and hot water maker. The bedroom was also very large with a high ceiling, a low comfortable king-sized bed, night stands, armoire (no safe). The decor in both rooms was Euro-modern and stylish.\n\nThe very large bathroom was attractive as well, with stone vanity, large shower, and a storage stand for toiletries. The modernization had led to a couple of downsides, however \u2013 there were a few mold spots in the shower, and guests were requested not to put paper in the toilet. Given the rest of hotel\u2019s positive features these were not deal breakers for us.\n\nBreakfast during good weather (which we had) was served on a pleasant third-floor terrace. It was quite good, with a selection of juice, yogurt, pastry, boiled eggs, and & cheese, coffee to order.\n\nThe I Santi Coronati is a very good base for exploring Syracusa and offers terrific value for the level of accommodations provided. We recommend it highly.","34444":"This B&B is smack in the middle of Ortigia with free parking for your rental. Lorenzo gave us amazing food recommendations and we were very happy with our room. Both of us agreed we would definitely stay here again!","34445":"We only stayed one night in this historical building, which is located right in the centre of Syracuse. The rooms are located on various floors within the building and you can either walk between the floors or use the small lift.\nOur room was clean, spacious room and had all we needed, including tea\/coffee making facilities.\nA very tasty breakfast was provided in the dining room.\nFree off-road parking was provided.\nHighly recommended.\nHighly recommended.","34447":"We had a spacious room with high ceiling, comfortable bed, table and chairs as well as an electric kettle. We arrived before 3 pm check in time so sat outside at a cafe and had some lunch until checkin time. The hotel's location is perfect, in a quiet street close to central squares and shopping. We had a little balcony as well. Staff are very friendly and very helpful, always welcoming and willing to help.","34463":"A lot of noise, cafeteria closed (this is not \u00e0 BandB but only a bed). The staff did'nt want to refund our breakfast...The Room wasn't soundproof. It's such a pity because the flat is well locatif....","34464":"our stay has been very pleasant, everything was very clean, Mario is a very kind person and that has always been available to clarify any doubts, of course its ever we return to Sicily specifically to Syracuse without any doubt we will try to stay in this establishment, a super 10 in everything","34465":"Great little B&B.\nIn the heart of town.\nReception is always manned during the day,which helped a lot.\nThere is parking on the street,but hard to get.\nWe found free parking in a Marina nearby and walked to the hotel.\nNice helpful staff at reception,room was clean and adequate.\nWIFI was good,as was breakfast in a restaurant a few doors away.","34470":"Nicely appointed rooms in a great location in Siracusa. Enter the rugged wood doors on street level of one of the town\u2019s many streets and walk up a marble staircase to Nostos, a modern boutique hotel with nice rooms and good staff. Location is great for touring both sections of the city. Note that breakfast is provided at a cafe down the block - great pastries, freshly squeezed OJ, wonderful coffee, and great service!","34471":"Unless you are very young and are traveling with only a backpack full of belongings, do not choose this place. There are 35 steep, marble steps and NO ELEVATOR to the first floor. Impossible for older people.","34472":"Our Loft room was spacious and we had bakeries, coffee shops, restaurants and a grocery store really close by! We were able to walk to everything. The bed was very comfortable and our kitchen had everything we needed. Great deal overall!!!","34473":"The b&b was very nice, our room was lovely and comfortable. Mario was very welcoming and helpful. The only downside was the paper thin walls and noise from the flat above us.\nIt is in a great location, just before you cross the bridge to Ortigia.","34474":"Nostos is a homey modern retreat on the tree-lined Corso Umberto I. Don\u2019t forget to duck your head as you step through the wooden access door over the archaic threshold into the entry hall leading to a courtyard and former stables in the back, and a grand marble stair leading to the piano nobile - converted into a grouping of minimalist and comfortable rooms.\nFree wifi, fast hot water, bottled water, easy check-in and very friendly and helpful proprietor. Fast (1-day) laundry service. Wardrobe with storage for luggage and clothes. Small fridge, coffee maker, a selection of teas. Excellent location in the historic center of Syracuse within a short walk to the island of Ortygia (only 10 minutes walk to the Piazza Archimede). Parking is available nearby (within 1-2 city blocks) either free (as available) or in a public lot on Via Bengazi. Breakfast is provided via sn arrangement with Caf\u00e8 Crisalva across the street and 30m east (about a minute walk).\nIf you have heavy luggage be advised there is no elevator.\nHighly recommend - you will only need a car to get to the Greek and Roman amphitheater complex (20 minutes drive).","34475":"A highly recommendable B&B in Italy. It will stay so when it is compared with other B&B's in Britain. People are kind and very informative around the B&B. Facilities are nice and well designed and organized.","34477":"Spacious bedroom, super-clean and carefully decorated ! Equipped with all facilities needed (bathroom and sealing courtesy kits and hair drying, information booklet )\nCentral located, the all ambience is quite and discrete ! Wonderful sea side and beaches at only 15\/20 minutes by car! Breakfast included at the affiliated bar whose bakery and coffee are tasty and fresh ! Perfetto!\n\nParking spot not available at the venue! Plenty of parking places in the surrounding but difficult to find during the morning time, due to massive traffic jam!","34483":"the owner is great, the rooms beautiful, nothing was a problem, good location, wonderful breakfast. when we arrived we had a complication, because we could not arrive on time. the owner made the phone all over the place, accommodated us without a problem and we talked very nicely. Thank you very much.","34484":"Very nice room, great location. Nice staff. Worth every euro. Would recommend it! Only no elevator, but they will assist you with your suitcases. Parking possible nearby in the streets or at parking place.","34487":"Perfect spot for exploring Syracuse and the surrounding areas. Situated in a typical old Italian building- the hallway is what to expect in Italy and mirrors many other charismatic properties-the rooms are extremely clean and practical, with a well stocked information area\/reception,hosted by the excellent Mario, who was a font of knowledge for our exploring. About 400 yards to the centre of Ortigia a gentle stroll in to town is easy. Likewise the short walk to the excellent Caportigia Hotel for breakfast is very relaxing- the breakfast and staff are second to none.\nWould definitely recommend although just one issue with our room which was very noisy when people were around with the front door, people on stairs and talking in reception sometimes a little aggravating. However still worth the highest score.","34488":"Everything was great: the location of the hotel is close to the main attractions of Ortigia, an excellent breakfast in a five-star hotel near the B&B Nostos, very friendly staff.\nBut several times, when someone was needed at the reception, nobody was there, which, unfortunately, reduced the overall favorable impression.","34489":"We had a superior double room which was just beautiful with a lovely balcony overlooking the Main Street. It was all with double glazed windows so it blocked out all the street noise. The bed was super comfortable and the room was spacious. The location was very convenient if you have a car. It is literally a 5 minute walk into Ortigia and there is some street parking which is free. You might have to drive around a little bit to find something with white lines nearby. If you choose to have the breakfast you will not be disappointed. It is a buffet breakfast at a restaurant in a very classy nearby hotel. I have never seen such an assortment of sweets and savouries. It was like having a buffet of high tea.","34490":"1, good location, free parking in the next street. 2, we were in room 107, spacious, ikea decor, cheap but very practical. Wifi is weak, not quite working, but it's quiet, because it's the far-far-away room. 3, I had no idea until I got the email telling me breakfast is not in the b&b, I don't like this idea. but it turns out fantastic! it's in a hotel 3 minutes away, buffet breakfast, lot of yum stuffs, best breakfast we had during this journey. 4, the staff received us is cold, isn't helpful answering my question. the one we meet the next day is a nice young guy.","34491":"The location was great, as the hotel is very close to Ortygia where all the action is. Plenty of street parking during off hours. Breakfast is at a nearby hotel, fantastic. Desk staff was very helpful.","34492":"Good Location, Beautiful Zone . The building where is the B&B Nostos need restauration in the starways and entry.\nThe room is modern and very functional, the solution they have adopted to place the bathroom inside the room for me is not the most appropriate, although it is complete and meets the expectations\nBreakfast is very, very good at a nearby hotel","34498":"Nostos Hotel is a lovely place, well decorated, comfortable and situated in a great place to move around Siracuse. Walking distance from good restaurants and lovely wine bars. We stayed two nights and I really think we should stayed longer as from Siracuse you can move and travel to many beautiful places nearby. Siracuse on it own it is well worthy to stay longer. Nostos Hotel is lovely, pity the entrance hall it is in a need of a tender loving care but when you cross the door of the hotel it is another thing totally different..., decorated with a very good taste and welcome by the very friendly and helpful staff. A wonderful buffet breakfast its served in a hotel near by, just two minutes walk, that belongs to the same owner. If one day I come back to Siracuse I will go again to Nostos","34499":"Great location. Priced appropriately. Outstanding breakfasts. Mario was a very friendly and Informative host. No complaints whatsoever! Good restaurants for lunch and\/or dinner within walking distance.","34501":"I stayed in a double bed apartment. It's newly furnished, so everything is new, modern and functional. The kitchen was well equipped. What's better, the breakfast was provided at a star hotel nearby, the food was good and the restaurant environment was enjoyable.","34502":"I stayed at the B&B Nostos mid November 2018. The location of this B&B is unbeatable. There's a great parking place two blocks away, late-night food close by and the island of Ortigia (old city) is very close. The room was very clean and nice: i liked the modern decor. The bed was nice and comfy. Same for the bathroom, although the shower was smallish (it is, however, big by Italian standards). The breakfast is a wonder. Despite the fact that it is no longer at the B&B, they've contracted with a hotel nearby that serves this magnificent breakfast with all kinds of delicious sweets and excellent coffee. We were very politely greeted and the young lady was very helpful. I enjoyed immensely my stay here and would love to stay here again if in Siracusa.","34503":"All was OK. Expectations were everpassed by the quality of the establishment in all the elements- Cleanless- Superb breakfast- Great location near of Ortiguia- Calm (some temporary works starting at 8.00 a.m. but not excessive noise)Only two minor things: Temporary works (see above) and no elevator (but rooms in the first floor)","34504":"Our room was very spacious and very modern. The bathroom was one of the best in all the places we stayed. We enjoyed how convenient it was both to Ortygia and to the municipal parking area just two blocks south of the B&B (parking there, by the way, was very reasonable in price, and easy to get to if you are driving a car). The breakfast was at a hotel a block and a half away, but it was really well done. We would highly recommend this B&B to friends.","34505":"A short walk from the bus & train stations, our room was generous & clean, perfect location, plenty of places to eat and drink in the immediate vicinity, a very short walk to the harbour and the waters edge, 4 night break, couldn't fault it, a great place to relax for a few days","34506":"The Nostos B&B is located in an old building, the conditions of which are not so appealing. The inside, however, is well docorated and the condition of the room is of very high standard. The location is midway between the railway station and old town, walking time to either is about 10 minutes. The archeological site is also walkable, at a greater distance about 20 minutes away.The inclusive breakfast is served in the restaurant of a nearby bontique hotel. The buffet breakfast is of very high standard and with many choices, not the usual Italian breakfast of conetto and pastry only.My only complaint is that during my stay I found some mosquitos in the room despite turning on the room air-conditioning. I managed to catch 3 but only after I was bitten. The toilet \/ shower room has no separate ventilation except the window, which I believe was the way-in of the mosquitos.","34507":"We very much enjoyed our stay at Nostos. If you don't mind a little walking, this is a great place to stay. Pros: very clean, staff is very helpful and welcoming, short walk to Ortigia and many sights, large and delicious breakfast buffet, Netflix and Amazon Prime in room Cons: 34 steps up, approximately 3 blocks to breakfast, no English TV","34509":"If you travelling by car , car space is a little problematic around the B&B .Nostos is in a busy area of Syracuse with a lot of bars and restaurants and Ortigia 5 min walk away is mostly pedestrian area. my wife and I purchased a daily ticket with the tourbus operators for 5Euro which will take you to the archeological sites and all places of interests","34511":"Our second time at B&B Nostos and we were so happy to be back. Mario looked after us very well.The rooms are spotless and very well sized. Breakfast at the Caportgia Hotel was a delight. There was so much to choose from.","34516":"The hotel was very well placed for the sites of Syracuse and was a great base for a fantastic holiday. Breakfasts were a particular highlight - they were luxurious, incredibly welcoming and a wonderful way to start each day.","34520":"I recommend! The loft is new, modern and very well located. You can park safely very close for 10 euros a day (reasonable). You can visit everything by walking which is enjoyable. A quick issue with the shower but I'm sure it will be fixed... Grazzie!","34522":"Small , charming B&B a few minutes outside the Island.Clean, nice rooms and very helpful staff. Bathroom modern very clean, very comfortable bed. We follow their recommendation of the Syracuse seeing and about food.","34540":"We ate here most nights have to agree with last reviews great food wonderfully cooked. Scillian cooking at its best I can't pick out anthing in particular as it was all so good wonderful tomato sauces on the pasta, lovely lasagne and the meat and fish dishes and of course the lovely desserts. Thank you to Federicka (hopefully I've spelt it right) mama and papa and not forgetting Bella and Gypsy for making a wonderful holiday even better. ps I wish I could take mama home with me.","34550":"We staid in agriturismo nearby and Villa Cristina restaurant was recommended by the receptionist . Went to the restaurant tree times and weren't disappointed. They offer set menu of simple yet delicious traditional Sicilian dishes (excluding beverages) for reasonable fixed price .\nWe have tried both: meat and fish . For the third evening we made a special order - sea food pasta and lobster ( not fixed price ) . It was great .\nFriendly stuff and homemade Limoncello made the dinner even better )\nThank you for your hospitality, send our best regards to Gypsy the cat .","34584":"Excellent breakfast and dinner offerings (all food produced on premises), which alas I could not enjoy having just been diagnosed with Celiac Disease. I was very envious of my husband and our two friends. But the ingenious Signora and her very pleasant staff went out of their way to accommodate me, finding versions of many things I could eat. Their own fruits, vegetables, jams and honey - all of which I could eat - were just delicious.\n\nPublic spaces were pleasant and rooms quiet and comfortable.\n\nThe signora very reasonably wanted to be paid in cash - not to avoid taxes but rather so as not to pay credit card companies impose.","34600":"This charming property offered simple, clean rooms and a friendly staff BUT the food was very blah, which was disappointing for a 22 euros diner meal per person, wine not included - a lot for Italy. As for the the wine it was very whatever. Also you have to go all the way to the parking to access the swimming pool and we only met with the friendly employees, never with the actual owners so nobody really explained us anything about the region. The breakfast was good and the location outside Syracusa is convenient but you still hear the main road. Overall I wouldn\u2019t stay there again because we have been to so much more welcoming agriturismos.","34625":"Well preserved historical building with a large garden and pool, which made our children very happy. In the evening we enjoyed great local food and wines in the company of the other guest and the very friendly owners. Great place to discover the cities and beaches of South-East Sicily.","34651":"We had a very nice cooking Class at this Agriturismo which also has rooms.We made a five dishes dinner. The teacher was the Owner Signora Silvana. The meal turned out to be very good, and we were served generously with wine. All ingredients was from the farm.","34665":"We stayed in this hotel 2 adults and 2 kids and my score per area is:\n\n- Room: very spacious, new and clean. However, it had no vindows which we missed to have more sunligth inside. 4 points.\n- Common areas: well maintained, very nice swimming pool and big and free parking area. 4 points\n- Breakfast: this is the weak point of this place. No fruits at all and every day similar set of cakes and salamies. 3 points.\n- Restaurant: the hotel offers and small menu of pasta dishes which are well cooked at a very good price. Just one recommendation, you have better to book your dinner, otherwise you will miss the best meals. 4 points.\n- Personal: they are nice, about all the family's father called Gino. He made our staying really nice. Thanks Gino! 5 points","34679":"My wife and I stayed at this wonderful place from 28th August to 6th September 2018 inclusive. It is ideally located to access the city of Syracusa , and surroundings. This area is rich in history, and therefore ancient site abound. It is also convenient to the beautiful baroque cities of Noto, and Ragusa, and the coast features some of the best beaches. what's not to like?\nWe stayed in room 9, which was converted with three other rooms from an old water storage tower. It was quiet, light and spacious. The en suite shower was spacious and well equipped.\nOn several nights the temperature was in excess of 26 C degrees, and were thankful for the air conditioning!\n\nNow the best thing about this place - Antonio and his parents who run the place, as well as grow the delicious oranges and lemons that surround the property. Antonio spoke excellent English, was helpful in all matters, couldn't do enough for his guests, and would cook you any evening meal you fancied with enough notice. We enjoyed the experience so much we elected to say in for half of our nights there. We miss him dearly already. The rest of the staff were all polite, friendly and genuinely keen to help.\nThe second best thing is the beautiful swimming pool, which is in well kept, never too crowded and when Antonio says use it anytime - he means it! We loved our stay, and will be back. The only suggestion I have to make is to improve the internet signal to facilitate use from the bedrooms. Thanks for making our stay special!","34691":"We stayed at Il Giardino di Sicilia for three weeks and cried when we left. The proprietors are wonderful, warm people, who treat their guests like family. It is a happy place....home away from home, except you don't have to cook or clean. Breakfasts are delicious. La Signora bakes beautiful cakes and there are always homemade jams. When we spent time by the gorgeous pool and stayed for lunch, if the grande cuoca was off, Il Dottore made a barbecue. One day his son, Angelo, who is an angel, made us a beautiful plate of Pasta alla Norma. Dinners were delicious, with an array of seafood, fishes, pastas and local wines. Valeria can cook! It is perfectly situated for day trips, being about 15 minutes to Ortigia, and short drives to Noto, the most beautiful beach, San Lorenzo, and mountain villages. The rooms and washrooms are modern, well equipped and spacious. The water pressure is better than at home. We also made great friends, We miss everyone already and cannot wait to return. I would give this a rating of more than 5 stars if I could!","34695":"As a family run business it's obvious their guests are important to them. The family and staff could not have been more helpful and friendly.\nOur rooms were spotlessly clean, spacious and tastefully decorated throughout. The pool area is beautiful and a perfect place to relax. We couldn't fault breakfast, the home made cakes were delicious , or the evening meal which is available on request.\nIl Giardino is situated in an ideal spot for local beaches and sightseeing. We would recommend an early evening trip to Ortygia - the sunset over the port is spectacular.","34698":"This is a wonderful holiday accommodation, centrally located in South East Sicily and within easy reach of many wonderful towns including Noto, Ragusa Ibla and a little further to Taormina. The accommodation is within easy reach of Syracuse which has plenty to offer families with numerous restaurants and fantastic architecture.\n\nThe Zito family were the perfect hosts, friendly, helpful and very accommodating. The breakfasts are wonderful, my daughter absolutely loved the Nutella wrap whilst the selection of cereals, meats, cheeses and hams was fantastic. The pool is amazing and the surroundings authentic. The accommodation also provides dinner on request and we used this facility twice and were really impressed, it was lovely relaxing without driving and enjoying the view of the pool.\n\nAll in all I couldn't recommend it high enough, clean, tranquil and beautiful with truly lovely Sicilian hosts....enjoy","34711":"I booked an apartment with 2 rooms after I paid the deposit was told it was not available but I could have one room instead I cancelled but my deposit was not returned\nThe photos in the ad do not identify the apartment so until you get there you do not what you will get, that is not an honest way to go about","34713":"This is a wonderful place to stay in every respect other than accessibility to restaurants in the evening. Our room was excellent, the swimming pool is probably the best we have ever experienced (bigger than most hotels), the family were warm and friendly and the breakfasts just superb, with lots of home made delicious goodies utilising things from the garden\/orchard. There's loads to do in the area above and beyond the obvious wonderful sights of Syracuse\/Ortygia - if you have time then go to the Vendacari and the superb beach at Calamosche, and go to the Pantalikon (Sunflower walks for both but you have to obey the no entry signs at the former, and ignore the officials and just get on and do the glorious walk at the ;latter). We were just a little stuck in the evenings as we found the roads a bit daunting at night(dark by 7pm in early Oct) and there is nowhere you can walk to find a restaurant. I would highly recommend this lovely place but suggest that you take one of the rooms with a kitchen - there is a large supermarket within easy reach. It helps but is not essential to speak Italian and if you have a little Italian then this family allow you to converse in it. You would do well to find anywhere that is better value.","34752":"The staff at Hotel Posta define accommodating! They could not have been MORE helpful. Driving and parking in Sicily can be challenging, especially for Americans, but you will get all the assistance you need from these extremely kind and patient people. The rooms are very clean, bathrooms are more spacious than most, hotel is within walking distance of everything, (historic sites, best restaurants that we experienced in Sicily, fun boat tours) and the outdoor rooftop terrace provides beautiful views for both sunrise and sunset! Do the Hop on\/Hop off bus tour to get around! We can't wait to go back!","34756":"The location of the hotel is really great, right after crossing the canal of the Ortegia Peninsula. The reception staff is young, kind and very helpfull. The first surprise that greeted us was the \"smallest\" hotel room we ever encountered (the same reaction came from the couple of friends who came with us).\nThe double bed in the center of the room (see attached pictures) filled about 75% - 80% of the room size and there was not much room to turn around. The second surprise was that \"there is no wardrobe\" and there is no bench \/ shelf where you can unpack your suitcase (except on the bed) and \/ or store your clothes. There is no connection between the pictures of the hotel rooms that appear on the hotel's website and \/ or Tripadvisor. The shower is quite small but it looked like it was recently renovated and apart from the size is quite good.\nThe next morning we found quite a few people in the dining room which we think stayed \"In another wing of the hotel\" that is located elsewhere in the building. I am guessing that \"in the other wing of the hotel\" are the hidden rooms that appeared in the pictures on the hotel's website.\nBreakfast was a meal with all the ingredients of a typical Italian breakfast. In conclusion if you are looking for a room, for one or maximum two nights and are not afraid of a small crowded room this hotel can suit you.","34757":"They couldn't have been more helpful - arranging our taxi back to the airport, getting us breakfast and much needed coffee early before we left. Away from the centre of Ortigia, by the bridges across to Siracusa. Old-fashioned but clean, air-conditioned rooms. We'd definitely recommend it.","34775":"For our first night we received a room on the ground floor, everything OK, apart from some traffic noise. We booked an extra night using hotels.com, same price. The reception though told us later \"We are fully booked\" we had to change to an attic room (lift to first floor, stairs to second floor, then yet an extra stair). We were sent to a room with 2 pieces, each with a bed of 1,20m. So impossible to sleep in the same bed, not even in a bed next to each other. This room though had a small window, with a limited view to the sea.\nA few days later we passed again in Siracuse and, as the hotel's location is just perfect, I booked again. Same price, so I hoped to get a room like the first night, but no, again an attic room. This time though with a larger bed, but a window with no view at all.\nBreakfast: it is a buffet; even if it is rather basic it still is OK, no more no less.\nParking: hotels.com mentions \"free parking\", but that is wrong: one must have much chance to find a free spot on that small free parking in the area. Also next to the hotel is an open air parking at 10\u20ac for 24hrs, there one will find some place.\nThe location of the hotel is just perfect: walking distance from the old centre and also the morning market is just one street away.\n\nMy feeling: the attic rooms are priced too high when compared to the other rooms.","34778":"Very convenient to Ortigia tourist attractions, boats, restaurants, and market. Staff is helpful, knowledgeable, and friendly. Facilities are clean and modernish. They'll do laundry but it's cheaper at a nearby laundromat, where they'll do the wash, dry, and fold for you. No complaints about the hotel at all!","34780":"Whilst we had a very sympathetic receptionist, we had the worst experience on our last night at the hotel. It appeared they did not have a night receptionist so doors were locked at 11.00pm and all guests had a key to the huge wooden door! On returning from a night out the door snapped in the door and we were unable to get in. Having called the mobile number as per the hotel signage, the lady at the other end was quite put out being disturbed in the night and reluctant to come out. After nearly two hours in the street from 1.00am she eventually turned up. Not even a sorry or how are you came out of her mouth! Instead her boyfriend turned on us in an aggressive, threatening manner! I stood my ground but was horrified at their whole attitude towards us. Bearing in mind in our group of six we had a pregnant lady and one who was struggling to walk they showed no care in the slightest. However, the lady, who turned out to be the manager, thought a 15% discount would make things right. Anyone wishing to stay at the hotel - think again. I certainly would not want anyone to experience what we did in the middle of the night. Not the sort of treatment I expected from the so called management!","34781":"This place is perfectly located - 2 min walk from the best area in Siracusa for walking, shopping and eating. We were at the Areas room right under the roof so felt like a Harry Potter vice but at the same time very spacious. The staff was very friendly and they recommended a great restaurant (see other review), called the place and made the booking for us.","34784":"Hotel Posta is more than perfect ! I can only good words about it :) very nice and helpful and smiling staff, first of all.\nVery convenient in Ortigia , close to the market and everything.\nVery clean and the breakfast was super good! I\u2019ll come back for sure .\nNoemi speaks perfect Spanish And will you make feel at home :)","34791":"Stayed for 5 nights, wonderful location right in the action but not noisy, wonderful markets across the road. Very clean room+plenty of room, however, bathroom was small and tight but excellent staff and all reception girls very friendly and helpful...good breakfast and coffee. Definitely recommend this Hotel","34795":"The Hotel is fine. Good location, nice room, excellent air con. Basic breakfast.friendly helpful staff. The large American Student contingent was beyond the control of the hotel, but the peace and tranquility of the place was spoiled by that. We would stay again.","34799":"The Posta has a faded charm which in some ways adds to its appeal.\nIts main plus though is its right in the heart of Ortigia and all the attractions are easily walkable from it.\n\nService was good - we arrived before check in and left our bags and they'd been delivered to our room by the time we returned.\n\nThere is a solarium with stunning views of the port.\n\nOur room was fine, nicely furnished however the shower only had a shower curtain so the bathroom floor could get wet if you weren't careful. Also my partner noticed a piece of wood with a nail sticking out of it in the bathroom.\n\nMy bedside shelf wasn't secured properly to the wall which meant it sloped badly downwards meaning if I'd put anything on it it would have rolled off. Not good.\n\nThe breakfast was the typical Italian fare. The orange juice though I have to say was fantastic.\n\nSo mostly good but with a few issues.","34801":"This is a lovely, small hotel. Just realize that having an elevator doesn't mean you can get yourself or your luggage to your room without stairs. The elevator goes up one floor, but then there is a flight of stairs if your room is on third floor. Ocean view room was nice but really was parking-lot view. Nevertheless, the place was relatively quiet, helpful staff, wonderful location a few short blocks from the daily outdoor market, and from the Apollo fountain, in the main tourist area of Siracusa (Ortiga). Good breakfasts too!","34807":"The hotel occupies a very convenient location on the island of Ortigia just across the bridge from Siracusa (Syracuse). The staff is very friendly and helpful. Wifi is good. Parking is available but not necessarily free. However, it is undersized in just about every aspect. We had a double room for 2 people and could hardly turn around. The bathroom was super small.","34810":"This was my third stay at Hotel Posta and by far the longest.I stayed 12 nights.I just love the building and the location is central.The views from the upstairs rooms are amazing and if you have a hire car there is free parking nearby.The smell of the breakfast is intoxicating each morning!\nOh how I wish I was there now!\nThe staff are more than accommodating.Nothing is too much trouble.Extra towels,information about the surrounding area and friendly hospitality is what they offer.Guilia,the new lady is a wonderful addition to their team!\nI hope to see you soon Hotel Posta!\nSpero che civediamo fra poco!","34812":"start with the host. what a lovely lady. extremely helpful and chatty. rooms were large with awesome deck and views. the dining area for breakfast etc also stunning. easy swimming from rocks at bottom of hotel. swim shoes provided. walk to town around 15 mins flat and easy. would stay here again in a heartbeat","34813":"Guiggiulena is truly amazing. The building is set right by the waterfront, with a small stone stairway right down into the water. Clear water with loads of fish to snorkle among.\n\nOur room was spacious, clean and tastefully decorated. The building could use a little maintenance here and there, but it was nothing that affected the overall impression.\n\nThe breakfast was the best we had in Sicily (stayed in three different places). Small but delicious and fresh buffet.\n\nOrtigia is a 20 min walk from Guiggilena, taxi was about 17 euros.\n\nThe hosts were super friendly and helpful, we got some great restaurant tips from Sabrina.\n\nI loved this place and would love to visit it again!","34814":"Spectacular views from the breakfast room \/ balcony and bedrooms (although I think there is one bedroom not on the sea side). Hosts and employees were super attentive. You have direct access to the sea at the ground level, if you are ok walking on rocks (they provide water shoes and towels). The terrace is also super nice. Nice shower in the room. It's a bit of a walk to central Syracuse \/ Ortigia or to the Roman\/Greek ruins (nearly a half hour) By the way, if your are taking a taxi, don't grab one from the street, ask in the B&B.","34815":"Giuggiulena has basically everything I want from a holiday experience.\n\nThe service is one of a kind. Sabrina and Mamadou really couldn\u2019t do more to make guests feel welcome and taken care of. The personal touch was in everything from we arrived until we left, with a sandwich to go for our early bus transfer to Palermo.\n\nNeed help with booking anything, adjust parasols, have a sun bed set up on the cliffs? They provide it. With a smile and a laugh.\n\nThe housekeeping was perfect. The time the lady took to make everything flawless in our room, bathroom and our private terrace, was something you don\u2019t necessarily experience on 5-star hotels.\n\nThe hotel itself is beautiful, with large windows overlooking cliffs and the sea. It only have a few rooms (nine?), so it\u2019s never crowded or noisy. It is a 15-minute walk from the centre of Siracusa. In addition to the opportunity to enjoy sun and swimming from a sun bed on the cliffs, they also offer a roof-top terrace, which we had to ourselves most of our 5-nights stay. Beach towels are provided for free.\n\nGiuggiulena will be my first choice for accommodation next time I go to Sicily.","34817":"A gem of a place! A very tranquil location with amazing views over the sea and lovely relaxing bedrooms - you\u2019ll fall asleep to the sound of the lapping waves. Sabrina is fantastic and very friendly - recommending restaurants and day trips. The breakfast is delicious - you must try the home baked flans, while sat taking in the splendour of the beautiful blue sea.","34822":"I cannot say enough about this little B&B. It is basic, clean and comfortable, and very well-located. Situated right on the cliff, our room had a wonderful view of the ocean and the town. We could also see the gorgeous sunrise from our little balcony. The breakfast is worthy of mention. One of the ladies who runs the Guiggiulena creates an amazing homemade breakfast spread - from oven-dried homegrown tomatoes to delicious egg flans and cakes. It was really something to look forward to every morning!","34823":"Cannot speak highly enough of this place, and Sabrina is absolutely wonderful. Fantastic breakfast and fabulous accommodation. Five stars for everything :). We were in the 2 bed apartment with sun deck which was just marvelous.","34824":"Giuggiulena was everything I hoped it would be... Classy, discreet, high level of service and extremely friendly staff in a stunning location. Thank you to Sabrina for making our stay so welcoming. We hope to stay again. Couldn't fault it!","34825":"From the moment you arrive it is clear that Sabrina and Claudia run Giuggiulena with a lot of love.This is as far as you can get from a faceless corporate chain hotel.The rooms are all individually furnished, quirky but comfortable (ours had its own private courtyard garden on the fourth floor)! Good showers, comfy beds but everything with a personal touch. Breakfasts are wonderful with homemade cakes,good coffee and fresh produce taken on the little balcony hanging over the sea and the rocks below. There is a great roof terrace with sunbeds and wrap around views. Sabrina is extremely helpful with information, restaurant advice, reservations, taxis and local history and is a lovely and kind person. We had a wonderful time and will surely return.\nPractical tips: there is a very nice restaurant about 5 minutes walk away with a lovely outside terrace and the bus stop for the hop on, hop off tourist bus is nearby.This is good for visiting the Greek\/Roman site and museum. Most of what you will want to see though is in Ortigia which is a good 20-25 minute walk away.The area is very safe. Taxi's are available, book with Sabrina,10 euro's each way.\nThank you villa Giuggiulena!","34826":"We\u2019ve just returned from a 7 night stay at Giuggiulena and it is one of the loveliest places we have ever stayed. Sabrina the owner, her sister Claudia and staff Mamadou and Alesia are delightful. Nothing is too much trouble for any of them. The place is spotlessly clean and well equipped. The beds are really comfortable and an excellent power shower in a spacious bathroom. We had a double room with balcony and the views are just breathless in full sunshine or a dramatic thunderstorm, you won\u2019t need to use the TV!! Sabrina is so helpful in suggesting places to visit and eat, you can contact her anytime for help or advice. She was also helping with my Italian learning - molto Grazie!! Claudia bakes amazing cakes for breakfast and she\u2019s very friendly, we were totally spoilt. We can\u2019t think of a negative comment, thank you so much and see you again.","34827":"The location and view surpassed my expectations. We visited on an unfortunately rainy day but the view and sound of the sea right next to us were still wonderful. The staff were all very helpful and kind. The breakfast was complete and plentiful. I would love to visit again. The inn is down a small street which makes accessing and parking difficult but Giuggiulena helped park our car for us! The inn is closed between 1 pm and 4 pm but that was clearly marked on our confirmation email (to respond to an earlier post).","34828":"The locale is fantastic. Stunning views of the sea. If you don\u2019t mind walking you can reach the old town or archaeology complex easily- about 30 minutes. If not you can catch the bus. Parking is available on the street nearby so we just stashed our car. The rooms are modern and comfortable. The breakfast superb and a lot. But what also distinguishes this facility are the friendly, generous and helpful hosts","34829":"I know I am raving, but this BnB was exceptional in every way. Having spent three nights in Ortigia at a sister establishment ( which was also fabulous) and then two in Modica, we had decided at the last minute to rather return to Siracusa for our last night rather than spending it in Catania before returning to Rome. A great decision and a the best place to have had our last night in Sicily! So, looking for accommodation at such short notice, we were grateful to be recommended to Giuggiulena where there was just one room available. Sabrina is a wonderful hostess who really cares about her guests. When you walk through the front door into the open plan lounge and dining area, all you see is the glistening blue sea right below the hotel. We were incredibly fortunate to have the room on the top floor which leads out onto its own large and secluded private terrace; the room itself is spacious and very well and thoughtfully appointed. Also on the top floor is the main terrace, which all guests can access, with 180 degree sea views. We loved sitting up there with a glass of wine watching the sun set. A swim in the Med was a highlight - tempted by the sight of the sea, accessed from the bottom floor and over a few rocks (booties are provided, and towels). Breakfast the next morning was exceptional: freshly home baked savoury and sweet pastries, fresh fruit, cheeses and hams - and great coffee. We didn't get to explore this part of Siracusa, given that we had less than 24 hours here, but it was a short walk to a very good nearby restaurant, also overlooking sea, which we visited for both lunch and dinner. We would love to have had more time to explore this area more, and would definitely want to stay here should we return to Sicily, as it is close enough to Ortigia and the old town and market by bus. Thank you for your great hospitality, Sabrina!","34830":"We stayed 3 nights mid-September 2018. Loved the room, the view, and the peacefulness! Sabrina and Mamadu are great hosts, who made us feel very welcome. The B&B offers parking in the garage in the alley across the front door. Our rental company gave us a rather larger car and we ended up parking on the main street, which was safe and where easy parking could be found. Breakfast is buffet-style, copious, and delicious, served on the balcony. Don\u2019t miss the sunrise (see photo)! Ortigia is a 20-minute walk away. We stayed at Giuggiulena B&B to be within the radius of Mount Etna, Catania, Noto, and Marzamemi in the south. Worked out really well! We had a great stay at Giuggiulena!","34831":"We had a fantastic weekend stay at Giuggiulena. After a long day exploring the surrounding area, we loved coming back to our beautiful ocean front room and having a swim in front of the b&b. The rooms are spotlessly clean, and the ocean front rooms have a fantastic terrace. The breakfast was delicious, and Claudia and Sabrina offered excellent suggestions for exploring nearby Ortigia Island. We are looking forward to returning soon!","34842":"Little things can tell you a lot. It sounds trivial, but the tissues in our room were themselves luxury items, superior in quality to anything I've ever had in a major city five-star hotel. This tiny item is significant because it reveals the forethought and careful attention to detail which is lavished on the rooms at Giuggiulena. Other reviewers have remarked on the beauty of the interiors, the friendly helpfulness of the owners and staff, the stunning views, the splendid breakfasts . . . These reviewers don't exaggerate. We'd return to this lovely place tomorrow if we could.","34926":"I will keep with me the excellent memories of my holidays in Ortigia.The kindness of the owners, the positive atmosphere of the B\/B made me feel like home !Breakfast was a feast! There was delicious warm homemade cake every morning !","34954":"A great find. Family run hotel with apartment style rooms. Lovely breakfast on the roof terrace served by Stephano. His help and advice has been very useful. He wants his guests to have a great visit. Spotlessly clean rooms, well equipped with kitchen and all amenities advertised. Hard to beat it.","34956":"Wonderful family-run B&B in the heart of old Ortigia, with easy-to-understand directions and parking. Cute rooms upstairs. Fabulous breakfast terrace overlooking the ocean with what has to be the best breakfast in Sicily. Fresh squeezed blood orange juice, grandma\u2019s fruit tart, father\u2019s homemade jams, scrumptious croissants. Stefano had great recommendations for sight seeing.","34961":"This place is fabulous in all aspects: the location is unbeatable, just steps from tons of great restaurants and within very easy walking distance to all places of interest in Ortigia. Our triple room was spotlessly clean, the beds were comfy and above all we enjoyed the most memorable breakfast, taking advantage of the warm and sunny weather at the end of December, we were able to sit outside on the top floor terrace, enjoying the wonderful sea view and the great food which was provided in a kind, friendly and fun way.","34962":"We stayed there in august for a first visit in Syracuse.\nIdeal location,good value for money, excellent Breakfast but especially very welcoming people in th\u00e9 perfect sicilian way.\n\nI recommend it, no doubt.","34964":"In an old palace but with brand new rooms with very modern bathroom . A little cooking space inside the Room.Astonishing how clean were the two rooms we booked.\nIt is in the middle of the Ortigia just 2 minutes from Aretusa spring. Parking is 3 minutes away in another building, another owner but you pay directly in the Hotel. Price is 15 euro up to 12.00 PM when you live the Room. Five euro more if you leave the car After noon. Breakfast is on the roof, closed or open roof, good sweat or salty food and view.Some stuff are typical and Home Made.\nBasicly it is not a Five stars hotels but you feel there very confortable.","34970":"We stayed in a ground floor room, which was spacious, clean, well decorated and equipped for basic cooking. The owners and staff are really helpful and friendly, and organised our taxis to and from bus and rail stations. Breakfast on the terrace is a delight, with fresh orange juice, good coffee, and local specialties to eat. Unfortunately, building works to the adjacent building meant that our window was covered by scaffolding (not the fault of the hotel), so we made a lot of use of the upstairs terrace to sit and take a drink up. We would certainly go back if we return to Siracusa","34971":"This is a small family run hotel in the heart of historic Ortigia. We stayed for 3 nights and hated leaving. The friendliness of the family and their staff was unsurpassed. We were welcomed with a cool drink, and a very genuine greeting. Stephane gave us great recommendations for local restaurants, supplied us with discount cards and entertained us with his lively sense of humour. We felt so at home. Our room on the ground floor was quiet and very comfortable with every amenity you could wish for. Despite being a very old house the decor was modern and very tasteful.The kitchen area was equipped with everything necessary to cook a meal. Breakfast was served on the beautiful rooftop terrace with a magnificent selection of foods reflecting all the tastes of Sicily. Freshly squeezed orange juice and coffee of your choice was prepared by the staff as we relaxed in the morning sun.\nWe could not rate this hotel and it's staff highly enough. I so want to go back someday.!","34974":"The place is hidden in one of the narrow streets of old Ortigia. The conservation of the interior is very good, the rooms are clean and spacious with a small kitchen. Breakfast in the terrace is delicious, with few but good options of eggs, cheese, croissants and homemade jams.","34979":"The island of Ortigia is definitely the place to be in Siracuse. And zooming in you will find in the meltpot of restaurants, bars, B&B's and shops this very nice B&B Aretusa Vacanze, like a remarkable grain of sand on a beach. Because it is located in a small alley in a pedestrianzone you can't reach it by car, only up to 100 meters. But one call and Stefano and a member of his staff hurried to assist us with the suitcases and parking the car (in a private underground parking, remember the adress, you have to go there yourself after check out).\n\nOur room on the groundfloor was a big and nice surprise! Spacious, well maintained and a good bathroom. The breakfast is served on the rooftop. Tasty, fresh regional products and more than enough.\n\nOverall, we liked our two day stay in this B&B and absolutely recommend it if you happen to be in Siracuse for a couple of days.","34980":"Aretusa Vacance was a fabulous place to stay, in a small side street, with everything nearby. We walked everywhere and if you want to check out the mainland the hop on hop off bus stop is nearby. The owners and staff were terrific, advice for restaurants from Stefano and Flavia was exceptional and the breakfast was great, so much choice. Great coffee. There were three couples in our group and we had accomodation on three different floors. Each had a small kitchenette with hot plate, fridge and sink, a couple of barstools and small prep area.","34984":"Small but beautifully clean and tidy room in this converted 17 century house in the heart of Ortigia. Novel, intimate, quaint, bijou - call it what you will, it\u2019s like something from a movie set, with twists and turns through narrow doorways and eccentric stairs. And then there\u2019s the staff. Without exception smiling and helpful without being intrusive. Can\u2019t speak Italian? No problem! With a smile and a gesture they will understand and assist you. The roof terrace for breakfast epitomises the whole place. It\u2019s small, but protected from the elements and offers superb views across the rooftops to the Grand Harbour. What a setting to start the day. Lots of food variety to suit all palates - you\u2019d have to be a real grump not to enjoy it. :wink:","34987":"We spent five nights here as our final stop in Sicily, and our stay proved to be one of the highlights of our trip.\nSicily itself was great - but we were really impressed with the sights and people of Siracusa.\nAretusa Vacanze is a family owned and operated business, and Maurizio, Cinzia, and Stefano and their staff could not have been more welcoming, professional, and helpful with every aspect of our stay including their own services, and also advice on parking, sights, and restaurants.\nThe property is well located in the heart of Ortigia, well-designed with many details and amenities, and perfectly maintained.\nBreakfast on the roof terrace is extremely well done with a wide variety of foods - some home made - and attentive service.\nAll in all, we unreservedly recommend Aretusa Vacanze.","34988":"Perfect little hotel-B&B. Great location, superb staff, lovely rooftop breakfast, AND Best Parking Option on the island. Driving a strange rental car in narrow crowded streets can be daunting. The staff (Stefano) made it easy and safe. Highly recommended. This was a fun 2 day visit with friends, and we regretted having to leave this morning.","34989":"I wish I would have researched parking before booking through the hotel as for 15 euro a night, it's not that cheap, and the garage where you actually park your car is at least a five minute walk from the hotel, and you have to leave your keys with the car as the attendant will move the vehicle to accommodate other arrivals. Our car was fine (no dents, etc.), but I was a little uncomfortable to leave my keys, and if I had known the parking was not on-site, I would have looked at other options. We also booked a two-bedroom apartment, and while the apartment was lovely, it was really just a one bedroom on the second floor with a second double bed in the loft area directly outside the first bedroom (and completely open). Since both bathrooms are outside the first bedroom, it means that if you are in that bedroom and need the bathroom in the night, you'll have to walk past the second bed (and whomever is sleeping in it). This could be fine if you are booking with small children, but I had expected two bedrooms to mean two rooms with their own doors. The location is great--a few blocks from the water and about a five-minute walk to the duomo. We didn't realise that when visiting Siracusa, Ortigia is the place to be, but it is (so if you are reading this, make sure your Siracusa accommodation is in Ortigia, which is the touristy island area with all the gorgeous architecture). Breakfast was served on the terrace and was tasty, and the owners and staff were friendly.","35002":"This is your fantasy. Perfect location. Interesting rooms. Helpful and friendly staff. Breakfast on the roof overlooking Ortiaga\nComfortable beds. Easy and quiet air conditioning. Bring blindfold and ear plugs as open windows bring in passers-by conversations from narrow outside passageways\nStairways inside some of the rooms have embedded night lights for safety.\nYou will be happy here","35004":"We were here 4 years ago and were not disappointed with the 3 night stay we just had...\n\nPros:\n-Everyone is very friendly and customer focused\n-Great location\n-Parking available at 12\u20ac\/night nearby but be careful you need exact change\n-Fantastic breakfast with homemade jams, fresh orange juice.\n-Nice rooms with good showers\n\nCons:\n- If you sleep early\/before 11pm, don\u2019t get a room on the 1st floor facing the street as their is a restaurant next door that can be quite noisy.\n\nSpecial thanks to Stefano who helped with the luggage and Antonio who is always very friendly\n\nWe hope to come back again soon.","35006":"From our first contact to enquire about reserving a parking space, until the moment we left the staff were really helpful and did everything they could to ensure we enjoyed our stay. The room was clean, spacious and comfortable - everything we could ask for. The choice at breakfast exceeded that of larger hotels we stayed in on this visit, and was all delicious.\nIt's right on the edge of the pedestrian area, so perfect for the evening passegiata. I would not hesitate to stay here again if we return to Syracuse.","35007":"We stayed here for 8 nights and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The breakfasts were superb, with plenty of choice, nothing was too much trouble.\nMy only comment regarding access to the rooftop dining area was that you had to negotiate a tiny spiral staircase, which could prove to be challenging for someone with disabilities, but we didn't mind.\nWe had a room on the ground floor, which meant we didn't have to use the stairs. The lift worked well when you kept the destination button depressed for the journey.\nWe were made to feel very welcome at every opportunity. Great place to stay and use as a base to explore Ortigia and Siracusa.","35013":"This B&B is located on the southern end of the island of Ortegia. They had sent directions to the B&B but I had not looked at them so we wandered our way there. The wonderful thing about Ortegia is that wandering and getting lost just leads to interesting sights. However, we were dragging our suitcases. When we arrived, I was a bit apprehensive. We walked down a hallway and we were informed that our room was behind this little, somewhat rickety looking door. It was being cleaned, so we had to wait a few minutes. They had water available and were very pleasant to chat with and they offered us a restroom. I was wondering what I had gotten us into. When the cleaner was done, we went into our room that was truly a small apartment. OH MY! It was beautiful! It had lovey gray tile, a small kitchenette with a table and two stools,a sink, refrigerator and stove, a small couch that I am sure was a futon that could be pulled out for an extra person, a window\/door that looked out on the street in front of the B&B, and then this wonderful, modern bathroom! The fixtures were high end and beautiful. There was a shower, toilet, bidet, and sink that was on a stone vanity. The lighting and mirrors were good. The toiletries were very nice. It was so nice, but the most fun was the loft for the bed. There was a stairway with a bench at the top for suitcases and then a large bed. But, the jewel was a tiny half bath up in the loft for nighttime needs! This apartment had been updated last year. It was fabulous. Every time we went through the small door into our apartment, I felt like Alice walking into Wonderland. The apartment was kept very clean. There were windows open and they had switches to automatically shut or open them. The A\/C worked. We slept very well here. But, this was not the only wonderful parts to this B&B. We had said we would rent a car on Thursday. That meant we would need parking for one night. After arriving in Siracusa, there was no way my husband wanted to drive either in Siracusa or in Ortegia. (People say Palermo is bad. We thought that was just normal city driving. This was crazy!) Anyway, we decided we would try to get the car rented for Friday morning and just leave for the rest of our journey. We were given so much help talking to the Hertz rental place and telling us what we needed to do. We also had somehow rented at a location towards the edge of town. Lucky for us in our opinion, but it did make for a bit of difficulty getting there. They were so nice to arrange a taxi and set the price for us. And, we were not charged for the parking we did not use. We were given many wonderful recommendations for dinner on the island as well. We actually found the place next door to be a good place one night. Now, on to the breakfast! It is served on the roof. You can take an elevator most of the way up, but we always walked. The breakfast was wonderful, delicious, and varied. There were many pastries, (One I was told was homemade by the mother-in-law. YUMMY!) arancini! (Oh they are good!) eggs, bacon, yogurt, fruits, freshly squeezed orange juice, cereal, brushetta, mozzarella,tomatoes, cucumber, meat and cheese plate, small, adorable cups of two different ricotta parfait-like items. There was so much here and beautifully presented! The coffee was some of the best we had. I can't say enough good about Aretusa Vacanze! This was probably our favorite B&B during our whole trip. The lovely room, wonderful customer service and friendliness coupled with the fantastic breakfast made this truly a special place. I highly recommend it. Grazie mille, Aretusa Vacanze!","35016":"This place is in the middle of old Ortegia. An old complicated building has been converted into a tasteful and pleasant B&B. The hosts go out their way to get you to the hotel, which will include about 80 m of walking, and bringing you in your car to an underground parking lot, where you leave your keys. The rooms we lived in were large, and very pleasant. Breakfast was on top of roof - very small but very friendly served and tasty. You are right in middle of things. Make sure to tell the parking manager when you need the car, so he can maneuver the car into an easily accessible place at the appropriate time.","35019":"Family run and very friendly. Room was fine. Great rooftop terrace and breakfast - very good food with lots of local specialities. We are from the US and had a car. The communication before we arrived and once there was very good. There is private parking for a few but the B&B helps you with very clear directions - meet you at an easy place and then go with you to parking. The son is very helpful and has many good suggestions . It\u2019s in a very good location in the old town (ortiega). Great place to stay for locale, wonderful breakfast, friendly family and their knowledge.","35020":"We had a wonderful time in this place. We stayed two nights and our hosts were very kind and dealt with matters personally and showing honest concern. We had to leave very early and they prepared a breakfast tray for us and all.\n\nOrtigia is a most lovely neighbourhood. Romantic, picturesque, simply magical. So was our room. With designs on the ceiling, space, and very comfy.\n\nAnd it was lovely to have breakfast (the first morning) on the terrace; the staff prepare everything for you, coffee and spremuto d'arancia.\n\nFive-star stay.","35021":"Aretusa Vacanze is a top-notch B&B, very modern and lovely, with super helpful and professional staff (who speak English fluently). They have an arrangement with the authorities so that guests may bring their cars into the limited access zone, and can park easily in a nearby garage \u2014 unusual for Ortigia. Their suggestions for place to get an aperitivo and have dinner were excellent. And the roof-top breakfast was outstanding, the best we had during our three weeks in Sicily and Sardinia.","35024":"We loved this hotel. Welcoming and attentive staff, amazingly comfortable beds, spacious accommodations. Rooftop breakfast on terrace (8-10am) was perfect. Many homemade options--all delicious. Our 3 kids loved the breakfast offerings as well.\nHotel includes free wifi.\nParked nearby (with hotel's assistance), at an underground parking facility. Great location. Took #2 city bus from near marketplace to see Greek sights.\nWould definitely return to this gem.","35025":"We stayed 3 nights at this wonderful B&B in Ortigia. Lovely large room with a small kitchenette, great breakfasts served on the roof terrace with lots of choice and parking nearby. Ortigia is fantastic beautiful architecture and a beautiful place to just wander around and soak up the Sicilian way of life. We will definitely be back","35026":"This is a pleasant b&b with little kitcheonettes off a small side street in Ortygia. The island is small and walkable, so you can't really go wrong in terms of location if you're on the island itself. We accidentally booked a quadruple room, which meant we had two separate bedrooms, each with its own queen-sized bed and air conditioner. This was nice but more space than we needed for just two people. It would be a good size for a small family though.\n\nThe kitcheonette was small but basic: a mostly empty fridge, a sink, a couple of burners, and some plates\/cutlery. You wouldn't be able to cook very extensively here but it was fine for small things.\n\nThere was a small balcony and a rack for drying laundry, which was very, very helpful for hand-washing a few pieces of clothing. The balcony overlooked a restaurant and the smells were fun when the door was open, but we couldn't hear anything when it was closed. We were right next to the staircase leading to the roof terrace where breakfast was served, which meant there was some noise starting around 7:30 am when breakfast started, but it wasn't a huge problem. The bed was very soft (we didn't love that but it's a personal preference) and the air conditioning was powerful and easy to control.\n\nBreakfast itself was very generous - lots of different cheeses, meats, and pastries, and some hot food with meat. We are vegetarian so we couldn't eat any of the hot food, but it looked good. There were also a dozen homemade jams and fresh-squeezed orange juice. The terrace was open all the time and we went up with a bottle of wine one evening and looked at the stars, which were incredible - there is very little light pollution.\n\nParking is at a garage about a 7-minute walk away. The hotel gave us detailed instructions for how to park, and the car was valet-parked once we got to the garage. If you're concerned about driving on Ortygia, the hotel actually made it very easy and we only had to drive on one of the bigger streets on the edge of the island, not the narrow and twisty streets in the middle. Parking was 12 euros a day which seemed fair given the extreme difficulty of parking on the island, and the hotel was up-front about it. You do have to walk with your luggage from the garage to the hotel.","35030":"We have thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Aretusa Vacanze for the following reasons:\n\n- Ideal location in the heart of Ortigia;\n- Very helpful and friendly owners and staff;\n- Great value in having 2 bedrooms with a kitchenette for a wonderfully reasonable price;\n- Lovely breakfast on roof terrace with great coffee;\n- Great, high quality and quiet A\/C;\n- Good sleeping conditions ;\n- comfortable beds;\n- Immaculate;\n- Good wifi;\n- Folk art paintings in rooms with beautifully stenciled walls and ceilings;\n- Generous amenities in bathrooom;\n\nAlthough the TV had one English language channel ,BBC ,!we would have liked to have additional English language stations. CNN would have been especially nice.\n\nWe would certainly welcome a return stay to this property in the future","35031":"Aretusa Vacanze is a wonderful B&B with an outstanding breakfast and excellent service. One of its best features, though, is its location. It is centrally located in the heart of Ortigia and within easy walking distance to all of the historical sites. Although it is located in a limited parking zone, access is granted for hotel guests and parking is located nearby. Our room was spacious with a small, but, modern bathroom and a small kitchen area. Breakfast is outstanding: served on the top floor of the B&B with excellent views of the neighboring roof tops And, the food was some of the best that we had in Italy: excellent cappuccino, home made pastries, orange juice squeezed to order, and lots of fresh fruits and cheeses. We will make a point of returning to Ortigia so that we can stay here again.","35044":"We absolutely loved our stay at the CinqueSuites! We booked 2 rooms for our stay- one on the ground floor with the spa.\n\nWe found the suites were really well located- a short walk to all parts of ortigia. There isn\u2019t a whole lot in terms of beaches in ortigia but there is a solarium very close to cinque suites where you can pay for two sun beds for the day and there is a ladder going down to the water if you want to go for a swim. For those that don\u2019t want to pay there is also an area nearby where you can swim off the rocks.\n\nThe staff at the suites were incredibly warm and welcoming and nothing was too much trouble! They gave us a complimentary bottle of wine and a small gift when we departed as well!\n\nThey have put a lot of effort into decorating the rooms - they are stylish, comfortable and modern. I particularly loved the oversized pillows and found the beds very comfortable.\n\nWe were there in August and used the spa a few times and found the temperature of the water to be fine! It wasn\u2019t too hot (but definitely was not freezing as I read another review state) which was good as we were there in the heat of summer.\n\nWe got a transfer here as we were not driving around and found it a a little tricky to find as the entry is down a little laneway off the road. We also left on a Sunday via private car transfer but found there is a no driving restriction in the area on that day at certain times so we had to go meet our driver at the Apollo temple (an 8 minute walk away). This didn\u2019t detract from our stay and is obviously not the fault of the hotel but just something to be mindful of when organising logistics.\n\nOverall I would definitely return and would recommend staying here to others!","35048":"We were very lucky to have found this beautiful boutique hotel right in the middle of Ortigia - the perfect base to explore this stunning city from. In fact this was our favourite experience of our trip to Sicily. Liliana and Christian have clearly spent a lot of time focusing on the small details that make such a difference to an hotel experience - from the design elements in each room, to the breakfast buffet focusing on a local experience but also offering healthier options which I find are often lacking in other hotels, to the attentive and quick responses via email in the run up to our arrival when we had many questions and requests!\n\nYes, it is in the centre of the wonderful maze-like streets of Ortigia but that is part of the charm and after a quick call to Liliana (who speaks very good English) she was able to direct our taxi driver to the hotel with ease. Greeted on arrival by Liliana she made sure we had everything we needed and followed up on a few excursions and tours we had booked via her. The rest of the team were just as attentive and very welcoming.\n\nWe would love to return to Ortigia and if we did there would be no question of where to stay as we would certainly return to CinqueSuites. Cannot recommend this hotel more highly.","35052":"We have just returned from a 1 week stay at this wonderful B&B and would not have minded to stay longer. It was opened only last year, the suites are contemporary, clean and have everything you need. The bed is comfortable and there is a rainforest shower in the bathroom. There is no parking next to the hotel available due to the location right in the old city center but they can arrange for guarded parking a couple of streets away. But apart from this general lack of parking space the city center location is ideal with lots of things to see and many restaurants and bars within a short walking distance. And of course the seaside is always just around the corner! Breakfast is served on the roof top terrace when the weather is good which I think it is most of the time. The products they serve are fresh, local and many of them home made, very nice! Try the almond granita if it is available (yes, for breakfast!), it is delicious! Staff and owners are really kind and always ready to help, it felt like a home away from home and we can recommend it 100%!","35058":"Right from the arranged pick up from Catania Airport this boutique hotel delivered on all expectations and more.From first impressions it is obvious that the property has recently undergone major renovation , very tastefully done with a clean, modern decor which would suit even the most conservative of tastes. Our room (suite 2) was spacious and equipped with modern and stylish fixtures and fittings to make our stay most enjoyable. Thanks to the winter sun we were able to take breakfast on the roof terrace, choosing from a comprehensive breakfast menu which suited our requirements perfectly. There is no shortage of bars, cafes or restaurants all within easy reach of the property suiting all tastes and prices. Ortigia island is very easy to navigate and offers a great insight to Siciliano life and culture. Again easily accessible by foot is Syracusa just over the bridges which is definitely worth the walk.From here both road and rail links open up the region and beyond for those who wish to travel independently and not drive. To summarise, our short stay on Ortigia was made all the more enjoyable by choosing to stay at CinqueSuites and many thanks to the proprietors Christian and Liliana who made it so especially with their care and kindness. I wish them both well in their business venture.","35061":"The hotel looks nice on the photos but... There is mold on the walls, the spa is very cold in the Suite 1 (unusable), it\u2019s noisy in the rooms because of the stairwell just behind the door, the staff does not help you, there is no place to park, you have the breakfast in your room if the weather is not good.","35063":"Arrived after a long flight and they arranged for a pick up (extra charge) so it was nice and easy ride to the hotel. Small property, may be difficult to find if you are not familiar, in the centre of the city with just five suites. The couple who own it, Christian and Liliana, don't speak English but Liliana understands and they have one person who is around at times who does. Christian had a nice plate of baked goodies for me with a coffee on arrival and had a wonderful breakfast the next day on the terrace. The suite comprised of a living area and a bedroom that were compact but comfortable with modern decor and good bathroom. Unfortunately the shower had a drainage problem but nothing that couldn't have been fixed easily. I would recommend this property for its location and contemporary styling.","35070":"Hotel locates in an old building at the tip of Ortiga island near Castello Maniace. It is a bit tricky to arrive by car and there is no parking nearby. Valet parking is available.\nWe had very nice suite with sea view. There were also two bathrooms, both having showers (good!). Tv was in the bedroom, not in living room, where I would have put it. Very good service. Nice breakfast.","35075":"We stayed for one night at Syracuse, Sicily at the Charme Henry House - and we wished we stayed an extra night. Henry House was a fantastic place to lay our head. The staff were super awesome and accommodating, providing helpful info during our stay. Because we visited off-season, they kindly upgraded us without us asking to a room with a seaside view which was spectacular. You definitely want to grab a room with a view. Everything was perfect - the bed, the shower, the location, the breakfast. The breakfast included so many options and it was hard to not try everything. I would stay here again absolutely.","35076":"An atmospheric small boutique hotel with a great location. The hotel and the rooms have their own unique style, which I liked. Staff nice and helpful from the beginning of the visit to the very end. Junior Suite with terrace was a shot in 10. The intimate terrace turned out to be the perfect place to watch the sunset with a glass of wine. In the morning, you can enjoy a rich breakfast that can be enjoyed on the outdoor terrace overlooking the sea.\nThe hotel offers the opportunity to take care of a car for an extra 25 euros.\nA really interesting hotel that I would recommend.","35077":"Recommended by a friend, this is a charming characterful and quirky hotel in an amazing central location in Syracuse, with a fantastic little raised courtyard\/terrace which overlooks the waterfront (great for people watching at breakfast or cocktail hour!). Staff were wonderful, giving recommendations, lending umbrellas, chatting to the toddler etc. The only downside is that the rooms are a little bit on the small size (when you had to factor in a cot as we did) and because it's old the noise insulation isn't great so we could hear next door's bathroom. Note you can park to drop off bags but then you'll need to transfer to the public carpark.","35078":"This is an excellent little hotel with a terrific staff near the fort in Ortigia. The breakfasts are superb. Despite the age of the building the rooms are well appointed and very comfortable. The building backs up to the shore road and most rooms have a sea view. Our room was the only one facing the street making it occasionally a little noisy with the window open. There are multiple balconies and areas with tables so that you can enjoy your breakfast overlooking the water.\n\nThe staff are friendly and very helpful with good restaurant recommendations and directions to attractions. We heartily recommend this hotel.","35080":"Pros\n- Great location you can walk anywhere from the hotel\n- Amazing staff and service, upon arrival you have a welcome drinks, they provide you with great advice on restaurants and nearby things to see.\n- Quirky but fun hotel + decoration\n- Great view from the terrasse where you can enjoy a drink and breakfast\n- Good breakfast with a lot of options\n\nCons:\n- Difficult to access the hotel by car. Streets are narrow and, even with the GPS, its not that straight forward.\n- Lack of parking near the hotel, hence you have to pay \u00a325 for a valet parking service which the hotel takes care of.\n- Noisy room as the hotel is quite 'old' we basically heard every footstep of our neighbours upstairs but we had a good sleep (good bed)","35081":"I am not sure if I got the story right but it took the owner and a friend 10 years to prepare and decorate this house in order to make it what it is today: a jewel with very comfortable rooms. The service is excellent and charming in whichever situation you might be: at the reception, drinking your welcome drink on the terrace with a marvelous view on to the sea, at breakfast served on the same terrace. The hotel is located in Ortigia, the oldest part of town and you can explore the small streets or walk alongside the sea.","35082":"My wife and I visited Sicily in mid September 2019.\nWe stayed at the Hotel Liberty in Catania, Hotel Toadumus in Taormina and Charme Henry's House in Ortigia \/ Syracuse.\n\nThey were three of the best hotels in which I've stayed and totally fit for purpose for each location and I couldn't recommend them enough. Well priced, excellent locations and the highest quality of service. We were blessed in Sicily and these three hotels fully enhanced our total experience.\n\nCharme Henry's House was a true delight. Beautifully furnished rooms, ours had a seaview, excellent hosting from Francesco, Neomi and Sabrina at the desk, full of excellent restaurant tips and booking them. Quality of their care was second to none. I had a toothache and Sabrina and Francesco organised a local dentist to visit me at the hotel, who sorted me with pain relief.\n\nThe bar staff and breakfast team were charming and the bar\/ breakfast area overlooking the sea under tree cover was a delight.\n\nThis is a boutique hotel which never seemed crowded. It was a real joy to have been a guest here. Fantastic!!!","35085":"We stayed here for 2 nights last month during our visit to Ortigia. The hotel is wonderful.. We had a livingroom area with a sofa then a bedroom. Our room had 2 bathrooms. It was a superior double bedroom with sea view. It was a fabulous room. Clean and the air conditioning worked A++++. We were able to adjust the ac so our room was freezing. Just the way my husband likes it.\nThe Hotel staff were very friendly and helpful with directions and recommendations for restaurants and sights.\nThe breakfast was fantastic. The pastries,pies and quiches were all very tasty. I believe they are all cooked on the premises. Every morning we were able to eat our breakfast on the terrace overlooking the sea. Our travel agent that booked the hotel was concerned that my husband may not like it as he is used to a typical 4\/5 star hotel. She explained this hotel was more along the style of a B&B. Well, we both enjoyed our stay here very much. It is a charming place and well situated. Although at the end of the island it was a short walk to the cathedral and maybe 15 minute walk to the market.","35087":"We visited Henry's House soon after they opened 5 or 6 years back. It was wonderful then so we returned for a 5 day stay last month. Henry's House remains a charming small retreat house in a superb neighborhood of Ortigia. Francesco and his colleagues are welcoming, helpful and kind hosts. The breakfast is great in its European buffet style and changes each morning. They also have bikes to use free of charge to see teh island. Great recommendations for both casual and fancy dinners as well. We have relatives in teh area so we shall return. Great visit so thanks to teh team there!!","35089":"My husband and I stayed at this charming hotel for a week. Superb customer service - very knowledgeable and helpful with restaurant recommendations. We had our breakfast on a gorgeous terrace overlooking the sea and where we had an early evening pre dinner drink watching the sun go down. Excellent and wide ranging breakfast provided. A very relaxing stay","35091":"We were delighted with all aspects of our 3 night stay at Henry's House. We booked a junior suite which was basically one room but it had a sofa and a wonderful view and a great bathroom. There were lovely amenities like a welcome drink on arrival, bottle of wine in the room, complementary mini-bar and lots of indoor and outdoor places for comfortably hanging out. Breakfast was excellent. The hotel is at the southern end of Ortigia. Easily walkable to everything, but there is also a bus that stops near the hotel that you can take to the archeological museum and ruins and anywhere else you want to go in Syracuse. Very friendly and helpful staff also!","35092":"Friendly staff, excellent location\/terraces. Very good access to the sights. The decor is a little eccentric and not a particularly good restoration. Lots of strange amateur modern art. Free mini bar but at this price it should be. There was a serious problem with flies infesting the breakfast terrace which was a real shame as it drove me inside on both days. Parking is a nightmare!","35093":"Wasted an hour trying to get backs out of the car. When you stop in front of the hotel, you stop all the traffic. It wasn't until I had driven around for 30 minutes that I found out the hotel had valet parking at 25E a day. Would have been easier if we had known before. Staff were very friendly and efficient. Breakfast was very good. They had a lovely patio to view the sunsets. The room was so small we could not open 2 suitcases at the same time. Would not stay again.","35094":"The hotel is like stepping into someone's luxurious home, very private and tastefully decorated. From excellent L'occitane toiletries to complimentary drinks on arrival, you feel truly looked after. Loved the various terraces where you could sit and soak up the atmosphere. The breakfast was nice and plentiful and the staff - amazing, so helpful and friendly. Great recommendations about lunch\/dinner and if you need to park your car, the easiest thing to do is to ask them to organize a service where someone comes to get your car and brings it back when you need, around 25euro for this service. We loved our stay, a little noisy as our room was looking at the street, but besides that absolutely perfect.","35095":"The hotel is situated in a key area right at the heart of Ortigia and is easily accessed by foot or car. The rooms seem all fairly spacious and the interior is warm and in line with the style of the hotel. The breakfast has a fresh variety of pastries, juices and local delicacies. The rooms at the back are better and quieter. The down side of my room was that can be very noisy with cars and people passing by during the night waking you up. The whole staff is extremely helpful if your reach them for any help.","35103":"My partner and I stayed here two nights and i wish it could have been longer. The rooms are beautiful the bathroom was amazing, and seeing L\u2019OCCITANE shower gel, shampoo and soaps was a wonderful surprise. Everything was perfect. Breakfast was absolutely the best we had in Sicily, everything was fresh and homemade. And I want to say a special thank you to all the staff, you made us feel so welcome, the time you took to explain where everything is and what we need to see was awesome. So thank you. We chose to put our hire car in the secure parking and it's the best option as is hassle free, safe and stress free.\n\nMy partner and I loved out room, we loved everything about the hotel, and the views from the terrace are stunning...\n\nWe will be returning next year in the summer and can't wait to stay longer...\n\nThank you to all the staff for an amazing and welcoming stay.\n\nHayden & Patricia","35104":"The hotel is in the historic centre ,a renovated historic building with quite a variety of rooms.There are terraces overlooking the bay and breakfast can be taken outside in decent weather.The staff are the big attraction, nothing is too much trouble for front of house .They know and book all the local restaurants and can advise on every subject under the sun. Breakfast is a delightful buffet and all freshly prepared. A welcome drink is a nice touch ,and in the mini suite you get a free small minibar.\nThere are plenty of good trattoria and restaurants within a short walk\nTOP TIP; Parking is a nightmare in Ortigia so sort it out with the hotel before you arrive. Options include 15 mins away unreserved or a meet and greet that collects your car on arrival and delivers it to the hotel when you need it during your stay. The former is 10 euros a day , the latter 20 euros. They will also advise on the traffic zone and register your no plate to avoid penalty charges.","35105":"Henry's house is one of the best hotels I have stayed in. Our room had a view of the sea and was quiet. The hotel was formed by renovating and combining two old palazzi. You can easily walk to anywhere in Ortigia, including the lungomare which has many bars and restaurants. All the staff were very helpful. Special thanks to Sabrina for helping us buy train tickets on line. We hope we can return and stay here again.","35106":"Stayed two nights. Interesting art work and furnishings. Very helpful staff with nice breakfast. Great neighborhood. Nice view of the sea from the rooftop terrace. Wine and snacks in the afternoon. Recommended!","35107":"As the title says, it is quaint and quirky with all manner of antique furniture and decorations. The price was bit higher than we usually pay, but the staff certainly go out of their way to be very helpful. They gave a welcome bottle of red wine and when we asked for white they said no problem and that they would put a bottle in the fridge for us. They then served us the wine on the nice patio overlooking the sea. The breakfast was excellent and can be taken inside or on the patio. They even offer to carry the tray outside for you.\nOne thing to mention, which is not their fault, is that there is recycling pickup at about 6:30am on Wednesday or Thursday. We were awakened by an almighty crash as the containers of bottles were emptied.\nIf arriving by train you can walk there in about 20 minutes (cross the bridge and then turn right to the waterfront and just go all the way to the end, passing through a small park and past the Fountain of Arethusa. At the end turn left and left again on Castello Maniace. A much prettier and smother way than the city streets.)","35108":"Stayed 4 nights in the junior suite with sea view and terrace. What a friendly place to stay in Ortigia, the views in early morning and the long sunsets were memorable. Such a well cared for house with all of Carmello's life. The Restuarant terrace and the breakfasts were delightful. We both felt the heart of Sicily was here.","35109":"Regardless the other good reviews, I cannot recommend an establishment, which does not bring a bill nor a receipt (hence avoiding taxes). I followed the situation during the app. hour, which we sat there, and, alas, nobody else got it either.\n\nThis is also exceptional in Italy nowadays.","35110":"This hotel is really central yet quiet as it is just off where all the main touristy areas are. The road is however not for the faint hearted, we organised valet parking before but still had to stop to get ourselves and our cases out which caused a hooting par excellence. the delightful receptionist Naomi who came out to help us move a heavy potted tree to make room for the car, told us that even though she is Sicilian she hates Sicilian drivers. The hotel is absolutely charming, chock a block full of antiques and uneven floors. Our room was furnished with antiques with contemporary paintings on the wall and the doors led out to a huge stone terrace overlooking the water. The bathroom was not that large but stocked with Verbena from L'Occitaine, always a plus point. In the evening we sat on the gorgeous terrace under grape vines and enjoyed our prosecco. We ate at aLevante restaurant which the delightful receptionist booked for us and had a wonderful meal away from the madding crowd.The following morning when we checked out, we were only here for one night, not nearly enough, we were told the drinks were on the house. Breakfast was amazing, a journey through everything Sicilian from cold meats to cheeses,fruits and pastries fresh bread, everything. One could eat on the terrace or stay in the small breakfast room. The praise that is heaped on this place is fully deserved. We will recommend it further and if we are back in the area make a beeline for Henry's House. It cannot be beaten for atmosphere and for the wonderful staff...a highlight:)","35111":"The streets got narrower and narrower as we approached the hotel, we managed to get the only temporary parking spot available. It is important that you make arrangements with the hotel for the valet parking otherwise parking is non existent.\n\nThe hotel has beautiful terraces to sit on and enjoy drinks and breakfast. The views are spectacular.\n\nOur room was large, clean and comfortable. The bathroom was also a generous size and very clean. The staff were very friendly and allowed us to store our bags the next day after we checked out so that we could walk around Ortigia.\n\nThe staff made dinner reservations for us at a fantastic restaurant nearby. We loved our breakfast the next morning sitting among the grape vines on the terrace enjoying the views.\n\nWe would highly recommend this hotel.","35112":"Other review descriptions are spot on. Relatively quiet area near the harbor and a beach. Terrace overlooking the sea is great.\n\nIf you don't want to negotiate stairs, be sure to get a room on the bottom floor or on the upper level the lift opens up to.","35113":"Finding the hotel was one thing; parking the car another. But the hotel staff came to the rescue: moving the flower pots out front to free up a temporary parking spot so we could unload and check in. The parking situation is impossible on Ortigia, but for 20 Euros they provided a valet service of taking the car off to a garage and bringing it back the next day when needed. The hotel staff was extremely helpful and gracious. The decor of the hotel including our room was funky\/quirky. Interesting paintings and color schemes. Our room was of adequate size,overlooked the sea\/harbor, so we had a nice water view with the sound of voices coming from the pedestrian walk along the sea below our open window. The bathroom was so-so. There was a terrace common seating area with nice shade and views of the sea. This is where we were given a complimentary drink upon check in. And it was also an option to have breakfast served. The breakfast buffet was very nice-extensive selection of meats, cheeses, pastries, juices, fruits, choices of hot drinks, etc. The breakfast room was of limited size but there was always the outside terrace option. The hotel is located on the Ortigia island of Syracuse. From the hotel, one can easily walk to any of the sites on Ortigia. Upon check out, we drove to the ancient Greek and Roman ruins less than 30 minutes away.","35114":"I would really recommend this hotel. Parking isn't easy in the old part of Syracuse, but Henry's House offers an excellent parking service, which takes away the hassle. The hotel is located right in the heart of Ortigia, the island centre of Syracuse. That makes it very central to everything you want to visit during the day and for a large array of dining places in the evening. Breakfast on the terrace was a joy and the hotel staff couldn't have been more helpful or pleasant.","35115":"Henry's terrace is one of my favourite places in the world. Place is decorated personally, but with good taste. Family run which is a big plus. Breakfast is best I have had in Italy and you can eat it on the terrace. I shall return!","35116":"Great breakfasts, good staff and location. The rooms are quite small and not luxurious but we had the most fantastic view of the sea from our window. No complaints at all and would happily stay again. We loved Sicily so much we are going back next year.","35118":"We stayed 2 nights in a double room with street view. The hotel is just great, matching all photos provided on booking sites and on their site. Very unusual, artsy place, just a fantastic stay experience. The staff was really nice and helpful, the breakfast was the best and you can eat it on a terrace overlooking the sea - what a pleasure. It was almost perfect, yet some improvements may make the stay more comfortable. Our rooms were on a first floor street side and very early in the morning we were waken by trash removal trucks and passing motorcycles. Sound proof windows would be a nice addition. Also a bit more light in the bathroom would be nice - applying my mascara was a bit challenging.","35120":"I am writing this on our final night whilst sitting on our terrace overlooking the sea.\nIf you can, splash out on the junior suite with the private terrace, it is beautiful. Breakfast is brought up every morning and there is no better place to have pre dinner glass of wine. The rooms are quirky with very good (l\u2019occitaine) toiletries. Breakfast is excellent.\nThe location is wonderful and if you want to have a dip in the sea, there are beach clubs and swimming spots near by. I would definitely stay here again.","35121":"This charming 14 room hotel has lots of pluses. Great sea views from some rooms, breakfast on the terrace with magnificent views, very friendly and helpful people - the number one thing for me. Location on the Island is perfect and very close to a late night Osteria for late arrivals. Other travelers mentioned the beds, they could be softer. Good AC.\nWe were really pleased with our selection. Airport connections arranged.\n\nDfc2007","35123":"Never have I stayed in a hotel costing this much a night and been disappointed by the bed!! It's like a military camp bed. What!! When you're paying this much you expect a comfortable night's sleep and this is a serious flaw in the hotel. It was smaller than the headboard, sagged in the middle and looked ridiculous. Cutting corners on an important aspect like this means a bad rating, I'm afraid.\n\nThe only reason I haven't rated it worse is because the location is great next to the castle, the staff are really helpful, the old style in most of the hotel is beautiful with antique furniture and mirrors, old flag stones, and tiled floors. The views from the sun breakfast terrace over the sea are calming in the morning and you can enjoy an aperitif at sunset. Fantastic.\n\nYou walk through the beautiful hotel and then you get to the door of your room and it's like a child has been asked to paint the doors and the carpenter was drunk when he tried to fit the bathroom door into the frame.\n\nThe bathroom... bright red tiles, dim lighting and a sticky shower head and tap. Yuck. Luckily I had my Dettol wipes on me. The floors were a bit sticky too. Gross.\n\nThe quirky paintings I loved. Until I looked up from my camp bed and saw some balletic vampires above me. Hahahaha. Seriously.","35124":"We stayed in Henry's House for 4 nights. Not only was it very convenient for exploring Ortigia but it also provided a very warm welcome from the staff, excellent breakfasts ( often taken on the terrace) and a comfortable room (with partial sea view) - a little dark but no bad thing in such a hot climate. The hotel itself is wonderfully individual with an eclectic decor and an interesting change from bland, modern chains.We'd happily stay here again on another visit.\nWe'd like to underline how pleasant and helpful the staff were - many thanks to all of them!","35128":"The hotel was nice: great location, friendly staff, quirky old style decor, efficient air con.\n\nBut it failed on the most important point: sleep quality. The bed was the most uncomfortable I have ever encountered in a hotel ever. And I travel a lot. It was hard, and every move me or my husband made was accompanied by loud squeeky noises. All through the night. I didn\u2019t sleep AT ALL!! It looks stylish, but how on earth can you put such a bed in a hotel is beyond me. Each room is individually decorated, so maybe we were just unlucky (we were in room 205).\n\nApart from that: great location near the duomo and with view of the sea. Very helpful staff. Antique interiors. Large comfortable rooms. A few small terraces with seaview.","35130":"We have stayed at the hotel for 2 nights and it was brilliant . The boutique hotel is very original and done in a really quirky way . The room wasn\u2019t big but lovely , with direct view of the sea . Hotel terraces are fabulous I think they give the best view of the sunrise in the island . Near but there is a cost beach club Zefir. And the stuff super super friendly ! Welcome drink was a nice touch too . Highly recommend this property .","35131":"We have just returned from a truly fantastic 2 weeks spent at CHHH. The first week was in the junior suite with the private terrace which gives incredible views over the bay and to the hills beyond, the second week was in one of the spacious sea view rooms. The rooms were immaculately cleaned every day, with interesting artwork on the walls and lovely antique furniture - beds were really comfortable. Breakfasts on one of the three terraces (or private terrace of the junior suite) was a fantastic start to the day- a huge selection of local cheeses, meats, pastries, yoghurts, fruit, and much much more- all served by the very kind, friendly and efficient Carla and Luana, for whom nothing is too much trouble. The entire team of staff are of the highest quality and so professional but having that warm friendly service that typifies this little hotel; providing any help, advice and guidance. Their knowledge of Ortigia and wider Sicily and its history is astonishing, which ensures that you can really make the most of this amazing island. Special mention must go to the front desk team of Elisa, Massimo, Noemi, Sabrina and Clelia- they are simply the best!","35132":"We\u2019ve spent 2 nights in the suite with 2 kids. Everything in this hotel is perfect and the beauty is everywhere. A stunning view from the terrace where you can enjoy a wonderful breakfast and a very nice room. The hotel is located walking distance from the center of Ortigia","35134":"this hotel was perfect for us. Close to the sea and close...but not too close.. to the centre. We loved the outdoor terrace for breakfast ( delicious food )and watching the comings and goings in the bay. Our room was clean,spacious and air conditioning was a god send. The hotel staff were all welcoming, helpful and informative. We are plannng another stay.","35136":"We recently stayed for 2 wonderful nights at this beautiful hotel, and amazing city, and enjoyed every moment! The front desk staff were so nice and very helpful with offering excellent restaurant recommendations and assistance with any of our questions. We were offered nice welcome drinks (Prosecco) upon our arrival, which we enjoyed on their nice outdoor terrace overlooking the peaceful calm sea. Our room had a nice view of the terrace and sea and horizon, with beautiful glass\/wooden doors that opened to a small balcony overlooking the scenes. They have a very nice complimentary breakfast and the morning staff is very nice and helpful as well. If you're arriving with a rental car, we'd recommend just using their valet service and pay the $20 euro \/ day as parking anywhere around the area is crazy.","35137":"The hotel is certainly quirky. I quite liked the old features especially on the terraces where there were old sinks and tiles, but our room was hideous. The furniture looked like it was picked up from a dump, wardrobe painted yellow and green, the bathroom vanity made of varnished plywood with an 'artistic' hole cut out at the back so our toiletries would fall through to the floor. I like contemporary art but this did not go with the antiques and other features of the hotel - I thought it was awful.\nThe staff were nice, food fine. Noise from people at the bar nearby and walking along the seafront was so loud we had to leave our window and shutters closed.","35138":"We had booked a room with a view of the sea or rooftops and a balcony but were given a room looking out on the busy street which was very noisy. NO balcony. One day the electricity was out for almost the whole day and for most of our five night stay our main light was not working. Staff were pleasant, especially the wait staff at breakfast who brought our breakfast upstairs to the terrazzo so we could enjoy the sea view. Probably would choose somewhere else next time","35139":"The property itself has a great location. Right at the sea front and within 5 Min walk to all attractions. This is not a luxurious place but the perfect spot if you appreciate history and boutique hotels. The attention of staff makes all the difference. Perfect breakfast","35140":"We loved our stay at Charme Hotel Henry's House! We highly recommend staying in Ortygia rather than the larger Syracuse. Charme Hotel Henry's House is in a wonderful location. It is furnished beautifully and has a lovely terrace overlooking the water where we enjoyed wonderful breakfasts and sunset cocktails. Our room was beautiful with stone walls and a window that opened up onto the sea. The staff was so welcoming and offered wonderful suggestions for restaurants and more! We were sorry to leave!","35141":"Fabulous quirky hotel with fabulous staff in a brilliant location. The sea views are to die for,& breakfasts were beautifully presented with a huge variety. The receptionists were very helpful and the lovely young lady serving her signature cocktails was delightful. The rooms were spacious & spotless, with the towels & pillowslips changed daily. A multitude of local restaurants are within easy flat walking distance. The elevator was appreciated. Will definitely return.","35142":"I love this hotel. It local character and charm, and the balconies with sea views are great places to relax. The staff could not be better - very friendly and helpful. Parking is difficult on the island - no problem because they can arrange if for you. We needed help with laundry, they arranged for same day service. We asked where to find a birthday card for our son and they brought a Sicilian cake and candle to his room! Drinks on the patio looking at the sea, not a problem. Breakfast is great too. Would definitely return here for another visit to Ortigia.","35143":"We spent 2 nights here. Our room was comfortable and we were offered a free welcome drink on the terrace and we watched the sun set - stunning. There was also a complimentary bittle if local wine in our room. The bathroom was tiny but offered lots of goodies including slippers! The room was very clean ( except under the bed) and the staff fir breakfast and working the bar were lovely. The breakfast was very good and could also be gad in the terrace. We paid 200 Ruth a night and an extra 20 for secure parking. This in our opinion was a little over priced . We would recommend it but not at that price!","35144":"A wonderful location situated in historic Ortygia, on the waterfront and within walking distance of many of Syracuse's many historical and other attractions. Lovely quirky rooms and a superb breakfast. Staff were very friendly even when we arrived close to midnight.","35145":"This is a real one-off, with extremely helpful and attentive staff and a thousand minor details that are quirky and fun - definitely not your standard 'hotel chain'. Location is towards the southern tip of Ortygia but a very easy and delightful walk away from everything. Don't take a car unless you really need it, though the hotel has thoughtfully arranged a special deal for valet parking. The staff are delightful, and provided us with every possible assistance. Breakfast is wonderfully Sicilian, and can be taken on the outside terrace, where you can also get a good range of drinks","35146":"Henry's House is a super place to stay and has real character.\n\nOur room was a good size, with a very comfortable bed and a well-fitted bathroom. The window faced onto the small street but there was little traffic or other street noise, and just outside the door was a balcony with views over the bay.\n\nBreakfast (which could be taken in the dining room or on a terrace also with sea views) was a splendid choice of cereals, cold meat, cheese, eggs, savoury pastries, cakes, tarts etc., with something new every day.\n\nThe staff (who all spoke good English) were all very friendly and helpful. In particular one of the ladies on reception (whose name I missed) went to a lot of trouble to arrange a guide to take us to the River Ciane nature reserve, which was well worth the trip.\n\nThe hotel is near the tip of Ortygia but you can walk to anywhere on the island in 20 minutes or so - in fact we eschewed public transport and also walked to the archeological sites in 'mainland' Syracuse. We left our car in the Talete car park (\u20ac10 per day, but ask for advice first at hotel reception about how this works!), although the hotel can also arrange off-island parking with delivery to and collection from the hotel for \u20ac20 per day if you prefer the convenience.\n\nOverall, thoroughly recommended.","35148":"Henry's House combines an extremely friendly and accommodating staff with delightful rooms, done with a original and amusing style. The hotel is extremely well situated in Ortegia, with views of the sea, and offers an excellent, extensive breakfast, drinks in the evening on the terrace etc. Our rooms were good-sized, quiet and very pleasant. Overall, wonderful.","35149":"Terrific hotel on the water with lovely views of the sea and city from rooms. Outdoor rooftop sitting area with sea view is perfect for breakfast or a drink. Staff is helpful and friendly. Rooms are large and comfortable. Common areas are beautifully decorated. Breakfast service is plentiful and delicious. Small hotel with big hotel service.","35150":"Henry's House is a gem - tucked away at the end of the street in Ortigia with stunning views of the Ionian sea. Our family loved the eclectic layout and found it comfortable and perfect for our needs. Enjoying an \"aperitivo\" on the terrace after a long day of sight-seeing was a lovely way to wind down. But the best part of Henry's House is the staff - Sabrina, Naomi and Massimo were so helpful and friendly - we were sorry to leave!","35151":"We stayed for 3 nights and really enjoyed the hotel. The staff was very friendly and helpful, the breakfast was very good, and the view of the bay from our room was beautiful.\nWe would absolutely stay here again.","35152":"We booked this hotel based on raving reviews, however, we were surprised by the uneven, rambling nature of the interior on arrival. On closer look, it seemed the entire hotel was furnished with unmatched, second-hand, cheap furniture, carefully masked with multicolor paints. Our room was noisy not because it faced the street, but because the door and the walls were thin: we could hear every step landed in the staircase in the middle of the night. The terraces offered a fantastic vista of the ocean and sun downers would have been so romantic if it hadn\u2019t been for the ramshackle, rusty tables and chairs. What seemed ridiculous was that every inch of the walls in the public rooms was covered with very mediocre contempory paintings, seemingly produced by a single artist (this artist has also painted all the bins\u2014vanity or boredom?) This hotel should do an honest round of renovation: to improve the quality of the doors and walls, the sanitary ware in the bathrooms, and last but not least, replace the ugly furniture and paintings, so as to justify the room rates. That said, the receptionists were super, genuinely helpful and friendly, consistent with the reputation of Sicilian hospitality.","35164":"We wanted a base for a few days to explore Syracusa and Five Rooms B and B fitted the brief perfectly. The location overlooking the fountain of Piazza Archimedes on the island of Ortigia was perfect and was very easy to find and a short walk from a large car park.\nThe entrance, behind an old door, is un assuming but the accommodation is excellent and the breakfast was great. The only slight drawback was that there were no windows except large skylights so no view of the Piazza which would have been nice.\nOverall enjoyable short stage and good value for such a good location although I would consider the other B & B in the same building but with a view.","35172":"The location is perfect. We had an attic room so no wall windows but a big skylight for air and light. The room was small but comfortable. The host was friendly and happy to give us second coffees at breakfast. Breakfast was good. For this price, this B and B is a great deal.","35213":"On this trip I was joined by my mom (Italian as me) and 4 friends from Denmark. The group was of a mixed age, with the youngest being 21, and the oldest 77.\nOur stay at Palazzo del Sale was outstanding from any prospective.\nFor starters, the place was immaculately clean, the food for breakfast was generous and delicious, but what made our experience extraordinary was the most attentive care and the warmth of Giovanni, the owner, Paolo and Claudia, who made breakfast and chatted with us over breakfast\/afternoon. They all made us feel at home. Coming back at the B& B from our day adventures in the island we were always welcomed by smily faces and an interested audience.\nGiovanni went out of his way to make us feel comfortable and assist us with any needs, from calling the cab to making reservation for dinner or whatever was asked.\nI will definitely come back here, so I strongly recommend considering this place for a formidable vacation in Ortigia, which is awesome, BTW!","35215":"We have just left after 3 nights in this wonderful 3* B&B. From its warm reception and perfect position you feel privileged to be able to stay. The inclusive breakfast is excellent as is Giovanni\u2019s personal recommendations for just about anything local. Don\u2019t make the mistake of trying to park your car mikes away, take advantage of the \u20ac20 per day valet parking as it really works like clockwork.\nA fabulous start to our holiday in Sicily, thank you Giovanni and your staff. Hope to return one day.","35220":"We felt welcome from the moment we arrived. We were greeted by Giovanni, who gave us a handy map, pointing out the points of interest and gave us some great recommendations. He also helped us with our luggage. Our room was large, clean, bright and airy with a private balcony, comfortable beds and great bathroom. There is a shared lounge with tea\/coffee, fruit and delicious homemade cake! This was a wonderful bonus to be able to relax in such a comfortable space. Palazza del Sale is an exceptional B&B, in a brilliant location and I would highly recommend it to anyone visiting Ortigia.","35221":"We definitely felt \u2018at home\u2019 at Palazzo del Sale. We felt its position at the south end of Ortigia was a bonus. It\u2019s a lovely building and our room was large with high ceilings and faced onto the street with a balcony which was great for our pre-dinner drinks. Giovanni was charmingly polite and very accommodating whenever we had a question or request. Breakfast was excellent and included home made cake. After b\u2019fast the room converted back to a comfortable living space with tea and coffee and cake available throughout the day and a chance to interact with other guests.\nLeaving our luggage for a few hours after checkout again was not a problem. We enjoyed meeting the other guests who also mentioned how at home they felt. Ortigia is gorgeous to visit and I would definitely recommend this hotel and stay again.","35222":"Our group stayed as four in two rooms on the uppermost floor over four days earlier this month and had an overall exceptionally good experience. The hotel is charming and the off-room outdoor terraces were wonderful. Giovanni is a warm, friendly host who made us feel welcome and appreciated. The rooms were very well appointed with plenty of space, great air conditioning, nice bathrooms, and very comfortable beds. The facility was completely renovated 10-12 years ago. Renovations were done in a way that highlights many of the historical features of the property. I enjoyed the wall cutaways that showed ancient, original walls throughout the building! Breakfasts were very nice with the breakfast staff kind and very attentive.\n\nOverall the hotel location and quality is exceptional - highly recommended.","35223":"We loved the position, being so central to walk both along the coast of Ortigia and into the hub to an incredible range of wonderful places to eat, have a drink or simply to sit and watch the world go by! Our apartment was spacious and well-appointed and we loved being able to go up the stairs and outside onto our own terrace. Despite being one road behind the sea front, there was a view to the sea between the buildings in front and to the right of us. Giovanni was charming and offered some very good restaurant recommendations. He has a great team working with him. The breakfast spread was excellent too. Thank you Giovanni for sorting out our last night's accommodation for us - it was wonderful and a delight to meet your sister!","35224":"The owner Giovanni is one of the most charming and. Helpful hosts I have ever met\nNoqthing was too much to organize, from a reccomendation of a top restaurant to making. His friend Aurora Vailable for an expertly guide de tout of Syracuse","35235":"This hotel\/ B and B lives up to its excellent reputation. We arrived to a warm welcome from the ever helpful Giovanni, We were shown to the room we had booked and Giovanni was confronted with a leak in the bathroom. Plumbing problems happen anywhere but totally non plussed Giovanni organised another and in many ways better room. The hotel and staff are a joy. 5 star. Heather and Richard Skelton.","35237":"Stayed for two nights. Because you can only check in at certain times we emailed and confirmed our arrival time beforehand, as per the request of the owner. Upon arrival no one was there and although I called more than 20 times there was no reply so waited more than 2 hours. When eventually the owner arrived this was still late for their \u201copening time\u201d. Room was ok but bed was hard and towels not changed during our stay. Good recommendation for dinner and some helpful insight but did not really recover the arrival experience.","35241":"We stayed a week at this pleasant hotel in Ortigia. The location was excellent with restaurant and tourist sites near at hand. Swimming beaches were also close by ( a choice to suit the wind direction). The buffet breakfast was delicious and included excellent coffee brought to our table. Angelo, our host, could not have been more friendly and helpful, providing assistance with bookings and general advice during our stay. We were made to feel very welcome. Our room was very clean and comfortable. Thank you Palazzo del Sale for leaving us with happy memories of Ortigia.","35242":"We stayed a week in this lovely hotel with very attentive staff, very clean and a good breakfast each morning. Close to many restaurants and free beach.\nAngelo in particular was helpful with anything asked eg towels for the beach, tour information and bookings, and our taxi back to Catania Airport. Enjoyed our stay immensely.\nAn added service of airport pick-up and return would be helpful to those who don't have a car.","35256":"A great, relaxed place to stay, huge gorgeous room with terrace, very comfortable bed and perfect pillows. Very clean. excellent bathrooms. Lovely and big breakfast and very helpful staff. The location is terrific in the South of Ortigia - turn either way and you are at the sea in 2 minutes! You don't get daily cleaning and the reception is only open certain hours as this is a B and B not a hotel - but this was not a problem for us.","35257":"We also enjoyed our stay at Palazzo del Sale. Giovanni was very accommodating for our late-night arrival.The location was perfect for exploring and the rooms were large and clean. We only wish that Giovanni had been either been at the front desk more often during his hours or that there was another way to locate him during those hours for questions and for check-out, when it came time.","35258":"We really enjoyed our 10-day stay in the Blu room, for the following reasons:-\n1) The room was spacious, quiet, clean, comfortable and well decorated, with high ceilings\n2) The room had a terrace; ideal for reading and relaxing\n3) The breakfasts were more than adequate, with a good selection, which altered each day\n4) Giovanni, the co-owner, was helpful, as was Moumina, who served breakfast and cleaned our room\n5) We liked at once the character and atmosphere of Via Santa Teresa, in which the hotel is situated, and the rest of the southern tip of Ortigia\n6) The room has an A\/C unit, which we kept on at night. T\n\nThe hotel is but a short walk from the Lungomare Alfeo on the west coast of the island (with a row of restaurants and cocktail bars), and the Lungomare di Ortigia on the east coast. We preferred the restaurants in the streets around Via Santa Teresa, such as the Osteria Mariano, the Il Tempio di Athena, and the Vecchio Pub, all of which I shall review separately.\n\nA minibus - route 1 - stops nearby (on both the west and east sides) on its way round Ortigia and over the bridge to 'mainland' Siracusa. Amongst other places, the minibus stops at the bus station, which is very close to the train station. The frequency of the service is a little erratic, but is about every 25-30 minutes. There is a flat fare of 1 euro, which is paid into the machine on board the bus.\n\nWe used the bus sometimes to return to the hotel from the station, after a heavy day's touring. However, it takes only just 30 minutes or so to walk from the hotel to the bus and train stations - the best route is to walk down the Foro Vittorio Emanuele II, then, after reaching the marina, to turn right and walk across one of the bridges, and then follow the Corso Umberto I, and then down the Via Francesco Crispi at the bottom of which is the train station to the right, and the bus station to the left.\n\nNearly all of Siracusa's sights are walkable, even when the weather is hot, as each street has its shady side.\n\nJust a suggestion: it would be nice if there were a few more plants on the terrace, such as another hibiscus, some jasmine, and perhaps a pot-grown lemon or orange tree which could be trained up one of the high walls. (The Moroccans often do this kind of thing in their roof terraces.)\n\nAll in all, we enjoyed our stay very much, and would return if we decide to re-visit the area.","35259":"What a charming small, boutique hotel this is - I'm so glad we chose Palazzo del Sale ... the room was perfect, location great and the uniqueness was what made this such a lovely spot to spend 3 days in Ortigia. Our room was at the back with the canopy over the bed, just a small balcony but it was quiet which was nice. The bathroom is fine although I've never been in such a small shower! The continental breakfast has the usual, salami, fruit, cereal, cheese and with an excellent cappuccino it's all you need all day!\n\nGiovanni (who speaks great English) suggested 3 restaurants, a fabulous fish restaurant (definitely have the mussels with Gorgonzola) - called Divino Mare, also Taverna Sveva where the pasta was delicious and tonight we go to I'Gnuri.\n\nThe hotel was a great find and I would definitely recommend to anyone wanting something small, classy and unique.","35356":"Very clean, excellent location. Very big rooms with a very huge bed. Very friendly staff and very helpful. You can take a ride the town with the bicycle provided for free. Worth the visit. It used to be a convent so there are still some nuns whom are very nice and keeps you company","35360":"I stayed one night at the hotel. My room was a small single room with a bed, a small desk and a chair. The bed and pillows were comfortable. The air conditioning was a bit noisy so I used earplugs. The service at the hotel was very good and friendly.","35365":"A very pleasant base, easy walking distance from centre of old town and delighted to find that it was much quieter than many of the hotels nearer the marina. Also easy walking distance from the platforms set up for swimmers to cool off in the beautiful clear waters of the bay. Room with a view over the bay a real bonus.","35375":"We had a delightful stay here in October 2018. We arrived after lunch and were very hungry but a torrential downpour prevented us from leaving the hotel anytime soon. The front desk receptionist went to the (closed) restaurant and got us some bread & cheese and fruit. Talk about customer service! The room was very nice and clean. Location was convenient to Syracusa sightseeing. Their recommendation for dinner was spot on.","35377":"Lovely hotel, very clean and comfortable . Had a water view for our room. Easy to walk to active areas of the city. The hotel is connected to a church and partially run by nuns. Lovely, spacious dinning room with two connected rooms, a large selection of baked goods and fruit offerings.","35380":"We had a sea view, the room was big and the bathroom was also big. It was beautifully cleaned, the chapel was fabulous. Breakfast was what you would expect cold meats cheeses and bread. The roof top terrace was lovely, close to all the sights. Free parking was great\nEnjoyed our stay","35383":"Last minute find as we arrived in Syracuse without a place to stay and walked around to find this hotel. This was a beautiful hotel in the old part of Syracuse where the staff were all very friendly and helpful. The rooms were very spacious and nicely decorated as well as clean. The hotel was a short walk to main attractions in Syracuse as well as restaurants and swimming places. Would definitely recommend staying here.","35387":"We stayed at Domus Mariae Benessere for a week in a twin room with sea view. The room was generously sized, as was the bathroom and was simply furnished but spotlessly clean. The air conditioning was quiet and efficient, which was a relief after 30 degrees outside, although the public areas of the hotel - especially the glass lift - can be quite warm. The hotel is situated in a quiet but well placed area of Ortigia, so it is easy to walk to all the historical sites in only a few minutes. We found the reception staff to be very helpful with bus timetables and general information. We loved the calm and peaceful air of the hotel and found the inclusion of the beautiful church made it extra special. Although there are religious paintings and artefacts around, we found this added to the experience rather than detracted. The only area for improvement would be the breakfast - although there was a reasonable choice of pastries, breads, cheese and ham, I would have liked a greater variety of fruit and fruit yoghurts for a lighter breakfast.\nOrtigia is lovely, with many great buildings and restaurants, plus it\u2019s relatively easy to get around without a car. A twenty minute walk from the hotel takes you to Syracuse bus station, from where we went to the beautiful beach at Fontane Bianche and the Baroque city of Noto, both well worth visiting.","35388":"I spent 3 days in Syracuse nice location , all the stuff was very nice , room so clean and I used the spa where Valentina is so professional !\nI would like to come back but it depends from the rate because the rate room s goes from 54 euro till 450 euros ... yes you well understood !!","35390":"The hotels was a bit of treat for us. We wanted a room with an ocean view and we got it. It was not the largest window but it is an ancient building and the shape of the window was so well pronounced when the sunrise came in. The breakfast was great, lots of selection with in house made yogurt. I saw in some reviews about religious based hotel, I saw none of that. There is a chapel, quite nice looking, and a nun or two wandering around but to say this is a religious based is a falsehood. There is a rooftop patio where people can look out to the sea or just rest outside. there is an inward courtyard where you can also rest. My wife and I had food poisoning (NOT FROM THE HOTEL) and we needed bed rest. The room was perfect for that. The staff were helpful, kind and approachable. The hotel is a 5 minute walk from the famous market and the parking lot. Also very well located to start a walk around or in Ortigia. No issues. It is a lovely island and a lovely hotel.","35391":"From arrival to departure this was a succession of disappointments. From the minute I walked in and saw the bad taste with which the ancient building had been restored, I knew I would be disappointed. I went with my boyfriend and we had (obviously) booked a double bed. To our surprise, we were given twin beds, and they were fully booked so unable to change our room. On top of the twin bed disaster, it also turned out the room was overlooking a small interior patio with a sitting area - Little sofas placer RIGHT beside our room window, so one was basically forced (for a little privacy) to have the shutters closed, which is a little claustrophobic to say the least...\nNext and final disappointment: To use the swimming pool, one has to pay EXTRA! Yes, on top of the room rate, which is not particularly cheap for such as awful little hotel, one has to pay (listen to this...) 20 EUROS PER PERSON PER HOUR to use the swimming pool... honestly, I have never experienced this anywhere in the world... When you pay to stay at a hotel, you OBVIOUSLY have access to the swimming pool... specially if it was one of the features that made you book it in the first place!!\nAnyway, not enough words to complain... DON'T STAY HERE!!\nOh yes I was forgetting, final cherry on the cacke: Check out is at 10:30 AM!!","35392":"We stayed 2 nights here.\n\nA fantastic location on Ortigia, within walking distance to all of the main attractions on Ortigia, and there is a 5 Euro hop on\/ hop off bus stop within a 5 minute stroll. This can take you over to mainland Siracusa to see the Greek Theatre\/ Catacombs etc. Tickets valid all day.\n\nThe rooms were well appointed. Very clean and modern. Showers powerful with plenty of hot water, great aircon.\n\nBreakfast nice, the usual Sicilian sweet treats, you can pay extra for scrambled eggs\/omelette if you wish.\n\nOne receptionist was super friendly and helpful (can\u2019t remember her name but on duty when we arrived on the afternoon of 28th.. Lucia or Lydia maybe). Helped us to stay another night and gave us good advice about the area.\n\nThe big disappointment about the hotel is I researched to stay somewhere with a pool. You have to pay 20 Euro per person for an hour to use it. A bit steep! You do get it exclusively, but must book in advance and time slots are quite restricted. We didn\u2019t bother. So if you want a pool take this into consideration.\n\nThe rooftop area is nice to chill out on.","35393":"Old fashioned religiously focussed hotel. The spa was not accessible since one needs a treatment to access the baths. The sea view for the room was visible through a tiny window. During breakfast the TV was on the whole time. Quality of breakfast lacked behind most other locations. Overall a no recommendation from our side.","35394":"Everything was according our expectations. The rooms are very large and well sound proofed. The beds was huge and comfortables. The location is perfect for the visit of the heart of the city. The breakfast was excellent especially for the sweet parts. The staff very professional and efficient.\n\nThe Wi-Fi connection was quite poor and needs to be reconnect with password every time you reopen your device.","35396":"Siracusa is lovely, and Domus Mariae Benessere goes with the town. The hotel has everything you need, and that's more than enough for one's comfort.The staff at the reception is quite sympathetic; they even sent someone with me to show where the terrace was - although it's well explained even in your room. Breakfast was fairly good. The first view from the terrace will make you thrill about the town you are about to visit. Excellente location.","35401":"We stayed in Domus during a guided tour of Sicily and found this hotel met our needs and then some. Beautifully maintained and very peaceful. Being a former convent, there is even a small chapel for the faithful which holds masses on certain days. The staff was very helpful. The location near the center of town was very convenient and the ocean is just out front of the hotel. We didn't use the spa but other people in the group did and could not praise it enough. Definitely, a hidden gem in our opinion.","35407":"Great location close to the centre of Ortigia and a great view of the ocean.\nRooms are spacious and very clean.\nGreat service from the staff.\nBreakfast had a variety of cereal, cold cuts, yogurt, fruit and of course juices, tea and coffee.","35412":"This property is a renovated convent in a convenient location in Siracusa's Ortiega island. Nuns actually still run the hotel and a handful of retired nuns live amongst the hotel guests. Rooms are on the smaller side, but clean and well appointed. We had requested a front facing sea view room which was a liability Friday and Saturday nights. Locals had parties in the adjacent park along the beach both nights and I was only able to sleep using earplugs. Sunday night, with Monday being a work day, all was quiet. Light sleepers might consider a courtyard view if staying over a weekend night. Good wi-if (13Mb down) is available in the rooms, but you will need to inconveniently re-enter the password for every session. Front desk service is extremely friendly and helpful.\nUnlike some of the reviewers, we thought it was a special experience to stay with a religious order.","35413":"The hotel had a good location. We had a \"sea view\" room, and technically, it had a sea view, but it was a tiny little window, so not worth the extra money for that. The room was very tiny. Though the bathroom was large the outdated shower was miniscule (2'x2'?) and wouldn't drain well so I kept shutting off the water and turning it back on. Everyone on staff was nice, and I knew there was a religious ownership, but too many crosses and Madonna and child photos, etc for my liking. It just made me feel a bit like I was staying in a convent.","35414":"I accidentally put in the wrong date for this hotel while booking seven hotels for my vacation. I noticed the mistake right away and called to change the reservation with the correct date. The hotel refused to refund my credit card for the booking even though I said I would re-book for the correct dates. I literally booked this Hotel three minutes earlier! I ended up booking at different Hotel. Be wary of a Hotel with such poor ethics.","35436":"We stayed at Casal Sikelio for a week in August and it\u2019s as beautiful as it looks in the pictures.\n\nWe had a studio room which was obviously small but had everything we needed. Modern bathroom and small but perfectly formed kitchen that had a good sized fridge and a full oven. There is a table and chairs outside of the room with it\u2019s own private fenced area and we ate out there most days.\n\nThe pool area is amazing and considering there are only 6 apartments, it\u2019s enormous! There were quite a few days where we had it to ourselves and lounged around in the lovely weather.\n\nThere are outdoor barbecues which we used a lot to make meals on. They are right by the pool and a great spot to cook on.\n\nYou definitely need a car if you are staying here and want to explore. It is walking distance to the nearest village though and we walked up on some evenings and had some excellent pizza there. It was nice to be able to have access to restaurants and shops within walking distance and then have a car for during the day.\n\nThe family are very friendly and helpful and made staying here a pleasure.","35438":"We fell in love with this place from the start . The hospitality that Antonio gave us. ordering pizza(arrived late) and showing us around. We had 2 rooms , one upstairs with big veranda ( a lot of sun) and one down stars. Clean and good beds. New clean towels every day , and our dishes was taken care of. Great garden with pool relaxing area , sunbeds. Parking inside gates . Highly recommend this place. You can rent the hole place or just an apartment. We used airbnb,","35443":"We actually stayed here 28-30th May 2017 - we are catching up on our reviews!\nThis is a lovely tranquil location and has stunning views.\nWe visited with our baby son (he was nearly one). The pool and grounds were lovely and there was even a little swing in the lemon groves.\nThe room was decorated to a high standard but was really small even just for the three of us. Compared to the outside balcony which was massive and perfect for a toddler. We ate on the balcony.\nIt was just the inside space that stopped us from giving 5 stars.\nThe surrounding areas are not too touristy which is how we like it and we visited a lovely restaurant recommended by the owner for Sunday lunch.\nDefinitely worth a visit.","35446":"Casal Sikelio deserves a 10+ on a scale from 1 to 10. Our apartment was spacious and had all the comfort we could think of, including our own private terrace. The garden and swimming pool were simply a WOW, we loved it. What completed it all: Antonino and his family and staff. They were very welcoming and helpful, making us feel at ease and wanting to stay longer. A powerful mix of hospitality and proudness. And the two kittens ...... we could hardly resist to kidnap them!","35449":"5 stars does not do Casal Sikelio justice, and if there was a 6th it would be receiving it.\n\nThe great sized pool (perfect for splashing about and big enough for lengths), beatifully kept gardens (a real highlight, The Chelsea Flower Show would be impressed!) and the fully equipped apartments were all to the highest standard.\n\nThe staff and especially our host Antonio could not have been more helpful and great, with the rooms cleaned promptly and professionally, and Antonio really being the perfect host.\n\nA really perfect stay, and I can't wait to return.","35450":"We thought Casal Sikelio was paradise. Surrounded by lemon, orange and olive trees, this beautifully modern, stylish converted farmhouse was the ideal place to relax and unwind. A highlight for us was the gorgeous pool situated in well maintained and stunning gardens.\n\nAntonio, the host, will go out of his way to make sure you enjoy your time here, and experience Sicily at its best. He will provide you with a list of his favourite local attractions and give you advice on how to get the best out of what time you have in Sicily. He clearly loves his job and was a pleasure to chat to.\n\nAbout a 5 minute walk away is a supermarket, bakery, fish mongers and butcher. There's also some lovely pizzerias in town if you don't want to cook in the apartments. A 15 minute walk away is the beach of Fontane Bianche, a busy and crowded tourist beach with a few bars and restaurants. However, Antonio will give you directions to another \"secret beach\" close by that's equally as beautiful as Fontante Bianche, however significantly quieter. Siracusa is a nearby city that provides lots of historical and architectural sites, with plenty of bars, cafes and restaurants for a cold beer and a pizza.\n\nDue to a mess up with our car hire, we did everything by walking, caught the train (which was very reliable), and Antonio even gave us a lift to the city so we didn't miss out on the experience, but we would recommend a car.\n\nWe loved Casal Sikelio. We will defiantly be returning and hopefully soon!","35451":"Casal Sikelio is a small boutique property with currently only 7 apartments. I stayed with my mum for 7 nights in May and we were highly impressed on all accounts.\n\nThe apartment was exceptionally clean, had comfy beds and was well appointed with all necessary equipment. Each also had its own outside terrace\/patio which was covered in jasmine blossoms. The grounds are stunning and well appointed with a gorgeous good sized pool, which despite being slightly chilly we were still able to swim in in May. There were also plenty of sun beds for the number of guests, and herbs, orange and lemon trees that guests are able to help themselves to.\n\nWe did not hire a car and were able to get around by bus and train (to Syracuse, to see a play in the Teatro Greco and to Noto to see the annual flower festival) and the owners very kindly helped us out with lifts to get to a local supermarket, restaurants and the gorgeous local Fontaine Bianche beach. However, we would recommend a hire car.\n\nIt was a pleasure getting to know Antonino, the passionate and exceptionally welcoming host of Casal Sikelio. He was extremely helpful, able to answer all of our questions and incredibly accommodating with any need we had.\n\nWe would definitely recommend to friends and hope to be back soon!","35453":"The service was hands down the best ive ever had and we travel quite a bit! The apartment was lovely, and everything was above and beyond our expectations. If this place is within your budget, book here!! We will be coming back with friends to show the place off to them. It's such a great find. Antonino was a wonderful host, always helpful, but also gave us our privacy too. Absolutely perfect. One night we ordered pizza through him from a local shop, and he arrived at our apartment with it. The shop wasn't delivering yet, so he drove himself to pick it up for us!!","35456":"We turned up here without a reservation after the place we originally booked was being renovated without telling us! Antonio and his colleague were happy to welcome us and show us the resort at such short notice. The owners are genuinely warm, nice people and just aim to please. When you walk out onto the pool area it is breathtaking. The expanse, the quiet. The whole place has been renovated and has only been open a few years. Our room and the resort were incredibly clean. Our 3 year old son loved to play with Antonio every day and he didn't mind at all. Cassible is a quiet place, but is perfectly placed right in the middle of Siracusa (20 mins) and Noto (30 mins). We really enjoyed a quiet place to come back to and such lovely people that take care of everything. Thank you so much, we will be back.","35478":"We were unfortunate to only be able to spend 3 days in Casal Sikelio. Set in a large beautiful garden, Antonino hosts a maximum of 7 cosy and well decorated, newly renovated and designed apartments, each approx 40m2 with a large patio and comfortable kitchen space and bath room. Felt very welcome - as if the place were ours! Beautiful large pool (it could host 5x times the guests, no kidding) with baby\/toddler section. Lot of privacy and the small amount of staff goes lengths to make your stay totally carefree.\nThe house doesn't offer bar, breakfast or diner yet plenty of smaller supermarkets and bakeries in the nearby (500m) village Cassibile. Good restaurants in the vicinity (Casal Sikelio provides a list of their recommendations, which we tried and loved). Avola, Noto and Siracusa all within a 20 min drive.\nAll in all a great place and one to recommend and come back to. If I had to name 1 point of improvement it were that the amount and variety (eg breadknife, sharp cutlery for fruits) of cutlery and pans in the otherwise well equiped kitchen could be stocked up a bit. Maarten Koning","35528":"Great B and B for visiting Syracuse and seeing the sights. Outside the town but an easy drive in. Air conditioning in the room and also a mini fridge. Good breakfast.\nLovely hosts. Rooms very clean. Secure parking. Definitely recommend","35596":"We somehow managed to find this hotel in the dark having landed at Catania Airport 5 hours earlier!\nSplendidly quirky beach hotel with a lovely garden and 2 minutes walk from a sandy beach.\nThe Villamare has some of the most charming staff we have met anywhere in the world they really are a class act and nothing is too much trouble for them.\nThe rooms are perfectly OK and the breakfast 5 star with a staggering choice of food including English breakfast!\nThe Hotel is well placed for exploring Siracuse, Ortigia and Noto so I would strongly recommend it.","35599":"We loved our stay at this beautiful small hotel!!! Everything about it was perfect for us - half a block to the sea with a white sand beach and clear blue water, amazing garden and pool area, clean comfortable rooms...... but it is the staff that makes Hotel Villamare so special. They were so friendly and accommodating, making sure we were comfortable and addressing every question and request quickly. I cannot say enough about our stay here, and would recommend it to anyone!","35602":"Just returned from a very comfortable stay in the Hotel Villamare. We had three rooms all individually decorated and extremely clean and comfortable. All had an outdoor seating area and great air con, which is a must in the August heat! I was pleasantly surprised with the spaciousness of the rooms as previous reviews described them as small and I had warned the family beforehand. It was not the case at all! The triple room with 3 adults might be a little cosy but the balcony was large and a huge bathroom to compensate. The third bed is a full size single dressed as a sofa but no compromise on comfort at all. All the linens were beautiful and crisp. The beds really comfy. There was ample storage in all rooms and the eco- friendly nature of the hotel is appreciated.\nThe breakfast in the hotel has a vast choice including hot and cold items and local specialities all delicious! There was plenty of choice for anyone with allergies or intolerances.\nThe location of the hotel is so convenient for a wide popular sandy beach. Also very quick and easy to travel to Ortigia, Noto and the surrounding areas. Fontane Bianche has only a couple of restaurants so night life is very low key.\nWe enjoyed after dinner drinks in the garden with lovely snacks- (Paula gin & tonic!) Hotel drink prices were expensive but that is to be expected when you have such a small hotel providing individual service.\nClaudia and the rest of the hotel staff were warm and friendly and went out of their way to be helpful, nothing was too much trouble. Excellent customer service. Thank you.","35608":"The moment you arrive you get a splash of smells from the flowers surrounding the entrance, and that follows you the entire stay. I have never seen such a small place decorated so lovely and used so smart. You have a feeling of very cosy and very tendered place, with excellent customer care from the staff. We stayed there for 5 days and enjoyed it, their garden is beautiful to sit and have dinner at, and the food is fabulous. Our room was very small, and that was the only thing we could\u2019ve changed if we wanted. Public beach is just 2 minutes of walk from the hotel, but it is quite busy and not so enjoyable considering the crowd. Train station is 20minutes of walk, we used it to visit nearby Noto. All the cudos to the staff!","35611":"Small, friendly hotel just one block from the beach. Comfortable rooms and excellent service, including an early breakfast on our departure. The garden and pool area is beautiful, immaculate and tranquil. Undercover parking very useful on hot days. Drinks and food a little on the expensive side but there is a good selection of restaurants within walking distance. Easy travel to Syracuse, Noto and other baroque towns (by bus or train if wished), so plenty to see and do. Just 45 minutes from Catania airport. In summary, a delightful place for a relaxing week.","35613":"Beautiful hotel set in a gorgeous garden in close walking distance to the beach. The staff are incredibly warm and friendly and do everything they can to help and assist. From the moment we arrived the charming staff were helping us with our luggage, providing a welcome coffee and homemade biscuits to us and our friends and doing everything they could to make our stay comfortable. The dinner was lovely and the breakfast in the beautiful garden was sumptuous and delicious with gratis espresso coffees provided exactly according to our requests. The swimming pool looks lovely but unfortunately during our stay the weather was not warm enough to use it. I cannot recommend this hotel enough and just wish we could have stayed longer.","35618":"We were there in June. An amazing place! Unique! Comfortable beds, beautiful rooms, amazing atmosphere. The plants in the garden grabbed me! It is like you are in heaven! Lovely pissalon! I recommend!","35634":"The hotel is surrounded by a garden that smells and looks gorgeous. There are only 16 rooms and you feel intimate, it is so quiet and nice that you want to stay forever. Best sand and Walter I have ever seen in Sicily!!! Best breakfast! Staff very polite and helpful! Congratulations!","35636":"The locaction was great, 2 minutes from the beach. They served delicious breakfast, a lot of things to choose from, from sausages to croissants. The garden was very nice and clean, with sounbeds. We had a room with a partial see view, which was nice as in the evenings you could hear the sea. We were there in October and remember that this is low season so most of the restaurants are closed, hotel restaurant as well. There are 3 places where you can eat on the beach but opened only till 15 and a place with a really nice and cheap food- a gas station 15 minutes from the hotel\n\nThe pool was not warm but probably as it was the end of the season restaurant was closed, the same reason as above","35639":"We stayed 6 nights at this friendly small hotel directly by the Sea.\nOur room unfortunately was a little dark because it only has one window, but otherwise fine. Good size bathroom with a nice shower. Very comfortable and soft bed. When we arrived we were welcomed with a free bottle of white wine.\nSmall pool with sun beds - lovely and quiet. The beach is only a few steps away.\nThe staff and the food really make this place very special. A big thank you especially to Michele, Stefania and Christina - you are wonderful :-).\nWe initially booked bed and breakfast but on arrival decided to go for half board and were glad we did. The food is just outstanding - real Sicilian - the menu changes every night and on Saturday night they treat you with a Sicilian style buffet and home made pizzas - there are no words for it. Please try the dinner - you will not be disappointed.\nWe can highly recommend this small hotel. Grazie mille :-)","35642":"We booked this by chance. It has very nice garden, comfortable rooms, and enough parking place together with friendly and polite staff. The kitchen is savoury. The small but good beach is in walking distance. You can reach Siracusa in 20 minutes.","35661":"For us the location was perfect. walking distance from the railway station and even closer to the Ortygia. We had a very good room on the top floor with a view and easy access to two terraces. Good bathroom. Every thing was clean. We needed icecubes for drinks. Not easily availble but the staff was most helpfull.","35663":"The breakfast was a bit poor. The staff is .. no sure, one person attended to us phenomenally but another was a bit unfriendly and very busy with his phone. In the morning, very early when we wanted to check-out, we were not allowed to pay the 3 euros fees with the credit card and we waited more than 15 minutes for the return of a 20 euros ticket. I didn't think it was right, because we were in a hurry and we had an appointment at another place, we were late to. Otherwise, the hotel is fine, basic, clean and the location is good. 5 minutes from the most important city.","35683":"Spacious room ! Renovated furnishings ! Super air-conditionig ! Roomy bathroom ! Good breakfast ! Polite staff ! Good price ! I don't know what is reason for so many negative comments about this good value hotel with central location.","35691":"Just stayed one night at this lovely hotel. The absolute best hotel staff, Serena was amazing, helped my daughter and I with so many enquiries. Breakfast was continental with everything you need including great coffee. An easy walk from the station and to the island. Clean and roomy. Thankyou.","35693":"We booked four nights in Siracusa Sicily in the Le Muse Hotel. Little did we know when we checked in on Friday, that the hotel sat on top of a disco that blasted music from 11:00 pm to 3:00 am. The noise from the disco and crowd below from four different restaurants was deafening. Even ear plugs did nothing to help. Needless to say we checked out of the hotel the next day because we could not be moved until Sunday and at that could not be guaranteed quiet rooms. It was a disaster to say the least. Expedia Said they would cancel the remaining three nights if the hotel agreed. The hotel, of course, did not agree so we paid for four nights to a hotel we could not sleep in. Expedia should have been on our side. The hotel lied to us and to Expedia. I am also disappointed with Expedia.","35694":"A beautiful experience. Hotel location was very good, close to the little buses operating there and close to Ortigia. The room was excellent, clean and big. Hotel staff extremely helpful. Breakfast was also great. Free wi-fi was always available. We loved the experience and would go back anytime.","35695":"Our first time in Siracusa, so we looked for a hotel that offered us a great night's sleep after a long drive from the west coast of Sicily. Le Muse happened to be on this great street, Via Malta, as we entered the city. Upon inquiring, they matched the price we had seen it advertised online and we decided to deal directly with the hotel. It offered an elevator, a nice reception area with a kind and friendly receptionist (Deborah, I believe), a beautiful and very spacious room, with an unusually big bathroom, facing the street and a yummy breakfast, included in the price. It is located just a couple of blocks away from Ortygia, straight down on Via Malta, where we crossed the bridge onto that beautiful and historic part of Old Town Ortygia. I definitely would stay at this hotel again. It was a great sleep and a superbly-functioning A\/C!","35696":"No parking on site, we were given a room with an invalid bathroom for some inexplicable reason. The smell from the drain in the bathroom was overpowering made my partner sick! Other than that it was OK.","35759":"Let me start by saying the staff could not have been more friendly and helpful- thank you Domenica. When were there the poly tunnels were up so not the most pleasant surroundings. Plus the bird scarers boomed about every minute- hard to take a siesta by the pool; the latter is excellent by the way. The rooms are relatively small, minimalist with interesting lighting. Unfortunately our room was very damp and the ants flourished! Cleaning was either brilliant or non-existent, depending on the day.\nWe did not care for the breakfast- too much stodge.\nDinner was good but far from spectacular.\nLocation both for Syracuse and for further afield e.g. Noto, Modica is excellent.","35779":"We stayed at the resort for 10 days and found it to be a spotlessly clean, quiet and comfortable place run by very friendly and helpful people. The food was typically Sicilian and the menu varied daily. It was all prepared and cooked on on site and used many locally sourced foods. It was delicious. We would thoroughly recommend it but would suggest you have a hire car. We managed without but then we like walking. The bus to Siracusa is a 25 minute walk along lanes. The Excellent Lido at Arenella is 30 minutes walk but well worth it. It is very run and the sandy beach is beautifully clean and shallow clear waters. June is a good time to visit before the August heat. On a really clear day you can see Mt. Etna from the Resort grounds - 52 miles away.","35791":"Taking a wrong turn never turned out so well! The resort is tucked away off the beaten track, and yet only minutes from our hotel.\n\nWe turned up on a Thursday afternoon and, despite not being guests, were welcomed to dine that night.\n\nTraditional Sicilian fare was served, with fresh vegetables, local cheeses, excellent pasta and risotto dishes, with superb meat and fish. Desserts were familiar but with a local twist.\n\nSo impressed by the food cooked by capocuoco Antonella and ably presented by Ariana were we that returned two nights later. The boutique establishment is cosy and extremely friendly. For less that \u20ac30 each, the only problem is that it's too far from home to be regular visitors.\n\nYou'll probably need a car to get here, but it's well worth the trip.","35828":"I can only recommend this place! The B&B is clean and tidy, rooms are nice and bright. The staff is always polite and ready to help. The handmade cakes for breakfast are just delicious!! You will definetly feel at home here!!","35853":"Well equipped, clean, comfortable ensuite room with fridge and a\/c. Excellent position. Really welcoming and helpful hosts. A wonderful breakfast with all sweet things made by Mama. Delicious. I would recommend this place to anyone.","35854":"My wife booked up this B&B after trawling the internet for a few nights, and weighing up the pros and cons, and paying close heed to reviews for the property. It appeared to tick all the boxes for us.\nWe arrived on the 18th September 2017 for a three night stay.\nOn arrival at the exterior of the premises, in fact we had a little trouble finding it, we walked past it the first time! The exterior is not what, or where you would expect a B&B to look like, or be located. You had to enter through a security door, walk round a courtyard and then either walk up the stairs or take the lift. The lift was like something out of an old-fashioned movie, with a door you pulled out, and then you had to negotiate two small wooden doors to enter the lift itself, and the same rigmarole again to exit! It was at this point I thought to myself \"What on earth has my wife booked, and what awaits us next\"?!\nWe exited the lift, complete with cases, and here we were faced with the door to 'La Maison des Reves'. We made our presence known, and were shown in - WOW - it was like entering a completely different world, and I mean this in a very positive way. We were warmly welcomed, and issued a map by the gentleman at reception, who went on to point out relevant information and points of interest which he thought that we would be interested in, and this also included information about the buses. At this point we were too early to check in but were permitted to leave our cases and return at an agreed time.\nWe returned, and were met by a very pleasant young lady, and shown to our room, which was towards the end of the property, Room 10. Once more, like the gentleman we met earlier, the young lady couldn't have been more helpful in explaining the 'in's and out's' of the B&B.\nOur room was of a decent size, fresh, nice d\u00e9cor, and most importantly as far as we were concerned, it was very clean. There was a refrigerator in the room, our own separate en suite, and a small outside balcony with views, and looking over to the Santuario Madonna delle Lacrime (and for those that don't have a clue what I mean by that, let's just say it is a pyramid shaped church!).\nAt breakfast time there is no shortage of food. Typically continental style but there is plenty of choice including - bread, and this can be toasted, ham, cheese, croissants, cakes, fruit, yoghurt plus a lot more. They will try their best to accommodate for individual needs, for example if you want boiled eggs, all you need to do is just ask. My wife is coeliac and they were able to cater for her needs too without any trouble.\nTo sum up - we really enjoyed our stay here. We found the staff to be very welcoming, friendly and helpful. Breakfast was adequate for us. The B&B was very clean, modern and nicely decorated. It is a family run business, and it is clear to see that they are very passionate about their business, and customer satisfaction. Nothing was too much trouble for them. Would we stay here again? Most definitely, and would be very happy to recommend.","35855":"Very good breakfast, staff and WiFi. Big room. Noisy bed and shower with water too hot or too cold, with no control... Besides it didn't happen when we've tried to show it at check-out time, it really happened during our stay.","35856":"The room was clean and spacious, and the staff was very friendly throughout our stay BUT we felt the extra charge we paid for the balcony was not worth it! The balcony was tiny, filled with pots, and overlooking a super busy street filled with traffic and dust. We also missed having a kettle in the room for making tea.","35890":"Spent two nights here after arriving from US. We speak little Italian and Melita and her husband were able to help us with anything we needed. A bit of a walk from Ortigia but there is a bus stop five minutes walk which made it very convenient. The hop on hop off bus is there as well which was really handy for a day. Breakfast was amazing along with the cappuccinos! Rooms are nicely renovated and the courtyard is so pretty.","35892":"We stayed for three nights at Corte Sicular B & B with Melita & Paolo who are very friendly and welcoming. We do not speak much Italian but got by with both of us.\nLovely rooms in a beautifully restored building. Very clean, well appointed amenities. We were in the room close to the road but very little noise. The room was spacious. We did spend a bit of time in the afternoons in our room but didn't open the windows. Air conditioning worked well. Enjoyed the breakfasts and our stay here. Thanks.","35893":"A beautifully renovated building with a stunning stone walled courtyard to enjoy breakfast in.\nOur room was exceptionally clean with a lovely stone wall and comfortable bed. Nice bathroom with large shower.\nUnfortunate that we were on the road side of the building so we were unable to open the doors or curtains but there was only a little road noise and the aircon was silent so we slept well.\nThe room was smallish which was OK for a night but 2 or 3 may have felt a little closed it.\nBreakfast was an ample offering of sweet and savoury and the location was close to attractions such as the catacombs and Greek Theatre. Ortigia was a 20 minute easy and enjoyable walk.","35898":"Corte Sicula is a great place to be in Syracuse.\nIt\u2019s beautifully kept, very cosy and amazingly clean.\nIt\u2019s waking distance to Ortigia where you can have the most unforgettable dinners.\nThe owners are really nice and helpful.\nKids friendly.\nVery good breakfast\nIt\u2019s definitely a yes","35906":"We had a great two night stay at Corte Sicula. Rustic stone walls surrounding a quiet courtyard where a delicious breakfast is served. Very clean and quiet and most comfortable mattress ever! Not far on foot from the Greek ampitheatre in one direction or the Old Town of Syracuse in the other direction. Our hosts Melita and Paulo were very hospitable and helpful in terms of places to see and where to eat - strongly recommend and hope to return!","35910":"Wonderful B&B, with great amenities. We were on a driving holiday of Sicily and were looking for somewhere easy walking distance from the centre of Syracuse, but without the hassles of parking. This place could not have been better located. 10-15 min walk to Ortigia, and easy parking on the street. 10-15 min in the other direction, and you are at the archaeological site. The building is beautifully decorated. Beds were comfy and the air conditioning worked perfectly. Things we appreciate in a room. The wifi was the best we have had in any hotel. Even worked across the street, when packing our car. Hosts Melita and Paolo were so welcoming. Had a bit of a mix up with the booking, due to the website, and they helped us out straight away. Couldn\u2019t have asked for better help.","35918":"We stayed there for two nights. Room was clean and comfortable and furnished in class. Breakfast was very good too served by the host that were always there to listen if we needed anything. Will recommend to all even families.","35933":"In Syracuse for a late summer weekend we found Corte Sicula B&B an ideal refuge to explore the town. A 20-minute walk from Ortygia, this home from home run by Melita and Paolo Gradanti has all the creature comforts a family needs, and would also be ideal for a romantic getaway or solo travelers.\n\nWith comfy mattresses on the beds, spacious bedrooms and well-designed bathrooms the owners haven't skimped on furnishings and fittings, (it only opened two months ago) and the interior design of this lovingly renovated townhouse is bright, contemporary and elegant.\n\nBreakfast served in the interior courtyard - with fresh fruit, cakes, pastries, fruit juices and great coffee - is a treat. Paolo couldn't have been more help in advising on anything from where the most authentic Sicilian restaurant can be found to locating the nearest ATM, or finding a reliable car hire company at short notice. His generosity is unbounded and made our trip so much easier and enjoyable.\n\nThis is a perfect pied-\u00e0-terre for exploring Syracuse's delights and great value.","35945":"The grounds are lovely - however that is all that's going for this place. The owner is very stingy. Breakfast was bare bones - grocery store orange juice and some bread with cheese. You're in a farm surrounded by orange trees, but the oranges are only to see and smell from afar. The owner didn't even provide any toiletries - there was some hand soap and she told us to use that to shower and shampoo! This certainly isn't an agriturismo because you won't find anything 'agro' in your stay. There are dogs on the property which didn't stop barking all night long to add to the charm! Better places to stay - would recommend to avoid this one\n\nIf you decide to go here - be warned that the directions are quite tricky. Make sure you have the directions well mapped or you'll be driving in circles","36002":"Although the place is lovely, we did not find the service was good so the overall experience was not the best.\nThe room was big and clean but minimalist to the point were there was not even a glass or shampoo, just liquid soap. Beds were not made even though we stayed two nights. Breakfast, which is charged separately, was not worth the 7 euros per person: just tea\/coffee, toasts, yoghurt and a boiled egg. The AC was centrally activated....something we found out after struggling with the control for a while.\nOn the positive side, the host was very helpful with advice and suggestions.\nWith so many options in the area, I would stay somewhere else.","36015":"Beautiful b&b with big rooms, excellent bed, lovely breakfast, quite location close to syracuse","36020":"Our planned 4 nights turned into nearly two weeks of relaxing vacation - as it was the perfect place for us to stay. A good starting point to explore the rich culture, the stunning nature and the great, hospitable people of Sicily. As we enjoyed our first days so much and felt this couldn't get any better we decided to stay and spend our whole trip at La Frescura. Beautifully surrounded by lemon plantations we enjoyed delicious homemade breakfast under trees in the morning and excellent wine on the terrace in the evening. The old farm was carefully rebuild, which is visible in every lovely detail of the apartments.\nIda and her family are just great hosts and we felt very very welcome.","36022":"We stayed for 3 nights. Friendly welcome. Nice breakfast, though little choice (no cheese, no meatproducts). No restaurant (of which we were unaware on arrival, had to search for a decent restaurant late in the evening ...). Spacious room. Bathroom is not fitting up logical. No daily cleaning or towel replacement.\n\nNice place to stay when visiting Syracuse, Noto, Catania and Etna region.","36023":"We stayed at La Frescura for four nights at the end of September as part of our tour around Sicily. This is a fabulous little family farm with very warm and welcoming hosts (Ida gave us great advices on the sights and beaches around and is a very intelligent young woman), lovely home made breakfast, great location amidst the citrus trees with excellent view on Syracusa and the sea opening up from the top terrace. Our daughter Sophia enjoyed playing with the three dogs and two little kittens settled in our appartment during the stay (they must have liked our dinners :)). The appartments and rooms are simple, but clean, cosy and provide everything for comfort of the travellers. All in all - it is a great place for visit. We hope to be back some day.\nKatya & Matthew","36024":"We have been a week at La Frescura and it has been an excellent choice. Not far from Siracusa, good position to visit the whole area, the beach in Eloro is bueatiful and not too crowded.\nThe apartment was good and comfortable, people extremely friendly and the breakfast outstanding.","36033":"Terra mare pros and Cons\nWe took 3 rooms last September: 2 double and one single.\nBottom line it was very good.\nCons\n2 high floors + another one, the attic, withoutXwithout elevator\nIf bad knees or bad back... not for you\nNo safe in your room meaning you have to take your valuables, passports, money with you all the time if you feel you'll worry otherwise...\nproblem if you want to go to the beach\n1 set of key only (not a magnetic card), but it always like that with B'nB\nBut it also means that since usually you are a s couple you can't go doing different things since you won't be able to open the main door at the street.\nThe Single room: a window without a curtain nor shades so there is light early in the morning... preventing you from sleeping..Actually this was probably the main and worst Con.\nThe double room at the 2nd st floor had a balcony which was very good, however our double in the attic under the roof was ok but the window was on the roof meaning it could be opened only when there was no risk of rain\nMattress not firm (significant when you suffer from back problems)\nPillows very big, and only one instead of 2 of different size and firmness as usually you get 2 sorts: thick and thin, hard and soft...\nOurs were of one kind: big and not soft... again problems with back problems\nAnyway, my son's single, also in the attic, was not as good at because of the sunshine (morning light which I have already mentioned) , the mattress, which was not firm, and the window which couldn't be opened as much as we tried (perhaps we did it wrong)\n\nPros\nCristina, Lucia, Maria Helena are real nice people\nThe Breakfast was delicious and I'd even add Exceptional!\nRooms cosy (but very small)\nLocation: right in Ortigia, which is awesome and the reason we chose this BnB\nParking: perfect, at the foot of the BnB, 15\u20ac 24 hours, you can leave and come back using the same ticket, another of the choice main reasons\n\nBottom line, It was good, could be better, and I'm not sure if I'd come back...because of personal limitations.\nStill a very good 4 star rating as not everyone has difficulties climbing stairs, carrying heavy luggage, nor back problems demanding quality mattress and pillows.\nAlso for the Exceptional breakfast,\nAnd especially for Cristina, Lucia, Maria Helena who are really nice persons!\nMany pictures to help you make your mind.","36040":"The staff are amazing, and the rooms are clean, food is excellent but , after 8 lots of stairs when you are disabled is not good. Also the bedroom only had a window in the roof, and not in the walls, so a little bit like a prison.","36041":"This B and B far exceeded our expectations. On arrival we were met by Christina who with her fabulous staff carried our luggage up the stairs to our rooms. The rooms are beautifully presented with top class linen, super comfortable bed and lovely spacious bathroom. Breakfast on the roof terrace was superb with a huge variety of home made treats, fresh fruit and many other choices. The terrace is available to guests any time and we spent lovely evenings up there with wine, nibbles and the stunning views. We loved this B and B and would recommend to everyone travelling to Ortegia (Syracusa).","36044":"We spent two nights here after travelling from Noto. The owner of our accommodation in Noto had kindly called ahead for us to find out where we could park on arrival, being a busy weekend in August. We were given directions and found the place when we arrived. However, if you are visiting during the month of August be aware it is very busy and parking is an issue. My husband drove around the city several times looking for somewhere to park, and unable to do so he had to park across in Syracuse for two days. Others have mentioned that parking was not a problem, so maybe this is not the case outside of August, but just be aware. As others have also mentioned, this accommodation has no lift and is located three floors up. The rooms are lovely and owners welcoming, but I wouldn't recommend if you have extremely heavy luggage or find stairs an issue. That being said, once we were up the stairs we were warmly greeted by Christina, who gave us some information about the area, recommending certain places. The room was spacious with a large shower in the bathroom. The room had a small balcony, and if you looked sideways you could see the harbour. The view was actually the better from the terrace upstairs where breakfast is served. Breakfast was lovely, probably being one of the nicest we had in Sicily, with not just the usual cakes and fruit, but also savoury dishes too, accompanied by juices and coffee. The accommodation is well located to exploring the local sights and for the main bars and restaurants of an evening. With the exception of parking, we had a lovely stay here.","36045":"My parents and I spent two nights in a double and single room. The location is fantastic, just near the market in easy walking distance to everything. Rooms are serviced daily which was a pleasant surprise. Strong air conditioning and free, strong wifi and an excellent free breakfast on the terrace each morning. Exceptional value for money. The owner, Christina, and her family are just beautiful - the warmest people we've ever met, so welcoming and helpful. Highly recommend staying here, so long as you're okay with stairs to get up and down to the apartment from street level (approx three flights).","36052":"We really enjoyed to stay here for 1 night. Market place just outside and a wonderful terrace with a very good and relaxing breakfast.\n\nGood beds made a good sleep. We will come again if we visit Syracusa again","36054":"Had a cozy singe room at Terre e Mare! The location of the B&B is in Ortigia near the entrance as well as large free parking (along Riva della Posta). It's also close to Talete (undergound paid lot) and an open paid lot across from the B&B. In other words, finding parking won't be a problem! The best part of the B&B is having breakfast at their rooftop Terrace with views of the marina and Siracusa!\n\nJust know that there are no elevators and this B&B is on the top floor. Staff will help you with bags if needed.","36057":"I'm glad we chose this B&B for our overnight stop as it's in a fabulous location close to shops, restaurants and tourist sites.\n\nWe chose to park in the underground parking close by but you can park for free in another car park also very close.\n\nIt's a bit of a mission to get to the B&B itself as you have to climb a few flights of stairs, go through a door, along an outdoor landing and then into the B&B. To be fair, we were offered help with the luggage by the owner (very welcoming) but we only had one suitcase so could manage.\n\nOur room was very modern and spotlessly clean. But the skylight window didn't afford us any view of the city.\n\nHowever breakfast in the roof terrace the following morning gave us more view than we could have dreamed of. We had probably the best breakfast on the island and were very happy that we stayed here.","36082":"Centrally located on the Isola di Ortigia. Ten minutes walk to the famos catedral.\nVery friendly hosts. Good breakfast compered to other served in Sicily.\nWe felt like strolling  betwin centuries-old alleys.we have visited the Catedral , the Temple of Apollo, Archimedes Square and more. We ate in small taverns.Visited colorful markets around.","36121":"The whole stay was just perfect. Rooms are quiet and well organised, bunk beds are comfy, bathrooms clean, all the place is super beautiful generally speaking.\nThe staff was professional and helpful. I loved the cheap bar, drinks for as little as 3\u20ac. Lovely breakfast!\nIt is everything a hostel is supposed to be and a bit more.","36135":"I am solo woman traveller stayed at the LOL Hostel Siracusa 3 nights October 2016\n\nI booked a room with an ensuite.\n\nThe hostel is right behind the bus station, the train station just down the road, supermarket across the road, small bakeries, bars and a couple of restaurants nearby.\n\n15 minutes walk to the ancient island city of Ortiga and 15 minutes walk in the other direction to the Parco Archeologico della Neapolis.\n\nThe LOL Hostel is an old building that has been restored and \u2018modernised\u2019 railway line and high rise units behind the hostel.\n\nMy room had an ensuite TV\/AC refrigerator with a very large bed and a single bed both were on very low frames almost on the floor, both beds hard and uncomfortable and uncomfortable to get out of in the morning, sort of had to roll out on to the floor.\n\nHigh ceilings with high up windows that were only openable slightly. High ceiling lights and purple glass bed lights made it impossible to read at night. The bathroom had the best light for reading.\n\nThe bathroom shower door kept coming off its hinges while in the shower.\n\nThe blocks of high rise behind the hostel are flood lit at night, heavy purple vinyl was on the windows which killed off any ambience.\n\nBreakfast was croissants, instant and percolated coffee, Italian packaged toast marmalade. There is a community kitchen to cook if you wish and computers which you have to pay for. WiFi was in my room intermittent and slow.\n\nThe Hostel is in a great location, modernising old buildings is ok, however when it is impracticable like the low beds, high up windows and high ceiling lights I wonder. I found my bedroom to be rather bleak.\n\nI wish in hindsight that I have moved to another hotel.","36156":"My boyfriend and I have just come back from a 4 night stay at LoL hostel and we can't wait to stay there again when we visit siracusa. The staff are all really friendly and helpful. Our private room with a private bathroom was very clean and spacious. There was a fridge and TV which we weren't expecting in a hostel!!! We had a balcony which was nice to watch the italian life go by.\nOn our last night there we had a few drinks at the bar very affordable prices \u20ac1.50 for a glass of red wine (cheapest in the city) we sat outside which was really nice atmosphere, it was also really nice that we could have guest round for a drink at the bar!! I would highly recommend to stay here!!!","36160":"After the people of the railway didn't let us get on the train to Catania, we stuck in Syracuza. Fortunately, we found the hostel very easily as it's 100 meters from the station. The hostel was great: silent, clean, nice decorated with nice designed social area far away from the rooms (so it was silent in the rooms). Breakfast was also excellent.","36203":"Perfectly situated in the heart of Ortigia the B&B L'Acanto is wonderful. We had a spacious and lovely room, central yet perfectly quiet as set back in a courtyard. Mornings started with a fantastic breakfast enjoyed on the rooftop patio. Attentive care. Highly recommend.","36238":"BED & BREAKFAST : a lovely room with comfortable BED and a fantastic BREAKFAST (with genuine local products).\nWhat else? everything:\nGenerous and cozy staff that let you fell like home, an easy going atmosphere in a small, simple and very clean place. Then, outside the door, you'll find a charming old town where to get lost to find incredible places, astounding monuments from the origins of greek\/mediterranean culture, great caf\u00e9s and restaurants where you'll find what's probably one of the best cooking of south italian tradition, lovely people and a wonderful sea where to swim and just relax.","36293":"We didnt realise that the B&B was so far from town, about 5-10km, but the house & apartments were very comfortable & charming. As others have said, the hosts don't speak any English which made it especially hard for us & a culture shock on day 2. But it is surprising how you still manage to communicate. The hosts went out of there way to make us feel comfortable & the rooms were large, well appointed & ours very modern. They even gave us a choice of rooms so we stayed in the ones over looking the back. Restaurants are back in town so be prepared for a long drive at night. Breakfast was full of pastries which were delightful but I must say that the mosquitoes were bad in June.","36299":"Nice place to relax after the visits as it is a bit out of town. The view from the breakfast area and from our balcony (there is only one room with such a view, ask for it) is amazing, just like on the website. The owners are a very nice old couple helped out by their daugther. Breakfast is good with home made cakes. You can swim in the sea walking distance from the place but don't expect a beach, it's just rocks.\nWe had some difficulty to find the place. The indications on the website are not really sufficient and a precise map would help.\nAlso note there is no internet connection at the B&B","36312":"a well sited B&B just outside Siracuse lovely breakfast patio charming hosts","36318":"This B&B is wonderful. A newly constructed villa with all modern facilities located on a hillside overlooking a quiet bay and beach. The owners were helpful and friendly. Breakfast was great. We only wish we had planned to stay longer!","36335":"We had a very nice experience with Salvo\u2019s bed and breakfast! Salvo is a friendly host and he was very helpful with providing us tips for sightseeing, beaches and restaurants. He even let us borrow his beach umbrella and towels. Good location if you have a car, free parking in front of the guesthouse. About 15-20 drive to Siracusa\/Ortigia. We stayed in the \u201cMars\u201d room which was clean and spacious with terrace that had a small rack to hang dry clothes (great for after the beach!). Good spread for breakfast, there were fruits, cereal, bread, cheeses, ham, pastries and Salvo made us coffee. We tried fresh figs from the garden and Salvo\u2019s mother makes delicious cannolis! Thank you for your welcoming hospitality!","36404":"Ideally located for a short break in Syracuse, right in the centre of Ortygia. Very friendly owner and very nice breakfast. Our room was very clean,modern and comfortable and had a view over the Piazza. Breakfast is served quite late so could be a problem if you need to get away early in the morning.","36418":"We had a great 5 night stay here. Brilliantly located on Ortigia and managed by the impressively busy and linguistically gifted Floriana, a friendly and helpful host.\nGood clean rooms right where you would want to be.","36421":"We spend 2 days in Syracuse and we stayed in this B&B in May 2015. It is well-located, just at Piazza Archimede at the end of Corso Giacomo Matteotti, in a walking distance from the Duomo and from the core of old Ortigia. In old town, there are a lot of restaurants where you can go. The B&B is well-maintained, clean, well-decorated, the breakfast is not abundant but good. The size of the rooms is variable. We were in 4 people and we had to take 2 rooms. Mine was very small and we could barely walk in the room or store our luggage; Checking the pictures of the site, I think it was the \u201cMatrimoniale\u201d. The other room was larger and accommodated two people without problem, I think 3 adults would not be a good idea; this one was the \u201cMatrimoniale +1\u201d.\nWell, unfortunately, there were also other downside. We were by car, and as it usually happens in any Italian city, Siracusa is a difficult town to drive in, if you\u2019re not a local. Old town districts usually are forbidden to outsiders and we knew it. We told the owner about our worries and she said there would be no problem. Then, it happened two facts that affected us. We get to the B&B about 5-6 PM \u2013 the time we advised we would get there. However, there was nobody to receive us. As we didn\u2019t have any cellphone to call , it was hard to reach the owner. We parked the car besides the piazza and waited, afraid of a ticket. I finally found a public telephone that worked and could talk to her. She didn\u2019t take long to come, though (I think about 10 minutes), but since we arrived we stayed there for almost one hour. As she get there, her boyfriend went to talk to the policemen and we thought there would be no ticket after all. However, after 4 months of returning home, I got a ticket by post! My Italian is not that good, but I could understand we did something wrong on Corso Giacomo Matteotti (the main Ortigia\u2019s street, which brings you to the Piazza Archimede): we parked in a forbidden place or we drove along it. The problem is that we drove the car through the area just two times, either arriving and leaving. So, yes, there is a problem if you come by car.","36422":"In the charming Piazza Archimede, this room overlooks the fountains and offers a great views. Il Duomo, Via Cavour and shopping areas are real close, amazing location in this charming town. The hostess gave us many tips on the city, breakfast was fantastic... Only thing to remember is that parking lot is far off, better to drop bags and then park... Enjoy the beautiful city of Siracusa...","36438":"We followed signs to talete parking and parked there in an undercover car park, was reasonable price (10 euros for 24 hours I think). Was about a 10 minute walk to archimede vacanze, but easy to find. Don't know if there is any easier parking nearby.\n\nGot there and spent about 10 mins ringing the bell at reception. Rang them to find they'd left the key with a friend at the museum on the square. So be prepared for this, if no one is there don't waste time like us and just ring them :-)\n\nRoom was a good size with nice view of the square and fountain. Everything is within walking distance, even walking into Siracusa. The room is noisy at night, but that should probably be expected given Its location.\n\nBreakfast was decent, a small help yourself buffet.\n\nStaff were friendly, but left us to ourself, which we liked :-)","36485":"Hidden away in a small courtyard but ideally located in the very center of Ortigia this small B&B offers everything one needs for a short stay in Siracusa. The rooms are large, quiet, and airy, they have been recently renovated (actually we got a bigger room than that originally booked as \"our\" room was just being painted). The B&B is located just around the corner from the cathedral with restaurants, bars, and shops in the vicinity (the main shopping street is around the next corner) in a very picturesque street full of plants and flowers.\nWarning. If you arrive by car don't try to drive to the B&B - only Sicilians can make it there and even they are not allowed to park - head directly for the Talete parking and leave your car there. It is a bit of walk but you are certain to find a parking place there. Set your GPS to walking mode or it will lead you in circles, Ortigia consist of one-way streets only.","36548":"Very poor presentation, depressing dark and small room, awful bathroom, unclean and shabby, (see photo of highly attractive bathroom radiator), poor breakfast, awful coffee, breakfast room uninspiring, bedroom door not fitting, walls thin....... shall I go on?! Only plus is its proximity to Ortigia which is gorgeous. Ho hum. :thumbsdown:????","36563":"We were staying as part of The Spotlight on Sicily tour. Some of our group had a better room but ours was shocking. The only way to open cases was to put them on the bed. Mould and dust everywhere. I am not sure how it managed to get the four star rating. I gave it 2.5 stars. 1 star for electricity, 1 star for water and half a star for toilet paper.","36584":"Hotel location not to far to center of Ortigia. But from hotel to far point of ortigia is around 2.5 km. This is not big problem. It is walkable distance. Inside of hotel is very old. Every thing inside needs renawal. It shouldnt be this much money. Breakfast also poor. We always drunk the tea with cold water due to old thermoses. Hotel has private free parking. This is very good. If I come to Sirakuza again, I don\u2019t stay here.","36590":"By old I mean the room is in desperate need of a make-over. Pretty much everything thing seems to be from the time the hotel was built. Moldy, unhinged shower doors, asthmatic AC, old and inoperable TV, it all adds up to a room you don't want to be in. But it beats sleeping on a park bench, if you'd have to choose. Parking space is very limited, so best not to count on it too much, although personally I was able to park.\nBreakfast was okay-ish; the usual cereal and watery juices, an assortment of sweets and buns, and some cheese, ham and salami. Please stay away from the 'american' coffee; if you thought an americano was an insult to Italian coffee this will gut punch it. Instead just order espresso or cappuccino, they'll happily bring you some.\nNow the best part of the hotel is the location, just a few minutes away on foot is the historical part of the city, which offers plenty to see, do, eat and drink. Also the staff seemed nice.","36592":"I stayed here on a business trip. This hotel was quite old fashioned and dated and not much room in the bedroom. Big enough bathroom.\n\nThe bathroom shower door was broken and a little grubby. Overall the room was fine for a sleep and go out type of accommodation.\n\nIt was a little difficult to park at times, it states that there is parking however the whole time were there there was no parking for us to use even though we contacted the hotel before hand to ask to reserve.\n\nYou can park in certain spaces outside and round the back but finding a space in high season isn\u2019t easy.\n\nThe staff were nice enough. The hotel included breakfast which was typical traditional continental. They offered a dinner but I recommend eating out. If you walk 15 minutes you can over the bridge into Ortigia where there are plenty of places to eat and drink.\nOverall I would recommend to people who don\u2019t want to stay in their room and want to get out, it\u2019s a good base as its close enough to Catania airport.\n\nThis hotel wheelchair friendly, it has a wheelchair lift and also lifts inside.","36594":"the rooms are still with quite old furniture and still wall-to-wall carpets. the bathroom is also very old and the shower in te tub did not work at all.\nthe breakfast is not very selective, there is no real italian bread available and coffee is served in plastic cups.the servants are not very friendly too.\nthe positive side of the coin is the parking lot and the location, very close to the old town.","36601":"We stayed here with a group. Our check in was quick and courteous. The lifts are small and each can accommodate only three people at a time. Our room was on the fifth floor, clean and with adequate space. There was only one chair in a double room; unfortunately a widespread practise. The bathroom was also clean, spacious and well equipped. Bedding was of cotton it seemed, for it did not induce sweating. A huge plus point in my book. Traffic noise cannot be avoided, Siracusa is a busy place. However the air conditioning was quiet and adequate, allowing one to sleep with the window closed. Breakfast earned only two stars. The orange juice was insipid. On an island bursting with orange trees it should be possible to provide superior orange juice. There were four cereal dispensers, each containing the same cereal .... no choice. There was no fresh fruit, only the tinned variety. The hotel breakfast was a disappointing start to the day.\nIn summary, a reasonable city hotel spoiled by a lacklustre breakfast.","36630":"Loved the modern decor and fixtures, breakfast was simple but fresh, fantastic large shower, very clean and great staff, right on the water,but......\nHotel is located right next to main road which can get a noisey.","36641":"We arrived from Catania airport (about one hour drive), a bit exhausted by a long journey (two flights plus the drive) and were very nicely welcomed. We had carefully selected our room and were not disappointed: it was truly on the beach! Only two rooms offer this, the others (four?) being quite close.\nThis being a very small property, we depended very much on one lady who did her utmost for us to have everything we needed, from finding nice places to have dinner to ordering food for our lunches (there is no restaurant at the Calapetra).\nAll together we had a very relaxing mini-break and would love to go back soon...","36642":"Everything was perfect!\nA so confortable hotel near the beach:heart_eyes::heart_eyes::beach_umbrella::beach_umbrella: with everything we want for holidays.\nThe room with a nice terrace full of beautiful flowers! A nice bathroom with a perfect shower!\nAll the staff were so so nice ! Speechless:blush:\nNext year I wiil be there again:grin::grin:","36643":"This hotel consists of six unique rooms managed by a small but amazingly helpful and friendly group of staff members. From breakfast to the beach service provided to accommodate the guests in the beach (which is currently public, but is currently being requested by the resort to privatise a section for the hotel only). The hotel is open from April to October each year, as Siracusa's weather does allow for a wide beach season boasting up to 25-30 degrees (Celsius) in the first weeks of October (as experienced by us). Taking into account the previous reviews regarding overcrowding in the beaches in June-August especially on weekends is a definite issue but as the garden is private and right by the sea (with direct access), it is understood that laying in the garden between bathing is the best approach. However, October has no such problems and the beach remains comfortably empty throughout the week and relatively little noise. The water is also crystal clear and has a very large bathing area, as it is a bay, within the bounds of sand bottom (as opposed to the algae bottom appearing around 60 metres into the sea, reaching depths of around 2.5-3 m). This bay also provides wind shelter and this is reflected in the waves, which are almost non existent.\n\nHaving booked two rooms together and an impromptu extension, I was offered a simple room switch which allowed me to experience three of the six rooms (room 2, 3 and 4). All these rooms were beautifully designed, albeit some privacy issues in Room 2 (Superior) as there is no door to separate the bathroom from the bedroom. This is unlikely to be a problem if only used between couples but family rooms become cumbersome. The couple rooms are the ones in fact with bathroom doors, whilst the family rooms do not have one. Nonetheless, if required, some curtains can be requested and added to the door to eliminate this problem.\n\nThe breakfast served, keeping in mind the size of the hotel, is very good, and served with attention to detail and comfort. It is served outdoors on the garden under a wooden and glass panel structure which sits beautifully overlooking the beach. Rooms with a garden view possess direct access to the breakfast area. Glass panels will be added to the structure in the future for days with excessive wind or rain (which, I stress, are very rare, although a possibility in October). A plan to split between sightseeing and bathing can help to optimise days with less sun or weather events if staying very late or very early in the season (and there are so many things to see nearby).\n\nAccess to lunch or dinner service, especially in October is certainly limited without a car, however, Cassibile, the nearest town, has everything you may need. A trip to Noto, Ortigia or Syracuse for dinner is also a great solution.\n\nIn conclusion, I would recommend visiting this place, or returning if you have been here in 2016 as there have been many changes, and it is well worth it. A big thank you to all staff members involved between 7-13th October 2017.","36683":"I'd you're looking for character and charm then this is the place for you. An ex bank converted into a family home after WW1. Turned into a hotel 30 years ago. If you're looking for a dust free environment then this is not for you. If you're an old romantic then give this hotel a go.","36688":"Staffed by people who could not be faulted for their willingness to help but let down by an old and tired \"feel\". Our initial thoughts were that we had wandered into \"Fawlty Towers\" and gave serious thought to finding other accomodation but a room change and the friendliness and the warmth of the gentleman at reception put paid to that. The hotel is extremely well situated on Ortigia Island but needs a massive cash injection to enable it to do justice to the building and its surrounds.","36693":"This hotel should be closed.\nWe arrived after booking for 3 nights and paying in advance.\nWe went to see our room which had a wonky bed with stains on the bedspread.\nThe room had the look and smell of a cheap, unclean place.\nThe woman at the desk showed us to another room, which was bigger but the same awful wonky bed with a bathroom door that would only half open to the end of the bed.\nWe left and found another hotel, after been told that there wouldn't be a refund.\nThis is a place my dog wouldn't sleep on.\nIt's dirty, musty, badly maintained and should be avoided at all cost.","36694":"Travelling with friends (on a budget), we chose Palazzo Giarac\u00e1 based on TripAdvisor reviews and it didn't disappoint.\nThe classic hotel building is well located just over Punto Umbertino and our rooms had a good view out on to the bay. The place is a little quirky and dated but it only adds to the charm Our host (Bruno) looked after us superbly.\nNOTE; traffic on Ortigia is crazy, so if you are driving I suggest you spend the few euro to make use the hotel's off-street parking.","36698":"place in the very center. best to start visiting.\nvery friendly service\nbut room cleaning is very poor and a lot to fix in the bathroom.\nwalls are thin, so you can hear the neighbor wispering. which is rather interesting, especially if they are playing love games","36702":"We had a family room for 4 + a baby. We slept on a pull-out bed, which was very unconfortable. The shower was falling apart. We had a small kitchen area but it did not have anything besides the stove, fosset and fridge (not a single pot, piece of silverware, plate or cup). The parking was super tiny we could hardly get in. Nobody spoke a word of English.\n\nBesides that, the location was good and the old building impressive","36714":"Nice Palazzo hotel, with friendly owner and good location.\nBut unfortunatly the hotel needs an update. A big one. Breakfast was always empty and every day the same. Plastic garden chairs to sit on. The rooms have a good size but the curtains need a wash. The bathroom, leakage here and there. The mattresses are as old as the palazzo is. The overall interior needs a big update. Price, you pay too much for what it is worth.","36721":"On the island Ortyga is this beautiful old building, with high ceilings and beautiful tiles on the floor. The staff is very helpful and speaks good English. Parking is in a garage 5 minutes walking. Breakfast is Italian, so the coffee is great.","36774":"We really enjoyed the time being at this b&b and will definitely come back! Breakfast on an open terrace, with its own kitchenette. The rooms were super clean and there were very nice people!! Thank you Sabrina for everything!! :)","36786":"We had great email communication with Sabrina and Antonella before we left and a warm welcome when we arrived, everyone was very friendly and helpful. The location was very peaceful and only 5 mins drive to several beaches in Fontane Bianche. The accommodation was very nice, spacious and clean with good AC. We had a fabulous holiday. we will be back again.","36914":"We stayed at B&B L'infiorescenza and our experience there was AMAZING!! the room were very clean and beautiful, the service was impeccable.... The B&B is located in the city and accessible to everything. The staff was very helpful in educating us about the beautiful attractions near by. The food was exquisite and authentically Italian.","37019":"Do not even think of coming to this so called hotel. Its a disaster. The only thing on the positive side is its location. Otherwise, room cleaning and bathroom are far cry from the hotel description. The receptionist is also very unhelpful as when we tried to ask her to solve a problem in the shower, she simply ignored our complaint. Not recommended at all!!","37064":"Since parking in Sicily is difficult to find, this hotel, right on the waterfront, was a bonus with ample parking right in front of the hotel. We found the location was excellent since we could walk into Ortigia and although walking at night might seem sketchy, we didn't feel unsafe. The mattresses could have been better but the rooms were clean. The continental breakfast could have had more choices but the staff made us special coffees with no complaint while we waited out the rain. They even inquired about the wellbeing of my husband after I mentioned he was not feeling well. We did not eat dinner here but friends had an excellent meal. They have a large roof top terrace for dining, a seaside patio and an internal patio area for guests. I would recommend this hotel to people that aren't concerned about the contents of the mini bar.","37070":"Myself and my partner had our first holiday in Sicily. We had a wondrful time, loads to see and do.\nThe hotel is pleasent, clean and tidy. Our room was basic, but comfortable. I was a little disappointed the pictures didn't match reality. There wasn't a mention of the roof terrace and not all facilities seemed to be available. However, the staff are amazing, super helpful and will do everything they can to make your stay wonderful.\nI will say, it would be helpful if the hours of check in at reception are noted on the website. We were not notified reception was so limited and last check in was at 7pm. Also, the contact details on Loveholidays is incorrect. This needs to be updated. Our stay was reduced to 3 nights as had to pay extra for another hotel due to reception being closed when we arrived. Make sure you get flights which allow for the check in times at the hotel. Other than this, we had a wonderful holiday and are looking to come back next year.","37075":"Very nice hotel on the promenade next to see, with view of the see from some rooms ( we had ). It is very old style, it has its unique atmosphere. Good for families with kids. Mid range, so also is quality, but grt value of money. B&B concept could be extended, breakfast were nice. Ortigia is must see, we loved the place!","37076":"Extremely friendly staff, I really enjoyed being there as it is a unique one, i would like to give my opinion regarding the food good taste and quality, we spent 5 days and we would love to come back at our next vacation. Thank you everyone one for making our vacation awesome ;)","37089":"Residence is in historic centre of Siracusa. We had an appartement for 3 personnes with 2 bedrooms, small living room and kitchen corner. It was clean, spacious... juste the bathroom was unkept, it\u00b4s need the renovation. Kitchen is not good equipped. No cleaning during all the week. It\u00b4s good for 1-3 nights. There is not a beach nearby. So it\u00b4s just for visiting city. The breakfast starts late. Normally at 8:30a.m., sometimes at 9 a.m. Better to prepare something yourself.","37164":"We stayed 3 night in Le Saline during July, and it was perfect. Close to everything in a quiet dead end street so not noisy at all but you can reach anything in a few minutes by car. The owner, Stefano was great, very friendly, speaks English very well, provides an exceptionally high level of service and hospitality. He knows his city well and gave us lots of helpful information about Syracuse, restaurant recommendations and tips.He made sure that we had everything we needed. Our room was very nice and clean with a huge balcony. Breakfast was amazing. Every morning different kind of fantastic toast and sweets, fresh orange juice...simple excellent.We had the perfect stay at B&B Le Saline and we highly recommend to anybody!","37166":"I stayed for just two nights, but that was not long enough! From the moment of my arrival at B & B Saline I was treated like family. The close proximity to Ortigia, but away from the hustle and bustle of the city made it ideal for me. Such a relaxing time with and INCREDIBLE breakfast. Bravo Stefano and family for making me feel so welcome.\nHope to visit next time I am in Siricusa! Tu amico, Danny","37167":"Just spent 3 nights at this lovely B & B. Perfect for discovering Siracusa and the surrounding area.\nLovely rooms and the breakfast is amazing. All made by the great host Stefano who is a very informative and attentive host. We will be sure to recommend and if we ever get back to Siracusa it\u2019s where we will be staying.\nThankyou Stefano we had a great stay :thumbsup:","37171":"Our suite was up three flights of stairs. After being out in the heat all day we were hoping to come home to some air conditioning. The fan worked but there was very little if any cool air coming out of the air conditioning unit. After a cool shower we were damp with sweat 10 minutes later. We brought it to the attention of the front desk the first few days then realized we weren't going to get any cooler. Noticed only americans and Brits complaining, tho. There is now a $10 breakfast fee.","37172":"Good location, safe, clean modern, comfortable. Staff was not particularly helpful\/ fluent in English. Warning breakfast is actually at a small cafe up the block. The options were extremely limited and the staff disinterested.. your better option is to find your own breakfast. There is a small grocery down the block with has all you need. Very close to everything. Would particularly recommend Cortile Verga for a pre dinner or after dinner stop. Great staff, fun cocktail menu.","37173":"We enjoyed our stay at Lemoni- it is right in the heart of Ortigia, and an easy walk to local markets, Duomo and waterfront areas. We also walked to the Parco Archaeologica one day, which took about 30 minutes.","37175":"We stayed for 2 nights in a family room in this very good B & B. Our room was on the ground floor with access to a small courtyard. It was a big room for 2 people, the bathroom was a little bit small. The location is in a small very quiet street in the middle of the town and really perfect. The breakfast is next-door and was really Italian with good coffee and everything you need.","37178":"Overall, I think this is a very comfortable B&B and is in great location. Location is right near the Piazza Archimedes, really close to everything in Ortigya.\nThe room was on the 2nd floor, very comfortable bed, nicely decorated, just the right size. Clean.\n\nBreakfast was the best we had in Italy!\n\nThe reason for 4 stars is because we had two specific situations that we encountered. Two rooms didn't have hot water for a 1.5 days, but because the front desk is not staffed all the time, we could not get the hot water turned back until the next day. Not a big deal, but it was inconvenient.\n\nThe other thing was when we first arrived, there was no one there to open the door, so we were knocking on the front door for about 10 minutes. Finally the host came, so it was not a disaster, but we could not get in touch with the host earlier. I suggest figuring out your exact arrival time and making sure to communicate with the host in advance.\n\nOther than that I though the place was fine for a short stay.","37179":"We spent 3 perfect nights in the Junior Suite with Terrace. The staff was very helpful and accommodating. The breakfast buffet was extensive and delicious. The room and bed were very comfortable and the location was perfect- centrally located in the old city and walkable to the train station and ancient ruins. Our stay surpassed our expectations and we hope to have a chance to stay again soon!","37180":"We spent two nights in a family room with our two kids.\nThe room was spacious, nicely decorated and clean.\nThe service was impeccable and the staff very friendly.\nThe only issue would be that we could hear noise from the inside of the hotel and outside too.\nHowever I highly recommend this charming B&B.","37181":"This place is located down an adorable street right near the center of Ortigya. The room was spotless, surprisingly modern, and perfect for our family of four. It had a queen bed and twin bunk beds, which my kids loved. The owner was wonderful and happy to answer any questions and give us restaurant recommendations. All the hotel staff were super sweet to my boys.\n\nThe most impressive part of this B&B was the breakfast! OMG - there were eggs, bacon, tons of fruits, yogurt, and the most delicious different pastries, cakes, and cookies - different each morning. My 7 year-old's first breakfast included 3 pieces of chocolate cake. I enjoyed a baked pastry with cheese and roasted tomato, along with a cannoli filled with pistacio cream - Ah-mazing!","37182":"We stayed 4 nights at the end of May. We had one of the lower level rooms which was very large, however, there was not much daylight. The lighting provided by the hotel was excellent though. The beds were way too hard, but that seems typical almost everywhere in Europe. The location was good, about a 10 minute walk from the parking lot. The breakfast was huge. Be sure to taste the pastry that is shaped like a bagel and stuffed with figs. It was amazing. It was very clean and quiet. However our friends were on the 1st floor facing the street and they said it was very noisy. Early morning trash pick up and late night revelers really disrupted their sleep.The hotel arranged a private ride to the airport for less than it would have cost if we booked it ourselves. The staff was excellent, attentive and helpful.","37186":"The reasons we loved Lemoni Suites: 1) It is extremely well-located in Ortygia, on a relatively quiet side street, within an easy walk of all the major sights. 2) The best breakfast we ever had in Sicily 3) Immaculately clean thought 4) Welcoming, knowledgable host and hostess 5) Comfortable beds and clean linens 6) Attractive and chic decor. One note here: the rooms vary quite a bit in size. I was in one of the smaller rooms by myself and totally comfortable. If you are a couple, you might opt for one of the larger rooms.","37188":"We visited Oritigia for five nights and stayed at the Lemoni suites. From our arrival Marcello and his staff made us feel extremely welcome and were always available to help. The breakfast was amazing. A perfect start to each day's exploring. The rooms are bright and airy. The location is ideal to explore the Island. We recommend wandering tge local streets to find great bars and eateries. A wonderful stay and we will definitely be going back.","37189":"My mother and I had a wonderful three-night stay at the Lemoni Suites. We did not book breakfast, so cannot comment on that. Here are the reasons you should book this property and why I would stay again:\n-Ideal location in the middle of Ortygia. We walked to everything but the Archeology Park.\n-Well organized. Marcello was there to greet us and check us in and gave us the door code so we could come and go as we pleased.\n-Very tasteful minimalist design and large rooms.\n-Very clean, Your room is also cleaned daily if you so desire.\n-Good sleep- rooms are quiet and have good shades and very high-quality bed linens.\n-Strong water pressure and enough hot water; high-quality bath sheets.\n-Strong wifi\n-Thoughtful touches like hot water boiler, safe, clothes drying rack, umbrellas to lend, etc.\n\nA few things to note:\n-There is no lift. There are rooms on the first and ground floors though. We had a room on the first floor and it was great. The ground floor rooms are near the breakfast room, which could be an issue if you are not an early riser.\n-Beds are firm. I prefer firm beds, so this was a plus for me.\n-This is a B&B and not a hotel, so make sure you are not expecting facilities amenities (like a gym or lounge) or 24-hour reception.","37192":"A 5 Star B&B:star2::star2::star2::star2: :star2:\n\nWhat makes B&B Lemoni Suites so outstanding are the hosts Marcelo & Milagros.\n\nTheir constant attention to details and personal involvement are focused on only one thing, making our stay special and memorable!\n\nMarcelo is so experienced and resourceful, and knows immediately what you need!\n\nWe will definitely go back, and if anyone is looking for a special time in Siracusa, this is the place to be - You will not be disappointed !","37193":"Well situated on Ortigia Island close to Archimedes Square. So be prepared to use the public car park at \u20ac10 per day.\nBest breakfast we had in Sicily! Well equipped bedroom. Owner's restaurant recommendations were spot-on.\nOnly downside was no help was offered with baggage up the stairs.","37194":"This hote is a gem in the center of Ortygia. If driving a bit of a challenge to get to by car but parking is available at the public parking garage near the harbor. A beautiful boutique hotel with a very gracious host. Located near Piazza Archimede and within walking distance of many of the sights in Ortygia. If I ever travel back to Siracusa I will stay at the Lemoni Suites","37197":"As a retired exec for a luxury hotel group, I don\u2019t usually gush ... this is a rare exception. Marcello has done an outstanding job at designing and managing a fine (five star) B&B. From booking to departure, he and his team go above and beyond...\nA beautiful Inn in a beautiful city!","37198":"Push the button on the intercom and enter the clean, bright world of Lemoni Suites. A friendly and informative greeting, which included some useful tips and a handy map. A simple and efficient check-in and you're directed to your room. My key came complete with a knitted lemon keyring, full marks for attention to detail and humour. My room was, fresh bright and clean, along with the essential aircon (yes, even in October!). Kettle and coffee machine in the room were useful and often missing in European hotels. Breakfast was an ample buffet, plenty of choice and a briefing on the coffee machine, if required. So if you want a clean hotel in a great area, with friendly staff, look no further.","37200":"We loved this quaint little hotel. The room was bright and modern with great Wifi and fantastic breakfast. Located on a small street close to lots of things in Siracusa. The staff is friendly and helpful. We would definitely stay here again.","37202":"A couple of practical issues first. Lemoni Suites is in the heart of the old centre of Ortigia, so there is no car parking nearby - the nearest car park is 10 minutes walk away. (Obviously this problem applies to all other hotels on Ortigia as well.) If you're happy navigating the (narrow) back streets, you can stop outside the hotel to unload your luggage - but no more than that, since you will be blocking the street. You also need to be aware that this is a small hotel (fewer than 10 rooms?), so reception is not staffed all day. If you arrive before the official 4pm check-in time, you will not be able to get in - unless you've made prior arrangements with the hotel. It is also an old building, so there is no lift\/elevator, though staff were happy to help with our luggage (and there are a couple of ground floor rooms if you really can't manage the stairs).\n\nOnce you're actually in, the hotel is bright (modern decor in whites and yellows) and fresh, with a scent of lemon (a little too strong in our room, but they were happy to tone it down) throughout. Our room (a Junior Suite) was possibly the best. It was large, bright, and comfortable. I try to choose our hotels based firstly on the quality of their beds - after all, most of your time in a hotel is spent sleeping! Lemoni did not disappoint - our bed was large and comfortable, with luxurious linens, and we slept like kings. Breakfast was fine - a good selection of hot & cold, sweet & savoury (with some unusual spreads, like pistacchio cream - my wife went searching the local shops so she could bring some home!).\n\nStaff, including the manager (owner?) were very friendly and helpful. This will certainly be our first choice next time we're lucky enough to visit Siracusa. And the icing on the cake - the best restaurant in town, Don Camillo, is just around the corner.","37203":"This is a hotel you dream of finding! Perfect host and team, great rooms, incredible central but quiet location in the heart of one of the world's most beautiful and historic cities. Combine that with an unbelievable breakfast and you could want for nothing more. One of the best hotels we have ever stayed in. And Siracusa is a dream, a complete history of Europe encapsulated in one city. A place to keep returning to.","37204":"We stayed two nights at this B&B. The location is great. The room was extremely clean. The bed was comfortable and the room was quiet (it's on a pedestrian only street). The breakfast was amazing with homemade cakes, meats, cheese, and even eggs. The owner was always making sure everything was okay with our stay. We were able to leave our bags on the last day. We were on the top floor so there were a lot of stairs but that wasn't a problem for us. Definitely recommended!","37205":"Stayed two nights in this beautiful town, at this lovely B and B, in a charming quiet street in the old town. Marcelo the owner is charming and very helpful , the room was spotless and good choice for breakfast .","37216":"What an amazing place to stay!!!!\nThe quality of service and amenities of this little family run b&b should be what every accomodation seller should try to achieve. Every little detail has been thought about and taken care of. Can't get better in terms of comfort, service and price. We didn't want to leave.\nWonderful!!!! \u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606","37218":"The best value for money you will find in Ortigia!\nBreakfast is great, the room is comfortable and neat!!\nAll you can ask for at a reasonable price with a very helpful host.\nI highly recommend the room on the second floor to anyone visiting this lovely city.\n(Chitra)","37220":"Convenient, quaint, clean, good service and great breakfasts. Nearby is the \"hop on hop off\" tour bus for $5 Euro all day and it will get you to all the sights. If you want the experience of living in the village with cobblestone streets this is it. Many good restaurants nearby. If you drive there know that you must unload your luggage quickly and then park the car. The streets are narrow, any car behind you must wait. But, that is all part of the charm.","37221":"Lemoni suites is gorgeous, the rooms are beautifully designed, clean and very comfy beds, the breakfast is to die for, so delicious and Marcelo is the best host i have ever had he is extremely attentive and helps make your time in Syracuse the best it can be. Will definitely be returning","37222":"Tucked away in a hard-to-find but charming part of Ortigia (the oldest part of Syracuse), this hotel is a gem. Marcello, the owner, and his staff make guests feel like family. The rooms are pleasant, efficiently decorated and immaculate. The breakfasts (included) are outstanding. The only downside: finding the hotel and then finding parking. But it is worth the slight bother. We will be back.","37223":"Where to start with this little gem of a find in the beautiful town of Siracusa? Your host Marcelo and his excellent team are welcoming you in to their home. 5 Star touches everywhere indicate vast experience in the hospitality industry at the top level. Impeccably clean, with a freshly prepared, bespoke breakfast every morning that will live life long in my memory (until we return). As a Chef myself I fully appreciate the time, effort and passion it takes to source great local ingredients and deliver them to such a high standard. The French toast is to die for! Marcelo is on hand 24\/7 to assist with any query and is quite clearly very passionate about making your experience a memorable one. Congratulations Marcelo and team on a fantastic product.","37225":"Where do you start with this amazing place. We are a couple of Aussies doing a tour around Southern Italy and Sicily.\n\nLocation is perfect. It is so central to the beautiful Ortigia section of Syracuse and everything is within walking distance.\n\nMy wife contacted Lemoni just prior to arrival. We were provided with perfect maps to guide us through the town to the hotel to drop off our luggage. From there we had another map to take us to the parking that everyone uses in the area which is 10 Euro a night. The walk back was about 7mins.\n\nThe rooms are lovely. Now keeping in mind, as like in other Italian and Sicilian cities - space is at a premium. If you wanting a large apartment style room then think you in wrong city. What they have done here to maximise this space is fantastic. The whole area is bright and fresh. Our room was perfectly set out and one of the most comfortable beds you could ask for. Keeping in mind, the room is for sleep and showering, the rest of the time we wanted to be out visiting this beautiful place. There is also a common area upstairs. Though I do want to say, some people have complained (even while we are there) that the rooms and bathrooms are small and to that I say two things\n\n1. It is Ortigia - not the open plans of central Australia. Space is a premium\n2. I am 6 foot 4 and 100kg - the room was plenty big enough (and we had the smallest one)\n\nBreakfast was sensational with a wide spread of typical Euro style breakfasts in the downstairs room.\n\nLastly, Marcello the host. A wonderful man who takes a great deal of pride in his operation and it is understandable why. On arrival he gave us excellent recommendations about all aspects of our stay. It is hard to fault anyone who is that passionate about his guests experience in Ortigia. I would actually say he cares more about your holiday and experience than you do ;)\n\nI would strongly recommend staying at Lemoni Suites and if we are back in Syracuse in the future would not consider anywhere else.\n\nKaren and Michael\nSydney Australia","37227":"This lovely B & B is well situated on a side street in Ortigia; the rooms are of varying size, clean, good air conditioning and excellent beds. The breakfast was the best we had anywhere in Sicily and it differed slightly on a daily basis; the quality was very high and the orange juice divine! Marcelo is a wonderful host and source of information on many topics. Highly recommend.","37228":"We stayed here for 6 nights in April, 2018. This is an excellent hotel. The rooms are clean and beautiful. The Manager is very helpful and friendly. The location is excellent. We will always remember this wonderful vacation. And the breakfast is delicious. I highly recommend this small and attractive hotel.","37236":"The hotel is perfectly located in the heart of Ortigia, the talete parking lot is 5 minutes walking away and it's safe to leave the car there. Inside, the renovation and the interior design are remarkably nice and the owner is resourceful, professional and warm.\nThe breakfast at the nearby cafe is pleasant, the beds are comfortable and loved the capsule coffee machine in the room.\nThe assortment at breakfast is not huge, but it's sufficient for a standard Italian breakfast (croissant, juice, cereals, yogurt...)","37238":"The receptionist, Manuela, was delightful. Very sweet and bubbly. She showed us to our rooms and went through her info list and instructions, but we failed to ask how to turn on the heat (it\u2019s been unseasonable cold in southern Italy\/Sicily). We were there only two nights, but getting the two rooms on the fourth floor warm was a challenge. My room (with the little terrace) finally warmed up by the second night. I was wishing the weather was better to enjoy the terrace \u2013 it was really beautiful at night. In the other room, the heat wouldn\u2019t stay on, so the second night she stayed with one of our friends on the second floor (a two room suite). The beds were very comfortable. The two rooms on the 4th floor have an open stairway for the last flight, FYI. Could be tricky in inclement weather, but the elevator door has a small roof so that would be an option. The breakfast room was exceptionally cold. We all wore coats and scarves to breakfast. The buffet was simple but good, and they make cappuccinos\/espresso\/Americano to order. The hotel has a great location near the Arthemusa fountain and the main shopping district \u2013 and just a short walk to the Piazza del Duomo. I was researching for a group tour later this year; I probably wouldn't take a group here, but for individual travel it would be great.","37241":"Stayed for 3 nights and would highly recommend this B&B. The communication prior to arrival was excellent with prompt responses on the day of check in to answer our queries. Lovely welcome and lots of really useful information provided at check in. We were also provided with a free drinks voucher which was a lovely extra touch. The room was clean and a good size and had everything we needed. The breakfast had a good selection and you are offered a coffee too. The location was perfect to be able to walk to the all of the local attractions and was about 15 minute walk to the bus station and 20 minute walk to the train station in Syracuse.","37245":"This beautifully appointed B&B is more like a very well run small boutique hotel. You can feel the quality as soon as you enter.\n\nThe location - right in the heart of the ancient quarter of this delightful historic island is second to none.\n\nThe bed was probably the most comfortable in our six weeks in Italy. The d\u00e9cor and furnishings are all top quality with a lovely mix of old and new.\n\nTwo couples traveling together, we had booked a two bedroom apartment without realising that it had only one bathroom although this had been communicated to us in our confirmation!\n\nWhen we arrived, Valeria very kindly reallocated us to separate rooms and we all thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The Executive Double Room has three sets of French doors opening to balconies overlooking the charming streetscape. It includes a separate room with a table and chairs and this was really useful.\n\nMake sure you follow the clear instructions provided about parking. Due to an overzealous policemen, it was not actually possible for us to wait in the nearby Piazzo Archimde as suggested. There is undercover parking at Parcheggio Talete for 10\u20ac per day. This is a flat walk about 700 metres away.\n\nThe term Palazzo in Italy refers to an architectural style rather than an actual palace where royalty lived. Many hotels and B&B\u2019s in Italy are called Palazzo because they occupy all or part of a palazzi built by a wealthy family during the Italian Renaissance in the 19th century.\n\nPalazzo Gilistro truly lives up to it\u2019s name.","37246":"Stayed for 2 nights in an extremely spacious triple room with access to a small balcony and terrace overlooking a bustling Sicilian street. The room was beautifully decorated and incorporated ancient features as well as modern. The location couldn't be better located just off the main square and a stone's throw from all the main attractions. The staff were excellent and breakfast was very nice. Would definitely be back.","37247":"We were lucky enough to stay here for 3 nights. What a wonderful place. Centrally located to all parts of the island, a fantastic place to start from! We Clean rooms, comfy bed and very welcoming friendly staff. Elisa, Valeria and Pauline were so welcoming and helpful in our planning and visit, with advice on local info of where to go and what to do, planning transfers and tours. Breakfasts were good with lots to choose from. Al Sud next door was a gem! Would not hesitate to recommend or stay again.","37252":"Solo traveler. 2 nights. Spacious room and bathroom. Excellent location, steps from all the restaurants, cafes and bars. My only issue is that the continental breakfast was a bit light. Otherwise, I highly recommend this place.","37253":"We stayed here for two nights, in a double room suite. Very clean, neat, and nicely decorated. The perfect location, which was my primary reason for booking it. nice breakfast, friendly staff, all in all, a really great place. Yes, on certain nights you can hear the street and the music etc, if you don't want that, then stay out of the busy areas. I would easily stay here again, it was a great find.","37258":"Very nice hotel in a superb location for visitors to Ortigia. The suite we stayed in was very spacious, and spotless. The aircon worked very well, and the beds were really comfortable. The shower was a bit small compared to the size of the rooms\u2014one of those European glass cubicle situations. The staff were friendly, and provided some local information when asked. They had provided very good advance information on the somewhat tricky parking situation in Ortigia.\n\nThe only minuses: a somewhat uninspiring breakfast buffet; and renovation work going on in the palazzo opposite, which meant a sort of boring view of scaffolding and the noise of workmen shouting somewhat early in the morning.","37259":"The hotel is in an excellent location, just 200 meters from piazza Duomo, lots of great restaurants and cafes nearby. Ortigia is a unique place to visit.\n\n+ Staff is helpful and friendly and we want to say special thanks to Marcello for expectionally friendly service.\n+ breakfast terrace: very nice and breakfast ok\n+ Rooms are ok: clean and nicely decorated.\n+ unique beaches in Ortigia (both public and private)\n\n- a construction site opposite our windows: a slightly disturbing noices in the mornings\n- a bit hard matresses.","37262":"We began our 2 week Sicily trip in Ortigia and couldn't have been happier at Palazzo Gilistro. It is within walking distance of everything literally right out the door\nand extremely close to the taxi drop off almost at the doorstep. Our bright airy room had a lovely view from the terrace the bed very very comfortable and the bathroom roomy with a big tiled shower. We explored every bit of Ortigia and took a day trip to the amazing Baroque town of Noto ashort drive away. The whole staff were warm and friendly and always informative answered all questions we had regarding restaurants and sights. If you have the chance to stay here don't pass it up...Palazzo Gilistro has it all.\nThank you again","37268":"It would be difficult to dislike anything at all about this cozy residence. It offers a newly-restored historic building, energetic professional hosts who aim to please, a generous and varied breakfast, a squeeky clean modern bathroom, tall ceilings, a balcony with views of a winding lane, and an absolutely perfect location with a quaint neighborhood feel. In the winter months breakfast is served at a tiny cafe downstairs that gives you the sense of a private hangout. The hosts arrange reservations and offer suggestions with care.","37270":"Palazzo Gilistro is located right next to Piazza Duomo, everything is within walking distance, a most lovely renovated building with very comfortable bedrooms and bathrooms. The owner is charming and provides all the necessary information concerning Ortigia and surroundings.The best thing though, is the generous breakfast on the terrace!we had a hard time resisting all the lovely fresh cakes and products on display!\nWarmly recommended!our only regret is that our stay was so short!","37271":"We arrived like drowned rats on the first day of rain since July and having failed to find the shuttle bus. The welcoming receptionist seemed to have all the time in the world to spend telling us what to visit, where to eat etc. and the other staff that we met were unfailingly friendly and helpful. Our room was large and comfortable, breakfasts were exceptionally good and we loved the buzz of the Via Cavour and being able to eat well so near to our base. We also enjoyed cocktails and supper at the Cafe al Sud next door. One little gripe: maybe a no smoking policy on the breakfast terrace?","37272":"Our group of 12 stayed here for the final 3 nights of our Sicilian adventure. The property couldn't be more centrally-located. Fortunately, nighttime noise was not a problem despite being located in an area with decent nightlife. The rooms were spacious, clean, and charming. Our guests particularly enjoyed breakfast on the 3rd floor terrace, complete with made-to-order eggs (what can I say, Americans love their eggs for breakfast!). Highly recommend staying here.","37273":"The staff Pauline, Manuela and Elisabetta made this place truly fantastic. I travelled here with my parents and we felt so welcome and looked after by these three great hotel professionals. Thank you and bravi!","37274":"Loved Ortigia with its tiny, busy and colourful cobblestoned alleyways, and Palazzo Gilistro is right in the heart of it! We caught \u201cthe little grey bus\u201d from the bus station to Piazza Archimede and had no trouble finding the property. Loved our room - small balconies on both sides and a separate bathroom (separated by a hallway). The noise from the streets below at night was a bit of a problem (doors\/shutters not completely sound-proof), but some ear plugs fixed that! Three of our four days in Siracusa were marred by torrential rain (the view of the streets below was more akin to Venice) and breakfast had to be served in the cafe\/bar next door rather than the terrace, which was disappointing, but we nevertheless loved our stay on the island in this lovely B&B. Super friendly and helpful staff always leaves a good impression!","37275":"When we arrived Elizabeth could not help us enough. She was so welcoming and explained all the sites and told us which restaurants to go to. When checking out Manuela was the same. The hotel is charming and a great location. You can walk to everything and the fountain next to it is lovely. The breakfast was good with eggs being cooked to order.","37276":"The hotel is connected to Sicily with two bridges to the east of the island. Ortiga is a good choice to stay with nice restaurants, streets and beach walking paths. The room we stayed in had two semi-bedrooms and was quite spacious with the bathroom. The breakfast in the morning is hearty and very successful compared to international breakfasts. Sweet products predominantly at breakfast olive and cheese taste suitable for your taste. The hotel, which was successful in cleaning, looked at the inner courtyard, but in a geographical area where all the streets are narrow, this does not matter. Reception staff were helpful at all times during booking and as long as we stayed at the hotel. Parking is not a problem on the island, you can leave your car in the park by paying 10 euros per day. There are beaches close to the Ortiga but we do not have any idea about the subject when we can not get to the sea from the sightseeing. Fast, a bit complicated, but in our opinion, be sure to get familiar with traffic flowing in the shortest time to rule, etna, cefalu, ragusa, modica and note. I did not mention how you would see Palermo and Katanay. If you have a desire to explore the whole of the island, you can split your accommodation preference into two as east and west. The roads are two-lane highway, but it can be tiring to come and go during the day.","37279":"Palazzo Gilistro has very helpful and kind staff. They are like a tourist guide, you can learn everything about this small island from them. Thanks Elisabetta for her suggestions. It is in the middle of this island, and the location is perfect. You can walk everywhere very easily. The room is very big and decorated stylishly. It was also so clean.","37318":"The Palazzo Gilistro is a small hotel smack bang on one of the busiest junctions in Ortigia, but it's an oasis inside. Despite being in an old building, it's been brought up to date with a clean and contemporary makeover. The public areas are all tile and marble, keeping it cool inside on the hottest of Sicilian days.\nWe had the large room at the top of the building, the balcony had a small table and chairs. We'd end each evening with a glass of wine or more, overlooking the sea and watching the people in the busy Via Cavour below. You can purchase excellent local wine in reception for a reasonable price.\nThe room itself was large enough with a king size bed, comfortable mattress and plenty of pillows. The tiles on the floor here kept the room clan, as did the efficient and quiet air con. The bathroom was contemporary, with a large rain shower and plenty of space.\nStorage in the room was a bit limited, just the one wardrobe, but this seems to be a recurring theme all over Italy. There is a fridge in the room with soft drinks etc. We just used it to keep bottles of water chilled.\nWhat really makes this the place to stay however is the staff, they were absolutely lovely. Polite, friendly and oh so helpful. There aren't facilities to make coffee in the room (just tea), but they'd make us coffee on the breakfast terrace to take to our room. They also left us a bottle of wine one day and booked restaurants and taxis for us at short notice.\nOne last thing to add, a simple breakfast is available on the terrace, including eggs cooked in your own way. The terrace itself is small, and there are a lot of tables around. Watch out if you're clumsy like me, it's like working your way around a house of cards sometimes!","37323":"Our family of 4 stayed in a duplex suite and from minute one the staff could not do enough for us. The pool area is excellent, and the poolside bar and cafe offers a great range of drinks and cocktails as well as a good range of lunchtime food - although the burgers are huge and proved even too much for our teenage sons! Luisa was so helpful in suggesting and arranging other places to visit and eat and all the staff made us feel very welcome. The rooms were very clean and air conditioning was at the perfect temperature, which hasn\u2019t been the case in some of the hotels we have stayed at on our trip. From all the hotels we have stayed at so far in Sicily this is the one which our family has loved the most. Highly recommended","37334":"Lovely hotel. Beautiful grounds. Rooms were small but nice. The only weird part was the location which feels like driving through the slums to get to. Breakfast was beautifully presented - found it strange that it cost more to order eggs. We had a car which made it easy to get to but found we drove to syracuse (about 10 mins) each day to get dinner.","37340":"Everything here is charming and no detail too much! I enjoyed two nights while visiting Siracusa and I will definitely return! Mari and the staff were all true gems when it comes to customer service. You will need a rental car as previous reviews stated but the peace and quiet at the hotel made for a truly relaxing experience. The breakfast was absolutely delicious - a great variety and spread. I enjoyed a dinner at Hibiscus and it was wonderful, they served an amuse bouche - the service was impeccable. The grounds are meticulously maintained and the pool(s) are refreshing.","37343":"There is nothing other than praise for this hotel!\nThe staff are the most friendly helpful people one could find.\nThe rooms are spacious and well appointed.\nThe pools are amazing and the gardens well kept and interesting.\nThe chef is first class. The red prawns wrapped in ham were the best I have had.\nA hidden gem!","37344":"We had a short 3 night break at the hotel, food and facilities were very good, small but adiquate gym, great 25 metre pool. Disappointed to have to pay extra for the spa, which was very nice indeed. The hotel is a little way out and cost of transport to anywere could quickly add up. So if you plan to explore a car is needed. Hotel offered free bikes which you can explore the coastline with. We did this and would strongly recommend this. Food and service very good. Had an issue with the bill, charged each nigh for wine that we did not have. Quickly sorted on check out. Would return to the area and hotel","37349":"Stayed at Caiammari four nights and it was a unforgettable holiday. Such a beautiful place and park, beautiful rooms with S Ferragamo products, swimming pools, delicious top standard food and Sicilian wines, fantastic SPA, and the staff so warm, beautiful and attentive! We loved everything and want to come back.","37353":"Caiammari is a wonderful hotel and restaurant. Our room was spacious and comfortable. The place is well maintained by a delightful staff of eager young people who aim to please. The service is prompt and friendly. There are two large pools, and nothing is better than swimming on a hot Sicilian day.If you go there, make sure you pay a visit to the local winery. It is well worth it. Also, if you do go there, make sure you have a car. Public transportation is intermittent at best. The cost of taxi cabs can add up quickly.","37355":"Lovely place with excellent staff who made our stay so pleasant. Joseph, Luisiano and Lorenzo went the extra mile to make sure that us parents and our baby girl are all happy!\nReally enjoyed breakfast ever morning and we had our best dinner in the hotel\u2019s restaurant during our stay!\nOur room was spacious and always very clean. Highly recommend this place, on of our best holidays ever.","37356":"I expected a lot from this hotel. Unfortunately, my expectations never were exceeded.\nWe arrived rather late in the evening and were accompanied to our room, i.e. a large family room as booked. Although lacking some cosiness, it was ok. Until we tried to call the reception for some room service. The phone was dead. In the mean time, we had tried to put on the television, to no avail. We had to start looking for some help in the pitch dark, until eventually 3 people showed up to have a look at the television and to get the phone working. They managed to have the tele working, but the phone remained dead. Their offer was to change rooms where the phone would be ok (they said) and we gladly accepted. To our surprise, they had us move into a smaller room than the initial one, which was odd, since we were travelling with our 15-year old son. The phone was ... right, not working. We decided not to complain anymore and to try to make the best out of it. Deception remained, however.\nThe next morning, we all woke up showing multiple bug bites all over our bodies. I had 4 hugely swollen bug bites on my back. As I am writing this, they still have not completely disappeared.\nIn addition, the moist in the room (and the smell of it) rapidly turned out to be a real issue. Since Sicily was suffering from torrential rains during the time we were there, we needed our clothes and shoes to dry on many occasions. It simply did not work. Even clothes we had not been wearing or simple books got moist just by being in that room.\nOn the positive side: breakfast, dinner and the staff attending there were very nice.\nWe will not go back to that place, however.","37360":"This is a beautiful property with two lovely pools. The grounds are extensive and nice. It is very relaxing but you need a car to get around to Ortygia or Noto. Our room was massive, lovely and very clean. The bed was comfortable. Breakfast was mediocre and the staff were not very accessible or helpful. Otherwise it was a great stay.","37361":"My boyfriend and I spent 9 nights as this hotel in a Deluxe Double room in September.\n\nThis is an extremely clean, well-kept and relaxing hotel. The rooms, gardens and grounds are stunning and kept spotless.\nUpon arrival, we were given a gift voucher to use the spa for 1 hour \u2013 jet pool, sauna, steam room \u2013 it is beautiful and again, very clean.\nThe two swimming pools and outdoor Jacuzzi are wonderful \u2013 very clean and picturesque. Lots of sunbeds too.\n\nThe Hibiscus Restaurant is lovely and very relaxing, though with a fusion Sicilian menu, I wouldn\u2019t recommend eating here more than once (twice for a long stay). It is a fine dining menu and you won\u2019t find a pizza or pasta dish on the menu and it\u2019s quite expensive.\n\nThere aren\u2019t any other places to eat within walking distance. We asked the hotel for a recommendation which was closer than Syracuse as we didn\u2019t want to pay 50euros return for taxis. They suggested Ristorante L' Asteria Blu which was an 8min drive (though the taxi they called for us came from Syracuse so we still ended up paying 20euros to get there). I highly recommend Ristorante L' Asteria Blu. The food is fantastic. Especially the Linguine Scampi. You can also hire a boat from L' Asteria Blu which we did and it was wonderful!\n\nRe. hotel facilities, the phone in the room didn\u2019t work and the in-room hairdryer was very bad. You can borrow an iron from reception but there is no ironing board.\n\nBreakfast was a good choice of fruit, cakes, meats, cereal etc. There is a hot menu as well - scrambled egg and bacon are free. All other hot food must be paid for. We felt as though on some days we had to chase the staff around the restaurant to order hot food or coffee. We often laid the table ourselves.\n\nWe didn\u2019t hire a car and the location of the hotel is very remote. There are free bikes to get to the local beaches which are great. Though the bikes need a good service. For us, having free access to the bikes was a huge plus. It was the only way we could get anywhere without spending a fortune on taxis every day, but they are not well maintained. If you do use the bikes, I suggest cycling to Arenella Beach.\n\nA taxi takes about 15mins to Ortigia which is the heart of Syracuse and costs 25euros each way from the hotel. You cannot cycle to Syracuse as it\u2019s too far and the roads are too busy. It is difficult to book the hotel\u2019s shuttle bus other than for airport runs.\n\nThe gym equipment is good, though the hotel need to add air conditioning or at least a fan to the gym room so that you don\u2019t need to keep the doors open \u2013 my partner used the gym once and kept having to fight off mosquitoes.\n\nThe lunch menu is poor. For a hotel so remote, this really does need to be improved. The chicken salad is okay. But the variety and quality of the food as it\u2019s quite bland. Cocktails are lovely!\n\nMid-stay there was an event taking place at the hotel. We were disappointed that we hadn\u2019t been made aware beforehand. A note under the door or sign at reception would have been preferred as it was quite a large intrusive event.\n\nGiuseppe was very friendly and he gave us a few good tips.\n\nThe beauty of the grounds and cleanliness of the rooms make this a 4*. Though because of the points listed above, we feel inclined to rate the hotel an overall 3.5*.","37362":"I found this hotel the friendliest hotel I\u2019ve ever stayed. We were travelling with our two year old daughter and found the staff absolutely amazing at looking after us and making our stay special. All the staff knew our daughter\u2019s name and made a special fuss over her whenever she was there. Nothing was too much trouble and there were plenty of genuine warm smiles and jokes. The large grounds with all the different plants were stunning and made it a really relaxing place to stay with a child. The restaurant was also impressive with some of the best food of our stay. Special thanks to everyone at the hotel - you\u2019ve got a really special bunch of people working at your hotel.","37366":"Excellent pool....could spend hours there and always very quiet. (I would note that the \u2018adult pool\u2019 is quite deep, I struggled to stand on the bottom at 6ft3 but it means it\u2019s reserved for swimming only which is great if that\u2019s what you\u2019re after)\nVery nice setting in its own botanical gardens. Breakfast good with varied cold buffet....they do charge extra for cooked food. Staff seemed a bit non interested in customers requirements (apart from the Argentinian bar man, who was excellent) maybe this is just Italian laid backness. Surrounding location lacked a bit to do but this hotel is for relaxing around the pool with a good book for that it is perfect.\n\nAdjoining spa area was not really explained properly when we arrived which led to confusion about whether or not you need to book to use the hot-tub (spoiler-you do!) but I had a nice massage there and the facilities are top notch if you choose to book them.\n\nThere are more beautiful parts of Sicily to visit but if you are looking for a relaxing base then this is it.","37367":"Just returned from 3 nights in this hotel. We had a family room which was spotlessly clean and spacious. I have stayed in many hotels but both myself and husband agree that this was definitely the most relaxing place we have stayed. The grounds are beautiful so is the pool, it was always quiet and plenty of sun beds. The breakfast in the morning was lovely and the coffee delicious. Will definitely stay again. Thank you","37369":"I have stayed at Caiammari and have enjoyed many events and diners there! Would highly recommend for its beautiful garden and very large pools, incredibly friendly and dedicated staff.\nSpent a a night at a party in their restaurant dedicated to Sicily recently where both the food and music made for an unforgettable night.\nThis is a great place to stay and relax outside of the craziness of Siracusa and Noto! Easy to get to both places while enjoying this beautiful villa experience.","37374":"We have spent five nights at this hotel with our teenager son and wish we had booked more. Not far from Syracuse and other sightseeing musts and beaches, it allows to enjoy your stay in a relaxing environment. The restaurant is absolutely fantastic (quality and refined cuisine), personnel is always kind and ready to give you helpful advice and suggestions for your tours. One swimming pool suitable for small kids, another large swimming pool for adults. Whirlpool is also available. Relaxing botanic garden, fitness room and spa. If we go back to Sicily, this is certainly a place where we would like to stay again.","37380":"Absolutely lovely hotel, beautiful pool and lovely setting. Breakfast was totally delicious with a great choice including fresh fruit. We would just drop half a star for the service occasionally lacking slightly - e.g often no one to give out towels, difficult to get a coffee in the morning (we asked and on a couple of occasions had to remind after 10 minutes of so as they had forgotten) Overall, the place is fabulous and would definitely recommend to family and friends.","37385":"We have live at this Hotel many times, both our family and with many friends.\nThere is only one word about this place and the staff; FANTASTICO!!\nThe Hotel is 4 star but should really have 5 star because of all Hotel in the word we have been to - this place is number one, absolutely!\nThe staff make everything to feel that the place is really your own home and this is the feeling from the first meeting with the staff at the reception to the Manager with his staff att the restaurang, the poolbar and all the very nice and proffessional cleaning staff.\nThe staff in the kitchen are so good and make everything to help you with a big heart in everything they do and if you dont find something in the meny only ask and they do everything to help you to have what you want-fantastic!\nWe have in many years 100-120 days every year at Hotel both in work and holidays and we always go back to this place and really recommend everyone to go here-Love everything at Caiammari, you are the best!","37390":"My wife and I really enjoyed staying at this small hotel - with excellent facilities. The pool area is extraordinary big for a relatively small hotel. The staff were the most welcoming that we have met for a long time. Sofia in the admin team accommodated a change in the date despite it being initially a \"no-change\" booking. If you are looking for a small oasis of tranquillity look no further, Very conveniently located 10 mins from Syracuse and a base for visiting SE Sicily or simply relaxing and using the SPA.","37394":"This is a nice serviced apartment right in the heart of Ortigia, walking distance to everything on the island. The rooms are very nice, well presented and with excellent facilities. We had a room with a balcony with a partial view of the sea which was extremely nice. The accommodation is reasonably priced at around 100 Euro a night. My only criticism was the rather indifferent attitude of the young man who checked us in, a trainee I believe, so he is obviously learning. But he needs to more customer friendly not so abrupt and more welcoming and helpful. Every time we asked a question he responded in a very disinterested and abrupt manner. Also beware if parking in the region - you need to find one of the central parking areas to avoid being towed overnight.","37396":"In short, the place is beautiful, clean and well maintained. But don't bother ordering the breakfast.\n\nIn long:\nNot many of the front of desk spoke much English (more our fault for not speaking Italian) but lots of smiles. The main host was incredibly helpful when we checked in, with fantastic restaurant suggestions. Not so friendly when we checked out though, perhaps distracted by people checking in, but a \"see you again soon\" or \"did you enjoy your stay\" would've been nice as we had planned on returning next year.\n\nWe stayed in a \"city facing suite\" - don't be deceived, it was overlooking the alleyway and right into our neighbours sitting room! But pleasant and quaint enough.\nNowhere to fold away clothes so had to live out of a suitcase. But these don't detract from the charm, just mere observations.\n\nMy only negative would be the breakfast. 2 croissants and 4 pieces of bread with jams and butters in a little dish. Even a bit of fruit would have tarted it up. No napkins and no knives to spread the butter and jam... we had to use the backs of a spoon!! It's just not worth \u20ac10 and would highly recommend either going to the supermarket down the road, or enjoy a breakfast out in one of the many local cafes.\n\nLastly, and not directly the hotel's problem but by association, the valet parking. It's \u20ac20 per day; which is not a problem given the convenience but be warned, our car was returned with grubby foot prints on the passengers side and the radio left blaring. Some one had had a jolly time driving around in it that's for sure!","37399":"Definitely check this one out if you\u2019re looking for an exceptionally clean, new Serviced Apartment that is light and bright in a perfect location. I travel a lot so having a kitchen is important me. Great WiFi, white sheets and air conditioning always ticks the boxes. Moments from the sea and everything you should see, eat and do is right there. We had a fantastic band playing on their rooftop bar overlooking the sea on Friday\u2019s don\u2019t worry they finish in plenty of time for a quiet night\u2019s sleep. Make sure you check out the markets - particularly on Saturday - they are literally 15 mins away, the team are exceptionally helpful and friendly and a nice well dressed clientele seems to like the trendy Jewish Quarter which is where the apartments are located.","37402":"Though our room was a mini apartment and the accommodations were generous in size and we even had a view of the sea down an alley, what could have been an Outstanding Experience was less than that due to the front desk or management. We were there for 2 nights on a Rick Steves tour. Other guests were noticeably treated more kindly. An example being that coffees were delivered to their breakfast tables while ours were not. Also we were charged 20 Euros for the change of our sheets when the sign in the room only indicated that if a change were requested please leave a card on the bed with no mention of there being a fee charged for the service. We assumed -- wrongly -- that the policy was similar to that of towels which many hotels ask guests to re-use but do NOT charge them if they opt to do otherwise. The \"sharp practices\" of the hotel and its disparate treatment of guests are reasons we cannot recommend it to others. Outstanding facilities when diluted with poor service = \"average\" at best.","37407":"This is a remodeled monastery I was told but the rooms now are spacious and lovely. In a great part of town, near the sea and the major plazas it is well located for finding delicious food or visiting the Baroque church that turns a lovely pink in the early evening.\nOur room was two large rooms with a kitchen and extra bed in living area and a little terrace as well\nThe staff is very helpful and sweet. We were here with Rick Steves tour but would return on our own.","37409":"A number of apartments in an old large building which has been extensively renovated to a very high and attractive standard. Our room had a seating and eating area, a small kitchen and a bedroom with en-suite bathroom. All rooms were attractively finished with good furniture, seats, bed etc. The room was very clean and comfortable.\n\nThe staff were very very friendly and helpful.\n\nThe only disappointing factor was the breakfast which every day consisted a small coffee, a small watery juice and some awful plastic bread with butter and jam. Each day it was the same and in complete contrast to the rest of the hotel. Hope they either stop offering breakfast or think about what they are doing. A bad breakfast is not a reason for not going there as everything else was excellent and we would definitely stay there again.","37410":"Great location & great service! Wonderful week in Ortigia- so much to see, everything close by & so many good places to eat especially round the fish market. Also great base for trips to Ragusa & Noto.","37412":"Our quarters were a spacious studio apartment with an area for cooking and dining if desired. Windows front and back gave good cross ventilation and a sea view. The hosts are warm and welcoming- almost like their own home. The bed and bathrooms are recently renovated, sophisticated and clean. The location in old Ortigia is excellent. We arose each morning to watch the sunrise over the Mediterranean Sea. Highly recommended.","37415":"The position was perfect and the decor was very sophisticated The bed was comfortable and the linen was crisp and clean. Danilo was incredibly helpful.\nThe only complaint was that the water was not very hot.","37418":"This charming hotel located in the heart of Ortigia was the perfect place for my 3 day stay in Siracusa. Tucked down a quaint alley way, the hotel was a quick walk to everything I wanted to see. I was greeted by Danilo who insured that my entire visit was positive. Always available for recommendations and catering to any guest requests with a smile, Danilo was an excellent host! I loved the stylish yet simple rooms and enjoyed the cafe area. I would stay at this hotel again in a heartbeat! I was sad to leave and hope to revisit this adorable hotel and it's awesome staff again soon!","37420":"We had a very nice welcome from delightful staff and were shown to a really spacious apartment ( no 4 ) a big bedroom with a very comfortable bed and bathroom with an excellent shower . initially I was delighted to see it had a decent hairdryer with a mirror above . Always a bonus ! However being only 5ft the mirror was too high and I could only see the top of my head standing on tip toes ! We also had a large sitting room\/ kitchen\/ dining area plus a sweet little terrace where we had our breakfast .\nThe only reason we have given very good and not excellent is because of the very disappointing breakfast ! This was served in our room although there were several very nice areas where breakfast could be offered however the main issue was what was served . This was nothing like what was pictured on the website or as described when we booked . It consisted of a fruit juice , a coffee , a croissant , 2 slices each of \u201csupermarket \u201c bread , one pat of butter and prepacked jam\/Nutella . However because we had a little kitchen we were able to buy cereal\/ fruit\/ yoghourt etc from a shop nearby. This didn\u2019t spoil our stay and we would definitely stay again but breakfast needs improving .\nThe location was perfect for visiting the sights and was in a little quiet side street . Good restaurants nearby and a lovely ice cream shop just round the corner .","37421":"The location is simply amazing in the Giudecca part of Ortigia, that is the heart of Siracusa.\nAn old palace finely restored. Just in front of the bagno ebraico and 2\u2019 walks from the Duomo square and on the opposite side from a rocky area where you could have a nice sea bath in the crystal clear sea water of this part of Sicily.\nThe apartments are large and well equipped from our you could see the sea.\nSimone on the top terrace served us, during the sunset one of the best Gin Tonic I have ever had in a real magic atmosphere.\nFew more words regarding the Director of the hotel, Domenico. He is a tailor with a great experience and an incredible capability of reading his guests\u2019 requests and building around them a bespoke experience. He makes us feeling at home and helped us during our stay with a lot of advices and suggestions.","37427":"We stayed at the Allegroitalia on a family holiday at the beginning of July .\nSet in a perfect location amongst the quirky bustling streets and a stones throw form the sea front .\nBeautiful 18th century building with a sympathetic and complimentary renovation creating modern contemporary apartments .\nThe staff were excellent , friendly and helpful and made our stay even more special .\nThe terrace is a great place for pre dinner drinks and to come back and relax after an evening of great food in one of the many fabulous trattoria close by .\nMissing this lovely place .","37436":"Stayed in this small hotel in late April and so glad that I followed my instinct and the wife's insistence that we book it and not the bigger more expensive hotels.....brilliant small boutique hotel on the south east of Ortigia only 5 mins walk away from main squares and 1 min away from coastline and small shingle bay.\nThe rooms are very spacious, big beds, and shower great...big plus for the wife was great hair dryer provided with plugs and mirrors so she was happy.\nThe best thing about this place are the Staff....top top friendly well informed locals, Special mention goes to Danilo who recommended top local restaurants but not forgetting Dominick and Gabrielle.\nTake my advice.....book and stay here.","37443":"We were a party of two couples and were all more than pleased with the quality of this hotel and the excellent hospitality offered by the staff. Gabriella made sure that both couples had rooms with sea views but there is also a terrace and several other balconies for guests to use whose rooms do not have this so no one misses out. We loved the location as we could easily walk everywhere but were in a private and quiet location on Ortigia. Beautifully renovated and well appointed in a modern tasteful style, this hotel is very good value. There is a bar and a breakfast room on the main floor and an elevator to the rooms as well as stairs. Thank you Gabriella and Domenico for a memorable stay!","37446":"If you visit the ortigia, the allegroitalia is the place for you to spend the night. Located right next to the seaside on the outside of the ortigia, it is in comfortable distance to the piazza duomo, fonte arethusa and the castello maniace yet far enough to escape the noisy tourists. The 18th century house was newly refurbished and its halls, staircase and lobby offer an intimate yet welcoming atmosphere in bright white.\n\nMy room (Nr. 9) was quite spacious had a comfortable bed, view on the open sea, a private balcony, a coffee machine for the perfect morning routine, it couldn\u2018t really offer more. Even from the bathroom there was a amazing view on the sea, needless to say without any neighbour looking back at you.\n\nDomenicos Team doesn\u2019t hesitate to help you in any way (or language) and give good advice what to see (and not to), where the best spots to eat are and so on. They make you feel perfectly comfortable as their guests and are without a doubt genuinely engaged to be the best hosts possible. I highly recommend to stay there. Thank you for a couple of very relaxing days!","37453":"We came to stay here by chance since our experience in the hotel across the alley (Hotel Alla Guidecca) was terrible, we left them and were delighted to escape to this lovely find! It has the charm of the old 15th century style but completely modernised and fresh, there was natural light in every corner. Having an espresso machine in the room and an elevator makes a big difference in the quality of the stay. It was the most comfortable 2 nights in Ortigia. The staff were all very friendly and helpful, especially Lucia! Check out the terrace on the roof with spectacular views of the sea and a great spot to have a quiet breakfast or a drink at sunset. Location is great! But realise there is no car access to the cobblestoned alley where access to the hotel is so be prepared to share the area with the locals living around it.\nBreakfast could be improved, but with so many delicious restaurants around, best to save your appetite for lunches and dinners out on the town.","37457":"We booked a last minute deal to Ortigia so didn't really know what to expect and we were absolutely blown away by the hotel. Great location, amazing decor which mixes tradition with a clean, modern feel and a great room.\n\nThe room was spacious, clean and had a view of the beautiful sea. Bed was extremely comfortable and had air conditioning.\n\nThe hotel is in a great location on the island of Ortigia, perfect for exploring what the island has to offer and close to bus stops should you want to venture further like we did.\n\nThe staff were extremely friendly and helpful, giving us great recommendations on local restaurants and cuisine and just being a genuine helping hand and smiling face every time we walked through reception. A special thanks to Lucia, we spoke to her a lot (apologies if it's spelt wrong) on many occasions and she was particularly lovely, always smiling and wanting to help, so many many thanks to her.\n\nBreakfast is small with the selection including cereals, local pastries, bread rolls and fruit, but it was nice not to be inundated with heavy fried foods that hotels normally like to cater for us Brits. Can vouch for the cappuccinos as they were delicious.\n\nWe didn't get a car in the end but parking is available although might take some skills squeezing into a space or driving around the tight lanes on the island.\n\nCan't recommend the hotel enough and hopefully we'll be back in the future x","37463":"This B&B has a great location in Ortigia, not far from many very nice restaurants and close to the historic center. Only negative is that it is about a 30 minute brisk walk from the train station, other than that it's a very clean and quiet place to stay. The breakfast is very nice and served on a beautiful terrace that overlooks the city and the waterway.\nI would definitely stay there again without hesitation!","37464":"My husband and I stayed for two nights in this neat little hotel in Siracusa. We liked the location - just over the bridge in Ortiga and by the water, but on a quiet street off the beaten track. We parked on the mainland in a public lot close to the bridge and walked our suitcases over to the hotel - very easy - and while it turned out there was parking just outside the hotel on the day we arrived, we were pleased that we had opted for a public lot where we did not have to worry about parking in restricted zones, the car being broken into or damaged in on-street parking, etc. There is a lift up to the hotel which is great for transporting luggage, Our room was simply but pleasantly appointed (everything white and blue), clean, with a large window\/door overlooking the water, and a nice bathroom. The hotel is within easy walking distance of all the major sights. Staff were pleasant and helpful, and the breakfast served in a pleasant, bright dining area, with the option to eat outside on the terrace, was excellent. Highly recommended.","37465":"This B & B is fine. We got wrong when choosing the attic room and did not have ventilation, it did not have any windows and it was a bit claustrophobic. But it was very clean and very welcoming. The very complete breakfast served on the terrace is perfect. Very attentive staff, help you in any doubt you have and help you find car parking because it is difficult to park in the Oritgia area.","37466":"We spent 2 nights here. We wish it was longer! It is just over the bridge to Ortygia, so an excellent location right on the canal with a view of the Harbor. You can walk anywhere on the island and just a 30 minute walk to the ancient ruins. WiFi was good. Breakfast was excellent. Staff very friendly. If you have a car and give advance notice someone will meet you to park it for a fee, which is very helpful. If we come back we woul definitely choose this hotel again.","37467":"Loved this place! Location was perfect, parking was a breeze. We were lucky to find a place to park our car right across the street. As Ortigia is small, we didn\u2019t need the car to get from place to place. Breakfast was wonderful, views from our room were beautiful, room was bright and the staff was extremely courteous and helpful. Will definitely go back and would stay even longer. FYI, the is a hop on, hop off bus stop around the corner. for 5 euros pp. all day long.","37471":"We are regular visitors to Ortigia and have tried several accommodations over the years but the \u201ctrying\u201d stops here because the L\u201dApprodo seller Sirene is simply the best value place we have stayed. The location is ideal, it\u2019s remarkably quiet, rooms are modern and immaculately clean. Staff are exceptional and the breakfast fantastic. Talking of the breakfast, it is hosted in the upstairs sky room or roof with amazing views over the small harbor and adjacent Marina. This really is a gem of a place and we will without doubt return. Highly recommended. Well done to Fiora the owner, see you soon.","37480":"Well - what a gem! This place is absolutely perfect for people wanting small and in the heart of things. Very good location for restaurants, shops and bars. Small B&B with about 8 rooms very well equipped and homely. Even complementary bathrobes and slippers!. We had room 5 overlooking the harbour with a small balcony big enough for two chairs to sit and have a beer on and watch the world go by. Woke up the first morning to a beautiful cruise ship moored outside and we hadn't been disturbed at all. The double glazing is good. Local fishermen outside mending nets , laughing and talking etc. We love local colour and are very happy just doing what the locals do. The room was quite big and the bathroom was fine with a walk in shower. The bathroom needs a bit of attention d\u00e9cor wise but it had everything needed. The breakfast in the terrace was really good with lots of choice all the usual things but also nice touches like the cannoli that you put your own cream in. There is a roof terrace where you can just sit and relax and watch the world go by\/ The staff were really friendly and helpful and very pleasant. We arrived a bit late because of a delayed flight but that was no problem. The girl showed us where to park for free and the car stayed there for two days while we walked around Ortigia and explored. The lift is a real benefit too. Also air conditioning in the room if needed. Good security as there are two locked doors to the property.","37481":"Lovely hospitality. Very helpful staff and excellent position. The front door is not obvious when you first arrive but very user-friendly thereafter. The rooms were clean and comfortable with a good spacious bathroom and the terrace overlooking the harbour was a delightful place for a drink. Siracusa itself is charming and impressive with plenty to see.","37482":"With a fantastic location on the quayside in Ortigia, L'Approdo delle Sirene is ideally located for a short break or longer in Siracusa.We stayed here recently for four nights and are full of praise for this charming boutique hotel.We opted for a standard room which although it was at the rear of the hotel was tastefully decorated,and had a fantastic bathroom complete with towelling robes and slippers. The bed was very comfortable and we slept extremely well. Breakfast was of a generous buffet style, and you could even make your own cannolo. Beautiful panoramic view from the terrace, and the sunsets are not to be missed.Staff were friendly, polite, helpful and well informed.Have already recommended L'Approdo to friends who are thinking of visiting Sicily especially Ortigia.","37483":"This was our first time visiting Sicily. The lovely boutique hotel is located on a pleasant street next to the water.\nThe staff was very helpful arranging parking for our car and checking us in. Our room was perfect, clean, modern with a wonderful terrace overlooking the water. A canal ran next to the street and it was so pleasant watching the fishing boats leaving and returning, My wife Trina and I are hopeless romantics and watching sunset from our balcony was so enchanting. In the morning we went up to the roof terrace to have a scrumptious breakfast with a wonderful view. Fresh croissants, breads, fruits, preserves and that delicious \"Red Orange Juice\" made from Blood Oranges. The Cappuccinos were delivered non-stop. The staff was so friendly and helpful with suggestions and directions. We were in easy walking distance from EVERYTHING! And then there was the wonderful treat of the owner, Fiora. I do a lot of research before booking and I had pleasant exchange of emails with Fiora as well as a 20 minute phone call with Fiora. That call cost me 6 cents with my Viber Out app.We had been interested in a cooking class. Our Instructor and Chef and Hostess coincidentally Fiora. This turned out to be one of the highlights of our visit. Fiora met us in the morning along with 3 other guests and off we went to the market. GREAT!!! Fiora knew everyone there and as we went from stall to stall she explained to us what was best as she purchased all the fresh ingredients we needed for the meal we would be preparing. Then the short walk back to the hotel to Fiora's wonderful, large old world apartment which is in the hotel. Fiora put us all to work preparing the meal. Everything we made was from scratch. Squash Blossoms stuffed with cheese and anchovy; ravioli in a delicious sauce; a delicious fish cut int fillets and served with sauteed peppers and onions and artichokes. and Cannoli from kneading the dough to wrapping around the metal tubes, frying and stuffing with yummy ricotta cheese. Then we all went into Fiora's beautifully set dining room . We toasted with some chilled Prosecco stuffed our selves with the sauteed squash blossoms, some cheeses, the ravioli followed by the fish course with the sauteed vegetables.\nMaking sure to leave enough room for our home made cannoli and a cup of espresso. It was such a pleasure sitting and talking with Fiora and hearing about her history.\nWe have already recommended L'Approdo delle Sirene B&B to our friends. By the way, Fiora's son owns a restaurant Piano B. It is a 5 minute walk from the hotel and we sat at an outside table drinking excellent wine and eating the best pizza we had in Sicily. Brava to Fiora for this wonderful experience.\nGrazi,\nTrina and Joel","37484":"This was a great place to stay while touring Ortigya. It's on the outskirts, so it's quiet, amazing view of the canal and port, easy walk to the center. Park in Talete and walk over. The B&B is well run, with someone at the front desk throughout the day and into the night, and they were all very helpful and professional.The room was a good size, with a very large bathroom and a modern shower (a marvel in Italy), oddly dark paint on bathroom walls.Breakfasts are served in their upper indoor & outdoor terrace area, beautiful view of the port. Very extensive selection of fresh fruit, yogurt, pastries, cheeses, hard boiled egg, I would highly recommend this B&B to anyone travelling to Ortigya.","37485":"Great location, lovely fresh clean rooms with excellent bathrooms elevated above the street and some rooms overlook the water. Great breakfast on the rooftop. The staff are really helpful. We would highly recommend this B&B and would definitely stay there again.","37487":"Reputations are hard earned and maintaining them even harder so full credit to L\u2019Approdo Delle Sirene for doing such a great job.\nThis B&B is in a convenient location, but not in the centre of Ortygia, which matters little as it\u2019s a small Island so getting around on foot is very easy.\nParking can be quite challenging, but that\u2019s the case in most popular resorts, so might require a little patience.\nIt\u2019s fair to say that this B&B is quirky, in the most positive way.\nAs you enter into it you are faced with what feels like a portal into an ancient stone walled inner fortress.\nThere is then an iron gate before getting to lift which requires you to depress the lift button fully until you get to Reception.\nThere are only a small number of rooms and we booked one with a Sea View which was excellent.\nThe Room was clean with Mini Bar, Hair Dryer, Kettle etc and a comfortable bed.\nThe Breakfasts were extremely nice and I\u2019ll miss that fresh crusty bread which was fantastic!\nYou also get the beautiful Sea Views from the Deck area.\nSometimes if everyone descends for Breakfast at the same time it could be a little tight.\nThe WiFi was very good.\nThe people there were very helpful and courteous and made us feel welcome.\nGiven its popularity and limited number of Rooms booking well in advance is highly advisable.","37488":"We chose L'approdo delle Sirene B&B for a 2 night stay based on its reviews, and we certainly were not disappointed. After negotiating the very secure entry, we were met by very helpful staff, and shown to our suite on the top floor. The room was located at the corner of the building, with small balconies overlooking each street and lovely views over sections of the canal and ocean bay. The room was light and airy, spotless in presentation, and had a very nice clean bathroom. Breakfast each day was on the upper terrace area. The breakfast was top class and plentiful, with fresh produce, yoghurt, pastries, and coffee prepared fresh by the morning staff. Highly recommend a stay if you want a lovely smallish B&B in an excellent location.","37489":"L\u2019approdo Delle Sirene was a beautiful little B&B on Ortigia island. Service was very attentive and Noame was very pleasant and helpful to us during our stay. The breakfast offerings were good and there was plenty of fresh fruit as well as some protein offerings and cheese. Overall a great small B&B and would return again if in Siracusa.","37490":"Google maps navigated us there from the airport without any tricky stuff.\n\nOur plane was late so they called me to confirm I was coming. I got billed an additional \u20ac30 for the late arrival and I don't think the airline would be minded to help out there.\n\nThe room was good, the breakfast was just what we needed before setting out for a day. The location was excellent for us; all we wanted to see was in walking distance, the local restaurants were very good. Parking was easily sorted out and the staff were friendly (apart from the late arrival charge).\n\nWould we stay there again? Yes, certainly.","37491":"Just avoid this place. Room 2 which I was given , about 3 meters from the reception desk . Zero privacy, view of a courtyard with scaffolding , tiny room , tiny toilet\n\nReceptionist was so rude and unwelcoming . Told me if im not happy I can leave to which I did, as we wasnt going to change my room . We went else where and had a fantastic time. He then charged me 90 euros for the room which he said wouldn't happen . The whole B and B is a joke really ,\n\nDO YOURSELF A MAJOR FAVOR AND 100% BOOK ELSEWHERE .","37494":"Perfect in every way for us. Made to feel very welcome, excellent location, good breakfast, clean and comfortable accommodation plus parking much easier than we had anticipated. Highly recommended. Restaurant guidance from the owners was also accurate and appreciated","37495":"Stayed three nights in May at this lovely B&B. Highly recommend booking a harbor view room\nif possible. The roof top breakfast area is perfect, also nice for watching the sunset. Staff is very helpful, and even called us after we left behind a very valuable item. Location could not be better. We had them book the boat ride that was just around the corner for us and that was delightful as well. It does fill up, so book in advance!","37497":"L'Approdo delle Sirene is in an elegant building by the harbor on the Ortiega side of Syracusa. We had 2 units with balconies that had views of the harbor. They cleaned our rooms everyday. Breakfast was delicious with home made breads & cakes that Fiora baked. Fiora & her son-in-law, Daniel, made us feel at home from the start. We liked the restaurants they recommended for each of the 4 nights we spent in Syracusa. The B&B is a good base to visit Noto, Ragusa and Mt Etna. Ortiega is such a lovely area to stroll around specially along the sea wall. The main piazza in front of the cathedral is beautiful! The narrow sides streets have interesting shops to peek into. Thank you, Fiora & Daniel, for making our stay so enjoyable & memorable!","37499":"We liked this place a lot. Great setting on the waterfront, but still quiet. Although we had the attic room, which didn't have a view, we didn't find this a problem at all given the hotel's roof terrace was only 20 metres away.\n\nAll of the staff were very helpful, English-speaking, and friendly.\n\nBreakfasts were a highlight. Very wide range of fruit, bread, home-made sweet and savoury pastries, squeeze-it-yourself orange juice, which you can eat either in the enclosed breakfast room - which has great sea views - or on the open terrace just up the steps with even better views.","37505":"Lovely comfortable quayside B&British on Ortigia island at Syracuse. Great breakfast helpful staff nice en suite bathrooms. Close to restaurants and sights....very good all round.nicely re furbished with modern Italian style.","37508":"Stayed here in late November in a nice clean and comfortable room overlooking the harbour. Breakfast was delicious and plentiful, staff charming and helpful. Ortigia out of season thoroughly recommended","37509":"We had previously stayed at the L'Approdo delle Sirene for two nights in 2006 and fortunately it remains as good as it was then. The room was quiet, clean and comfortable. The breakfast is great and the staff helpful with advice and sorting out free parking in front of the entrance. We used it as a base for visiting other parts of south east Sicily (Modica, Ragusa, Noto and Catania).","37510":"I spent 4 nights in this lovely establishment back in October...great location next to the harbor...a spacious room and a bright sunny rooftop terrace in which to enjoy your morning breakfast....the staff are friendly and offer lots of good tips on what to do locally.","37511":"Stayed here 5 years ago and was happy to come back - lovely location central (on Ortigia), but quiet. The breakfast on the roof top bar remains a delight. Staff friendly. Plenty of restaurants close at hand.","37515":"We spent two nights at this fine small hotel, right on the estuary between Siracusa proper and Ortigia. The room was comfortable and quiet. The location made walking anywhere easy without having to bring the car into Ortigia and search for parking. There are plenty of things to see and do and two days are probably not enough, but this hotel made every minute count for a restful and fine visit.","37516":"This is very well located, just as you cross the bridge into Ortygia. It overlooks part of the harbour and is away from the busy streets at night, so we slept very well. The owner is very helpful and pleasant.\nWe had a room with a balcony on two sides, one overlooking the harbour\/bridge area, with just enough room to sit and relax. The room was clean, spacious, light and pleasant with good air conditioning and was well equipped. The bathroom was small but fine and everything worked well.\nBreakfast is taken on the top floor, overlooking the harbour, you can sit outside or in. The buffet breakfast was excellent, with delicious freshly prepared options such as tomato bruschetta, good pastries, cake, tarts and cannolo, meat and cheese, good juice and the best proper pot of tea prepared for me during my whole holiday!","37518":"This hotel is the most ideal location - near the harbour and the water, near the historical centre, near the market and near the bridge to leave Ortigia. We absolutely loved our stay there! Fiora was always professional and prompt in her emails and Daniele at the front desk was so welcoming, helpful and accommodating. Daniele was also extremely helpful in finding us parking close to the hotel (we were literally right in front!). Our room was clean, had a safe to lock valuables, a mini-fridge and the wifi and air conditioning worked perfectly. The upstairs terrace is also wonderful with a great view and breakfast there is amazing. Lots of options (even pancakes!) and in such a nice setting. We highly recommend this place and everything seemed so perfect here it made our trip so relaxing. Grazie mille!","37545":"Kind receptionist, breakfast -nothing special, not so many options, clean room but shower was worn out, private spacious parking . A little bit overpriced for offering basic things, but for one night stay is ok.","37685":"We booked this hotel for one night only as we wanted to visit Syracuse before a morning flight from Catania. Although modern, the standard of finish was disappointing. The walls to our room on the ground floor were not soundproofed and the noise from doors closing and people talking in the corridors woke us several times. Parking was secure and the breakfast was ok. We were hoping to leave the car and get a taxi into Syracuse staff advised not to do this as the costs were likely to be excessive. The pool was in need of a clean, but to be fair to the hotel the previous night had been windy which may have explained soon of the debris within it.","37726":"We booked a week in Siracusa, and Dario was very nice to wait up for us, when we came later than expected and couldn't contact him. We were greeted by a very kind host that made it a very pleasant stay!\n\nThe interior is very fine and tastefully furnished, and the room was almost a tiny apartment, with good toilet facilities, good beds, nicely isolated from noise and heat!\nWe came with a smaller baby, and although they didn't have a baby cot, that was taken care of the next day; really nice service!\n\nThe breakfast is fine with some of the best coffee I've had in all of the places we stayed in Sicily.\nThe place is situated right next to a busy street, but you didn't notice it, not in the well isolated rooms or when getting breakfast. The exterior is very beautiful and clean, and it was very pleasant to just stay outside and have an extra cup of coffee. And the service at breakfast was really nice!\n\nThe surrounding area, apart from the necropolis, didn't have that much to offer, but a 20-30 minute stroll will get you to Ortygia, so that's not really an issue if you like to walk.\nWe had a rented car for 3 weeks, and we were so glad that it was possible to park at the premise. With a bit of practice it's okay to get out of the parking area (you should always approach the entrance from the top of the hill!). Having Dimora Archimedea as a base when driving in the surrounding area was also easy. Getting to the highway takes maybe 10 minutes, so that worked nicely, and we drove to Noto, Palazzo Accreide, Ragusa and Marsameme from there.\nThe locally produced olive oil from Dario was really nice and followed us during our journey in the rest of Sicily!\n\nSo bottomline:\nIf you don't mind walking to the most interesting part of Siracusa, which is definitely Ortygia, I would highly recommend this place :)","37727":"Before we arrived Dario communicated what we should do on arrival as it\u2019s a B&B and not a standard hotel . Dario provides maps and places to visit and eat .\nThere is plenty of space to park your car\nThe room we had was small , but not a big issue as we spent time in the courtyard or out site seeing .Breakfast has plenty of choice and it\u2019s a lovely house close to the archeological site . I would recommend the hop on hop off bus for \u20ac5 per day","37737":"Ditto to all the praise that Dario richly deserves. Dario kindly guided my \"upgrade\" Ford Galaxy minivan (thank you so much, Hertz, for \"losing\" my reservation for a small Fiat, even though I'd checked on it the day before and produced the printout) into his parking area, where I gratefully left it for 3 days. Although Diimora Archimedea is on a busy road, the double doors, doubly glazed, blocked the noise. We had no trouble walking to Ortygia. Thanks for a lovely stay, Dario.","37738":"This is the most beautiful house, with wonderful decor, a great atmosphere and such a kind host. One of the best B&Bs we\u2019ve ever stayed in, anywhere. Dario and his team are very welcoming, and every attention to detail is there. Breakfast is excellent, and taken either in the garden, or together round the table in the dining room. Dario supplies a list of good places to eat in Syracuse, which is very helpful. We\u2019ll be back!","37765":"My husband and I spent several weeks here during multiple trips last year in August and cannot rave more enthusiastically about Francesca's welcoming BnB. The property is a flower filled oasis of about 8 rooms, all individually decorated in her signature artistic style. There's also a lovely private cottage perfectly suited to families or small groups. What makes this place truly special is the owner Francesca and her family. Every morning she warmly welcomes every guest in their native language (Italian, French, English) and breakfast is served individually to each table in the lovely loggia attached to the villa. Although it's not a la carte, Francesca goes out of her way to cater to individual tastes. The breakfast is a generous selection of pastries, crepes or eggs, fruit, and daily surprises to keep palates entertained. It's Italy so of course the coffee is espresso and great. Many of the guests are regulars and over the years have gotten to know each other so there is a really lovely camaraderie each morning as guests share stories of their trip and plan where to visit next. We had some wonderful nights singing songs and solving the problems of the universe under the stars with other guests and family members. Francesca's 3 fox terriers Maya, Frida and Bianca are really the stars of the show as everyone lavishes them with cuddles and no doubt illicit snacks. The dogs are loads of fun but if you're not into them they will happily leave you alone to play out amongst the lemon and olive trees on the property. We adored them and miss them terribly! The location is surrounded by truly gorgeous Sicilian beaches all within an easy bike ride or short car ride. The nearby ancient town of Ortigia is spectacular and is loads of fun on the weekends with music on every corner and a lively atmosphere. There are trains and buses to take you to all the nearby tourist destinations and we loved the ancient town of Novo and Ortigia equally. You are surrounded by wine country so could easily spend days drinking your way around the area or you just buy it at the local mini mart and drink the delicious Nero d'Alba on the beach as we did...every day!\nLemontree Gard'n BnB is truly special - its what happens when true Sicilian hospitality and creativity come together with heartfelt intention. Its like being warmly embraced by an Italian mother you never knew you had, and who doesn't want that?!","37776":"Beautiful garden, very welcoming host and perfect location to make day trips to Syracuse, Noto, Ragusa, Modica etc. Not 5 stars because the room was a little moisty, but this might not be a thing during the hot Sicilian summers :)","37839":"Two couple exploring Siracusa for the first time. Giovanni was incredibly available and helpful. He had lots of tips about the area, restaurants and things to do. The location is perfect - right over the bridge in Ortygia - so easy access to all the historic sites, eating and drinking and the public transportation in Siracusa.\n\nRooms were fine. Clean and everything worked well. Good breakfast.","37840":"We booked here 1 room and another one last minute on the same arrival day. Well this was not a room good even for the owner family member. I do understand the room is tired and old and I wouldn't write any review because of that but since the minimum standards of cleanliness were not there, unfortunately all the travellers have to see this. The room was terribly dirty and so disgusting:\nHair on the Shower rug;\nDust on the floor;\nPaper from provious guests inside the bin;\nShower so dirty and old;\nBroken headboard;\nI wouldn't sell a room like that at all. Plus all the B&B is so noisy at 3am, after having a night out and drunk a bottle of wine and few cocktail with friends and back at in the room around 1am, been woken up by the noise of few local parents having a chit chat down the street and their kids were playing football with a empty bottle of water! So I went to the balcony and asked to stop. Then at 6.30am the garbage truck and after few minutes the delivery to the local shops on the back, woke me up again. Horrible night overall. The rest as old and broken furniture you can see from the pictures. Plus the toilet is stinks as hell. No shampoo or shower gel provided unless you ask the owner. I will definitely not suggest to anyone since I am local and never bring anyone there. After report in the morning obviously I was not expecting a full refund at least for that relic room but not even the owner co-worker face which was not emphatise at all and kind of \"I don't care about what you are saying\" not even a sorry. So disappointed.","37863":"the rooms are very big, the prices were cheap and\nthe service personal was excellent !\n\nthe location was nearly perfect !!\nvery close to the city center. we had a beautiful\nview over the city from our room.\n\nhighly recommended !!","37890":"Usually I do not write recommendations as it is time-consuming, but this B&B really deserves it!!! :) It is a lovely B&B with a very kind and helpful owner who explains all the sights in beautiful Siracuse. Rooms and everything else very nice. Would definitely stay there again!\n\nCheers\nMarion, John","37967":"We loved Lakkios Residence. Our family of four were very comfortable in the large, spacious suite. The room was comfortable and beautifully furnished with antiques and comforts of home, such as extra blankets and bath slippers. The staff were so friendly and helpful. In fact, they responded promptly and personally to several inquiries we wrote via email prior to our arrival, which helped us to feel welcome even before we'd arrived. The breakfast pastries were delicious. The walk to Ortigia is pleasant in nice weather, but we did opt to drive there when it was cooler and raining. We would love to come back soon. It was so relaxing!","37970":"Overlooking the smaller harbour, large by any comparisons, the delightful and well run Lakkios was a delight. Our ground floor room had its own small patio was spacious and clean and although close to traffic was completely soundproof. The parking was free in front and the few yards to the colourful harbour with fishermen mending nets, playing cards and the setting sun was easy and the views breathtaking. We asked on spec for one night but stayed for two. Breakfasts are very good and the staff team speak English and are most helpful. A fifteen minute walk to Ortegia and the fine selections of restaurants was via a checkerboard of streets but we felt safe and the fort rewarding. We would choose Lakkios again.","38074":"we stayed here 2 nights. we stayed on the 3rd floor. we had a lovely balcony where we sat at the end of the day. the location is perfect. we walked every where. the room was large. very clean. breakfast was very good. the staff was very kind and gave us tips on where to eat. to park your car the best thing is to use the parking service.","38075":"Clean, friendly staff but have to climb stairs with one\u2019s luggage. Rooms ample but shower small and designed with no place to put soap or shampoo while showering. Breakfast including local sweets nice start for the day. Easy walk to anything in Ortigia. Greco roman ruins off Ortigia take longer to reach.","38076":"The rooms are cramped\/small and cluttered with furniture you dont use. There is no elevator. Only one plug in the room worked so I could only charge one item. The staff are helpful which is the saving grace. It's a cold breakfast with limited options.","38077":"We did not stay at the hotel, and the staff was so helpfull. They allowed us to store our bags there Even though we stayed next door. So friendly and great coffee! Also great food! The best service we have ever had","38085":"My wife and I stayed here for a night after a friends wedding.\n\nThe hotel is perfectly situated in town and is a stones throw away from the Cathedral and various restaurants and shops. Everything is in walking distance.\n\nThe staff were polite and friendly and gave us the standard information regarding how to get around and what to see.\n\nThe breakfast consisted of a lovely continental buffet.\n\nThe room was very large with high ceilings and with a balcony. The ceiling was a lovely feature that I can only describe as looking like the Sistine chapel. It was very unique.\n\nThere is also a car park just before the hotel if you follow the one way system which was very convenient.\n\nGreat value for money.","38087":"our stay couldn't at the hotel could have been better. the hotel is very centrally located Ortigia Island (5 mins walk to Duomo) on a quiet side street. the large room was was fabulously priced and had a gorgeous Juliet-Balcony, large bathroom and good AC. best of all: the lovely staff.","38088":"We enjoyed our two night stay here. Lovely large room with the most beautiful painted ceiling. Room 203. Our friends had room 301 which was much smaller and cramped compared with ours. Very good breakfast and very helpful staff. Highly recommend. Very central","38089":"An enchanting , comfortable and endearing hotel. Clean rooms, great shower and comfortable bed. Staff friendly and helpful. Next door is a fantastic restaurant, highly recommended. Conveniently located in the heart of Ortiga, short walks from places of interest. This hotel is a gem , not to big to be impersonal just the right size. Highly recommended.","38094":"We had a really nice stay here. Our room was quiet and immaculate, although I think the area can be noisy during busy periods. Staff were friendly and helpful and the location was perfect for walking everywhere.","38101":"Cute , recently remodeled hotel in upscale neighborhood. Helpful staff. Large rooms with super comfortable beds and plush towels.\nBus to train station and bus station at the corner. Many lovely restaurants in the neighborhood.","38102":"I\u2019ll start with the negatives.\nThe room we had was supposed to be a quiet room, but I\u2019m afraid it was nothing of the sort. Although it didn\u2019t face the street, it was close enough to suffer from the street noise. Our first night, Friday, we discovered that across the road was a music club. Now the music wasn\u2019t the problem, it was its customers, who gathered outside until about 3am and held very loud conversations. The next night, Saturday, I think the whole of Sicily gathered in the town and we had the same problem. Lots of street noise, shouting and motorcycle engines being revved most of the night. Sunday, saw the celebration of Santa Luc\u00eda, the procession around the streets in the evening was great fun. But, of course not everyone went to bed that early, so yet another disturbed night.\nThe shower in the room, had a mind of its own, not a steady stream of the correct temperature, but first hot then cold, so you had to keep your wits about you so you didn\u2019t get scolded or chilled.\nOne morning the internet was very slow, but the rest of the time it was fine.\nThe safe in the room was fairly inaccessible, as it was in the fitted wardrobe behind a door that was screwed shut. We weren\u2019t offered a key, then again, we didn\u2019t ask for one.\nThere was the usual folder you find in hotel rooms which normally have information in. Only this folder was empty.\nSo now to the positives.\nThe room was very clean and tidy, with a comfortable bed and room enough to keep our case open.\nThe bathroom was also clean and tidy.\nThe breakfast was as expected, a good supply of sweet cakes and croissants, tea and coffee.\nWe had one evening meal in the restaurant, and it was really very good.\nWhat really stood out though, was the service.\nWe had a slight problem when we arrived, when I discovered that I\u2019d dropped my wallet in the taxi that brought us to the hotel. When we informed the receptionist of the problem, she was straight onto the taxi company and my wallet was returned half an hour later. Thankfully an honest taxi driver.\nThe sum up.\nA good place to stay, if a bit noisy. Good food. And wonderful staff.","38103":"When we arrived we were shown to our room which was a disappointment ,It was quite soulless and although roomy overlooking the front oh the hotel was very plain. The bathroom also had a very noisy extractor fan. My husband asked if they had any other rooms but was told they were full. We unpacked and went for a walk. The hotel is very central for walking around. On our return again I explained how disappointed we were with our room as the photos looked so pretty. The receptionist then said she did have another room but hadn't shown it to us as it didn't have a good view however when we saw it we decided to move immediately as although smaller without any view at all except of a small courtyard it was more comfortable and cosy which suited us. Later I asked for 2 glasses for us to have a drink in our room , it seemed an unusual request however and was asked to give them back when finished as they were needed in the restaurant next door that evening!! There are lots of restaurants nearby and sights to see. Breakfast was quite adequate and plentiful . We must praise Francesca on reception who always extremely helpful.","38104":"This hotel is a real gem! The hotel is clean and very comfortable! Breakfast was delicious! The location is excellent! You can walk to the ocean and watch the sunrise! It's very close to the best restaurants and shops (Via Cavour and Via Roma). Also, because it's close to the centre of the island, crossing the bridge and walking to attractions in Syracuse is quick and easy. We would definitely stay here again!","38106":"We came to this hotel with very high hopes, and indeed found a nicely designed, centrally located, clean hotel, with very friendly staff. However, the beds were stiff and not comfy, the shower was tiny, there was noise from the street during the night which ruined our sleep (seems like there's a pub just next door), and the staff was half an hour late for opening the hotel in the morning and serving breakfast, which was very basic on top of that.","38110":"I was on holidays at the end of the year in Sicilia and spent 2 days in the Hotel Gargallo which is ideally located in the center of Syracuse.\nUnfortunately, I forgot my professional computer there. The team called me immediately and found a perfect solution to send it back. The computer was perfectly packed and arrived safely a few days later in France. I paid the cost of the of the transport but they didn't charge me anything more for the time they spend to find a solution and pack the item in spite of the fact that I had asked them to do so.\nThanks to all the team.","38112":"Left my noisy, claustrophobic room on a very rainy day to look for a better situation. Although it showed n\/a on line, I was checked in right away and shown to a room on the top floor with tons of windows, a large terrace, no rooms above or to either side. Nothing fancy but exactly what I was looking for. I realize that the experience might have been different had I not lucked into this room.\nDesk service friendly and knowledgeable. Large assortment of cakes, pastries for breakfast in addition to yogurt, cereal, etc.","38117":"We were thrilled with our stay at Port Marina~contact and reservation process was easy, Simona was so helpful with parking and sightseeing and restaurant advice. She even contacted our next host and set up our meeting.\nThe room was large, clean and looked over the harbor. The location was ideal.\nThe breakfast was undoubtedly the best we encountered in our Sicily adventure. This is truly a special place to stay in Ortygia. Grazie Simona!","38118":"If you are going to Sicily, Italy. You MUST book a room here. But, we fell totally in LOVE with Simona. She took such good care of us. Breakfast, WAS TO DIE FOR! Meat, cheese, bread, fruit, danish, jams, eggs, pies,etc. etc.Who prepares any kind of coffee for you. Well, I will start with coffee, then go to Latte, and then will you make me espresso? The rooms were lovely, the area was exquisite. Walk the area, become Italian everyone is wonderful! As Simona would say, \"And now we kiss.\" I love her! We will go back some day and once again, we will fall in love with Simona all over again.","38127":"There are some places that stay in your mind and heart forever and this is one of these places. Not only because of the central location, beautiful room with harbor view, and exceptional breakfast spread. But also because of the expert hospitality, personalized attention, attention to detail and genuine care for the guest experience. The hosts truly went out of their way to take care of us with great recommendations and help for everything we needed. We felt at home and can't wait to return. Thank you!","38128":"This delightful, beautiful & lovingly restored B & B is a must 'stay' if visiting Ortigia, perfect location for exploring all the sites & for arriving & leaving. Very easy Walk out the front door up the lane & you are in the main pedestrian area for great restaurants, shops & Piazza Duomo, less than 2 mins and the other bonus you are right on the Harbour.. just perfect and magic sunsets.\nNow for the divine B & B Porta Marina, run by the owners Simona and her husband who did most of the restoration. We had 'Romantic Suite, Terrace, Sea View, top floor with a huge roof terrace . The room is exactly as the photos show on the web. Very comfy 4 poster bed, great pillows, lovely linen, good storage, bathroom was good size for an old building, beautiful white fluffy towels, nice toiletries. - I loved this room We had our breakfast each day on our terrace Our sincere thanks to the lovely young girl that climbed the stairs to deliver us, fresh coffee, delicious fresh ripe fruit, pastries, cold meats, cheese etc etc a feast - we could have eaten downstairs in the beautiful reception\/breakfast area. Simona is a delightful, thoughtful, caring host .. she wants you to enjoy your stay not only at her B & B but also Ortigia & surrounds. Wonderful restaurant recommendations, organised transfers for us. Was in touch by 'whatsapp' before we arrived. Greeted us as if we were family. I can highly recommend this B & B and only wish we had stayed longer than 2 nights\nPerfect location for the fun buzzy markets, Piazza Duomo,Caravaggio's Santa Lucia just amazing..Archimede interactive museum, underground Jewish Baths","38129":"We have just returned from a 7 night stay at the \"B&B Porta Marina. We decided to upgrade and go for the suite on the 3rd floor, a nice room with a private terrace overlooking the harbour and great sunsets in the evening.\nAnother plus with this room is you are giving the option to have your breakfast brought up to have on the terrace, a nice little touch. Other wise it's breakfast downstairs, which is a lovely spread of local foods from cold meats and cheeses to cakes and pastries (including cannnoli). There's also fresh fruit, yoghurts and fresh bread from the local bakery.\nSimona and her husband are very helpful and great hosts and will help with what to see and do and also great places to eat. They can arrange airport pickups etc etc at a good rates.\nThe rooms are cleaned daily to a high standard, I would have no hesitation in recommending this lovely B&B. The only negative thing I would say is there are 60+ steps to the suite on the 3rd floor, which we did 4 or 5 times a day, the good news is you will be able to have that extra pastry or ice-cream knowing you won't put an ounce on.","38132":"We absolutely loved our stay at Porta Marina last month for my wife's 60th birthday treat. Simona was a perfect host - even down to arranging a birthday cake and prosecco - and was a wealth of knowledge and great advice every day over her sumptuous breakfast spread.\nThe building has been magnificently and sensitively restored and renovated by Giuseppe and the little touches are a thing of wonder - do ask him or Simona about the heritage of the tiled Virgin in the stairwell!\nWe found our room (101 - with a magnificent view out across the bay) to be very comfortable and quiet throughout our 5 night stay and would highly recommend a visit to this glorious haven of tranquility on beautiful Ortigia if you're planning a trip to Siracusa.","38141":"Simona is a great host and makes you feel at home in Syracuse as soon as you arrive. The b&b is well appointed, our bathroom was on the tiny side but this is about all we could criticize. The B&B is very centrally located, and if you are lucky (but only then) you can park your car in the neighbourhood...","38143":"Had a 3 night stay in the suite with terrace for our 15th wedding anniversary.\nSimona and her husband are wonderful hosts and very welcoming.\nIt is in an excellent location and we enjoyed having the terrace to watch the sunset whilst having a glass of wine.\nBreakfast was nice and Simona always happy and pleasant.\nParking was close by and I was glad for the advice of not to drive through the arch by a previous review.\nOverall would recommend this B&B for a relaxing stay in the beautiful Ortigia.","38146":"I\u2019ve been a Tripadvisor member since 2005 and, as you can see from my profile, after having vacationed in 5 continents and lodged in countless accommodations, I have only ever written another bad review. Mistakes happen and sometimes things are not up to par, but it\u2019s how management reacts to them that makes the difference.\n\nOur stay in this B&B from the 6-8th of August 2016, was pleasant enough. As other reviews have pointed out, the negatives were a very small bathroom, noise from the Port at night (our room was on the marina side where it was extremely busy at night with a next-door restaurant blasting music until 2\/3 am), a standard breakfast compared to other B&B we stayed at during our Sicily trip and the very difficult parking (which I will get to below). However, the room was well furnished and clean, the view from the Marina was beautiful, it was very well situated, and the owners (a couple) seemed nice explaining places we could visit.\n\nHaving read countless reviews, my main concern when visiting Ortigia was parking. We made reservations on two B&Bs in Ortigia and finally decided on B&B Porta Marina having been reassured by the owners the parking would not be an issue. When we arrived on the 6th of August we parked, as instructed, on the paying parking on the left side of the Marina. We spent the 6th and the 7th visiting Ortigia. On the 7th we received an invitation for dinner in another town close by. We were reticent to accept since it meant moving the car from the parking and coming back at night and we had seen the long queue of cars waiting to park in that same parking the night before. I spoke with one of the owners who assured us we could leave for dinner since we would be able to park on the street of the B&B when we got back as we were guests there. Therefore, we left for dinner, we came back found no place on the parking (as expected) and after queuing for 30 minutes in which the queue did not move an inch we decided to park in the narrow street of the hotel- which was no small feat! (we actually scratched our car parking it but thankfully we had opted for full cover insurance). We went to sleep and checked out the next day around noon and left Ortigia for our next destination.\n\nFast forward to April 2017 when receive an email from our Sicily car rental company explaining our rented car had been fined in Ortigia on the 8th of August and we must pay 45 Euros, as per the rental contract, for the administrative costs incurred in identifying us to the police. The fine notification (and the additional fine amount) would be arriving separately. Not knowing what we could have done to deserve a fine, we paid the 45 Euros and waited for the fine notification. It arrived on this 27th November 2017 to our address in Spain (we live abroad) and said we had been fined 126.06 Euros for entering the B&B street which is a restricted area. Thinking this was a mistake, since I remembered we have been told we had a right to park there, I emailed the collection company explaining we would lodge an appeal and called the B&B to get the necessary information to prepare it. One of the owners picked up and I explained the situation. She said it was probably a mistake and told me she would look into it, asking me I send the reservation info and a copy of the fine notification through Whatsapp (we later learnt we should have used the Booking.com\u2019s email feature so they can review the correspondence and assist us when things go wrong-as they did). I messaged the info and the copy of the fine notification and she messaged back informing me the police \u201cplay on the checkout date\u201d since she had only registered our number plate with them to be authorized to enter the B&B street for the 6th and the 7th. Reading that I realized she had made a mistake by only registering for two days when instead we had stayed two nights which meant three days- not two. This meant we could not appeal the fine since the police was right in stating we had entered the area without authorization: The infraction took place on the 8th because when we came back from dinner it was no longer the evening of the 7th but the early morning of the 8th (00:43). I drew her attention on my reply to her mistake by stressing we left her B&B on the 8th (not the 7th), but since she said there was the option of asking the police for a reduced cancellation fees of 25 Euros of the fine, and she seemed willing to fix it, we decided everyone makes mistakes and we would pay the 25 Euros instead of asking they pay the fine and the rental car company administrative costs for the mistake they made. She said on her message she would do everything the next day (28th November) and would let us know \u201cimmediately\u201d. Since, according to the notification, we could pay a reduced fine of 101.76 Euros if we paid within the next 5 days, we waited expectant\u2026\n\nWe never heard from her the next day. We chased her twice on the following days and finally got a reply stating we should not worry, that she had been to the police and had an appointment the next day and they were on it. After that, silence for almost a week and no replies to our message for updates. The 5-day deadline went by increasing the fine to 126.06 Euros. From their behaviour we understood that, contrary to what she had claimed, there wasn\u2019t the possibility of getting a reduced cancellation fine fee of 25 Euros anymore (as the police had probably told them in the meantime) which meant we should have paid the fine within the 5 days instead of \u201cnot worrying\u201d. However, we considered we were at least owned an explanation and wrote a message explaining how upsetting it was they had dropped from the face of the earth leaving us with a fine that was not our responsibility (they had made the mistake, not us) souring our memories of the trip. I also informed that this time we expected a reply or we would consider other venues of redress. We received an immediate reply in which she did the opposite of apologizing for not updating us as she had committed to (thereby costing us even more money), took no responsibility for the fine (instead trying to shift the blame on us implying it had been given to us on the night of the 8th to the 9th which, aside from the fine notification indicating otherwise (00:43 on the 8th), we had, checked in at a B&B close to Palermo Airport- 300 Km away- on the evening of the 8th so impossible to have been in Ortigia that night) and stated she was doing as favour \u201cletting us pay just 25 Euros\u201d. Unhappy with this reply we finally informed them we would seek legal advice and that we would write a review online (I tried on Booking.com but they informed me after a year it is no longer possible- thankfully on trip advisor it\u2019s two calendar years as per their review guidance). She answered again with the opposite of acknowledging any wrong doing and added \u201cI\u2019ve already talked to the police and trust me, this would be a favour\u201d- thereby confirming our above impression. If we had been informed of where things were at, we would have told them we don\u2019t ask for such favours -we\u2019d rather pay the fine.\n\nThis happened last Thursday. As of today (Thursday 14th December) we have sought and received legal advice and we will be deciding whether to pursue this further. In the end, all I have to say is, if you want to stay at this place, know that everything may be Ok\u2026until it isn\u2019t, and then be ready for a very unpleasant experience\u2026.","38149":"We only spent one night here but found it to be clean, comfortable, in an excellent location for exploring Ortigia, and with an extremely pleasant and helpful owner, full of tips and advice and fluent in English.\nOur room had a glorious sea view and although not huge was perfectly adequate. Given the age of the building Simona and her husband have done an excellent job converting it into a five bedroom B&B while retaining its original character.\nThe breakfast was very good considering that they are only catering for a small number, and it was the only venue during our Sicilian holiday that served freshly squeezed orange juice and that included some four star hotels. We also enjoyed the unlimited cappuccinos, each with a different pattern in the foam !\nIts position is a short distance inside the island and once having parked the car ( more about that later) it's an easy walk to the many historical sites and restaurants elsewhere.\nMany people seem to worry whether to drive onto the island or park on the mainland. We found it not too difficult and certainly easier than places like Noto where our recently updated satnav had no idea about the one way system. Our car was a Fiat Punta which seemed ideal for the narrow streets in the Baroque towns.\nSimona's advice on arrival is to drive the short distance from the bridge on the one way system to the Porta Marina arch but do not drive through it.\nWe did first time around and then shortly after were unable to turn back, having missed the B&B and had to continue anticlockwise all around the perimeter of the island to get back. Good way to get your bearings but a little frustrating.\nThe trick is to try for the carpark on the right towards the harbour just before the arch, then walk through the arch, turn immediately left, then left again down the narrow road ( Via Santa Maria dei Miracoli) and the B&B entrance is a few doors along on the left.\nSimona will then explain the parking. She has some sort of arrangement with the harbour side site (reserved place?) but I do not know the details as we drove through a second time and managed to find a spot on the other side--a very rare event apparently and not worth the risk of another island circular tour !\nSorry if this review has been more about parking than the accommodation but I wish I had had this info before arrival.\nIn conclusion we really enjoyed our stay and would happily use Port Marina if in the area again.","38150":"We've just had a wonderful 3 night stay at this small b&b overlooking a small harbour. The view from the room was amazing especially at sunset!\n\nSimona was a great host. Very helpful with great suggestions for eating and sightseeing. We arrived early but they were helpful and let us leave our bags until the room was ready. They even manage to save us a parking space right in from of the b & b, which was fantastic! As the b & b was very central we never moved the car again until we left!\n\nBreakfast was great with plenty of choice. All the guests sat together so breakfast was a great experience.\n\nIt could be noisy at night and in the morning with the window open but it wouldn't stop us returning again to this lovely place\n\nOrtigia was a lovely place with lots to see and do. Would certainly like to visit again one day.","38152":"This B&B was right in the centre of Ortigia next to the harbour. The view from our room was beautiful and to watch the sun set over the harbour was a dream. The B&B is typically Sicilian and very tastefully decorated. Parking can be done at the front of the B&B and is free if you park in the blue zones.\nBreakfast was served every morning which was self serve. There was always lots to eat and lots of choice, especially cakes!! Very central for restaurants and bars and the harbour.","38154":"This B&B was nice but could definitely be improved. The real highlight here was the breakfast, the cakes were particularly delicious! The location of the B&B is also completely fantastic, you can walk everywhere and there is free parking. Both members of staff were friendly and accommodating on the whole.\nHowever- the images for this place on Booking.com are very misleading- for a start, it appears that there is a communal balcony and this was not the case. Moreover, it stated that the standard room had a balcony also. The only thing the standard room has is a long window which can be fully opened but only looks onto an opposite wall. This is also the only window in the standard room, which makes the room very dark.\nAs well as this, the room is very noisy- especially at night. 3 nights out of 4 we were not able to sleep until 2am because there is a bar very close by which plays loud music. When we told the staff about this, they appeared more offended at the complaint rather than apologetic.\nThe room is dated, the lights don't completely switch off properly at night and could do with some general maintenance.\n\nI would suggest booking one of the three rooms with a balcony, as I'm sure the stay would be really perfect then- it was just the standard room which let the place down.","38158":"There was no one on site to check-in. We had to wait outside in 40 degree heat after telephoning until the hostess came from her home (no apology).  Our arrival was 20 minutes earlier than we expected but surely you would have expected this to be possibility in running a B&B or at least would advised there was no one on site. Effectively this is just a room for rent. The room could only be described as 'adequate' at best... generally clean but bedspread was stained \u2013 we were put in what was described as a standard room\u2026 not well lit and quite dull with a view directly looking into the window on the other side of the street. No coffee or tea making facilities and no access to be able to boil water because the common area downstairs is locked when the hostess is not there. We were given keys and then the hostess disappeared, supposedly to return and provide breakfast at 8:00am which was confirmed, as we had to leave early for our flight. We wanted a minimum of 30 mins to relax, eat and have a coffee before our drive to the airport. We came down at 8:00 sharp and told to wait outside the locked cage because they were not ready. Had to leave so missed opportunity to have breakfast. Told both we were unhappy and all the hostess could do was to tell us we were at fault because the extra 10 or 15 minutes didn't really matter. Then when we protested this wasn't good enough she wouldn't stop yabbering at us. Very rude person who should learn basic and standard customer service techniques. There was no attempt to offer us the chance to have a partial breakfast, allowing us to help ourselves to what had already been laid out\u2026 this would have been far better than the hostess' continued protests that in her opinion, the delay should make no difference to us.  We said we would review accordingly and by the time we hit the airport we received an email saying the B&B had registered us as a 'no show'. Difficult claim for them to make as we have a signed receipt, credit card payment print out and pic of us sitting in the street sweating. Would never stay there again or recommend on principle. Disgraceful behaviour!","38186":"Simona and Giuseppe are a most delightful young couple who have created a lovely bed and breakfast where three large and comfortable bedrooms look out over the Porta Marina and yacht harbour while two more rooms share in the stylish \"house style\" of colourful and antique furnishings, and efficient and clean en suite bathrooms.\nBreakfasts are served on a shared long table affording the opportunity to discover travellers from many countries and delight in their own tales, experiences and exploration of the amazing Sicily.\nWe stayed a week and left with fondest memories of a wonderful time and new friends. Simona speaks excellent English and will arrange nearby permitted parking for you. The location is ideally placed for numerous restaurants and Ortigia's many beautiful sites. Our second visit and we will return again.","38187":"We spent 4 nights here and enjoyed a room with a view of the marina. The building has been beautifully renovated and our room was most comfortable. Breakfast selection is excellent, the aircon is quiet and efficient, and the wi fi signal is strong. Full marks to Guiseppe and Simona!!","38188":"The place is run by a lovely couple who are most helpful and friendly. We arrived late but were met by Guiseppie who sympathised with our late arrival. Our room was at the top of the building and unfortunately had a strong smell of sewage. This was uncomfortable and was strong enough for us to think about moving hotels. We did complain and it was more or less dealt with. Apart from that everything was excellent. The breakfast was a decent continental selection served in a small atmospheric room. We had the top room with an excellent balcony giving a superb view over the bay and harbour, it was furnished with a table and chairs but a couple of sun loungers would have been appreciated since there was plenty room. Well positioned The Porta Marina is ideal for walking round the town and harbour.","38202":"* Host: Super nice Filippo! He came outside to welcome us and help with our luggage. Friendly and advised us where we should visit.\n* Facilities: lots of towels and amenities. Excellent WiFi. The best WiFi we have experienced so far during our 3 week trip in Malta and Sicily. He also gave us lots of free bottles of water, which was much appreciated!\n* Room: Super clean, decorated, spacious. Looks completely new. We had our private bathroom which was also super clean and spacious. Silent. Can\u2019t hear any noise from outside hallways or from the streets.\n* Location: About 30 min walk to the center Ortigia. Since we had car with us, it was good to have free parking areas and we wondered around on foot.\n* Breakfast; Filippo asked us what we wanted for breakfast and when I said Croissant with Nutella, he got it for us! Also lots of fruits was much appreciated.\n\nI\u2019m not sure if you can find any place better than this for such an affordable price. If we come back to Syracuse one day, we will definitely stay here again.","38206":"This was a lovely B&B situated a 15 minutes walk to the amphitheater site and a 10x15 minute walk into central Syracuse\/Ortygia. There were also plenty of buses from a stop a couple of minutes walk away.\n\nThe host was excellent, he was extremely knowledgable, breakfast was good and the rooms were beautifully kept.\n\nI thoroughly recommend this place, plus there is free street parking on the road outside.","38254":"Visiting Syracuse, neaded a place to stay, this pops up. The host is extremely friendly, even comes 2 hours before the appointed time - shows us everything, explains where to park, suggests where to go for a breakfast and where to go for dinner or lunch.\nThe room is incredibly clean, the furnishing is simple but adequate, the system is tailoured for efficiency - you can not leave the room with the lights on - as you take out the key, the lights go out..Great if you ask me..:grinning: The bathroom with shower is clean, you even have a bidet..if you need it..:yum:\nThere is a small fridge in the room, a balcony with a great view..all in the center of the city. There is also a vending machine in the floor, taking care of any sudden desires.\nThe elevator takes you to the 2floor, a shop is just behind the house and the bus line is 50m away.\nAll in all a great 2 day stay, in an impresive city, loaded with history and stories - great and highly reccomended!","38311":"Spent two nights in Ortigia Royal Suites on an end-of-season visit in early October. This old property is tucked down a narrow side street at the southeastern tip of Ortigia Island. It has been beautifully refurbished in keeping with the building\u2019s heritage. Our junior suite (with sea view) was spacious, luxurious and very private.\nBreakfast is offered in a local cafe just 400 yards from the property (reception provide you with a voucher for a simple continental breakfast).\nAll of the delights of Ortigia Island are within easy walking distance of the property.\nThe staff could not have been more friendly and helpful both before and during our stay. Highly recommended.","38317":"I'd give 6 points if I could. This hotel was by far the best we had on our trip across Sicily (out of 5 different accommodations).\nIt is located at the sea and in the old centre of town. We had a big room with sea view, which I would always book again, as the view is spectacular! The hotel is really new - an old palace renovated carefully and furnished with a lot of taste.\nThe breakfast buffet was delicious and all the staff were very friendly. There is also a breathtaking view from the rooftop terrace, which is very big. If you just cross the street, there is a cliff from which you can enter the sea, so spending a summer vacation here would also be nice.","38319":"We were so lucky to find Ortigia Royal Suite! Upon driving into Siracusa, after a somewhat stressful journey from Palermo, Ortigia\u2019s Christina was amazingly helpful and accommodating. She came and met our car, got in, and directed us to the hotel (yes, it IS that confusing driving through Sicilian towns). She then proceeded to make a dinner reservation for us, gave us a fantastic recommendation for a glass of wine and a snack, and ensured, overall, that we settled in well.\nThe next morning we had one of the most sumptuous breakfasts we\u2019ve ever had, anywhere.\nOur only regret is that we didn\u2019t plan to spend enough time in Siracusa, as it is a lovely town. I would recommend planning to spend 2-3 days there. Tons of charming cafes, restaurants and wine bars. LOTS of beautiful side streets with fabulous architecture.\n**On a side note, I highly recommend hiring a driver, taking the train, or a bus, to get from town to town. Sicilian highways all seem to be under construction (simultaneously) and once you\u2019re in town, the ancient streets are challenging to navigate, even with Apple or Google maps.","38320":"A lovely boutique hotel carved out of an 18th century palazzo (it took 10 years to create from the planning stage!) retaining some original features, away from the hustle and bustle of the Piazza Duomo but still within very easy reach of it. Just drop the car at the nearest car park and start enjoying wonderful Ortigia, with the cerulean blue Ionian sea gently lapping the shore below your balcony, or enjoy the view from the roof terrace: blissful... A good breakfast spread (with a very decent selection of savoury items, not always a given in sweet-toothed Sicily) and very helpful and friendly staff.","38373":"I liked this hotel, it had character. The staff were friendly and mostly spoke good English. It's quiet, the room was spacious, free parking outside, and it's only a short drive to the centre of Syracusa. It is excellent value for money. There was a good spread at breakfast, but like many of the breakfasts we had in Sicily, it was mostly cake and other sweet stuff, with a small amount of bread, cheese, ham, and boiled eggs.\n\nThe only niggle was that the door to the balcony didn't secure properly, but we left the shutters down whenever we left the room.","38376":"We stayed one night as a group of four on a cycling tour of Sicily.\nEasy to access secure storage for the bikes.\nClose to the railway station.\nI had booked a room for 4 with two singles and a double bed.\nSeemed clean enough.\nBreakfast was typically Sicilian, coffee quite good.\nNot great value for money compared with other places we had stayed.\nCould not pay by card as the card reader didn't work properly.","38407":"I stayed in this B&B last December. The B&B is in a central location, it is very nice and well equipped, very clean indeed. However I found few annoying things, first : one of the ladies (Luana) who was making the breakfast was a bit too curious, too many questions every day and especially when you just wake up (which is in my case the part of the day when I want to talk the less, or not at all), Luisa was great and very discreet, I appreciated her company and discretion. Marco (the owner) was very nice as well.\nThe other biggest concern was the noise, in the morning they start moving furniture very early and the washing machine is programmed to start around 7 or earlier, same for the dishwasher. There is not soundproof insulation so if there is a noisy child in the room attached to yours it will be like having him \/ her in your own room. Noise, noise, noise....please try to do something about it as it's a shame as the b&b is really nice.","38408":"We stayed here for two nights. It is in a quiet residential area near the archeological museum and park and the catacombs. You can park for free outside. Breakfast was lovely - cakes, yoghurts, fruit and coffee. It was clean and the hosts were very friendly. You can walk into Ortygia in 20\/30minutes or walk for less than 5 minutes to a bus stop where you can catch the electric tourist bus (\u20ac1) or the hop on hop off bus.\n\nWould happily stay here again.","38419":"The first major advantage compared to a lot of Sicilian properties is the ease of parking - right outside the front door. We had the one bedroom suite which we found excellent, equipped with a nespresso machine and pods. Very clean, modern, roomy and comfortable. There is a communal area for clothes washing with new equipment including a dryer. The owners Mum Maria looked after us for the first 3 days. She is very helpfull and speaks good English and also provided excellent breakfasts. This is good value and we can easily recommend it.","38428":"A newly established bed & breakfast in central Siracusa, Sicily within walking distance to the Ancient Greek theatre and the archeological park. Beautifully renovated and comfortable with a full kitchen and all appliances. This was our home base for six nights while we toured the south and eastern part of Sicily such places as Ortigia, Noto, Modica, Ragusa, Taormina, Enna, Agrigento, Palermo, the beach and many more places!! The owners, Marco and Pina, provided us with a full breakfast every morning that included your local pastries and delicacies, homemade desserts, cheese, cold cuts, a vast selection of fresh fruits, yogurt and so much much more. They fed us so well that on most days we skipped lunch and had a late supper. They are extremely great hosts, very friendly and attentive to all the guests and will even prepare you anything you like! They really go out of their way to make your experience in Sicily as great as it can be. They made our vacation very memorable and we look forward to going back one day. Thanks a million Marco and Pina!!!","38464":"Archinue was a great find in a somewhat disappointing Syracuse visit.\n\nProperty is located close to the train station and is quite nondescript from the outside but once inside is very modern and fresh. You have to make a time to meet the reception staff who were extremely friendly.\n\nThe room was large with king size bed, modern bathroom and kitchenette with all the necessities to cook etc (be mindful of the rules - wash up or there are fees). There was also a TV with local channels and decent wifi.\n\n\u201cFree parking\u201d refers to on street parking out front of the property and it was a little frustrating to find a space. You will likely have to do a few laps around the block to wait for a space to come up.\n\nOld town is walkable and there are places to eat and drink in the area, there is also a general store directly across the street. Would definitely recommend if Syracuse is on your itinerary.","38494":"We spent a week at La Rosa sul Mare. The place has wonderful views. The colour of the sea is absolutely amazing. La rosa sul mare is not a hotel, so do not expect hotel service. The staff are pleasant and it was clean. You can eat in if you tell the staff in advance. Breakfast cost 10 Euros each. We had a great time most of the time until a group of Russians arrived. They were noisy, playing loud music at the beach and they didn't have any consideration for the other guests. Pity!","38505":"First of all, the photos on the booking sites DO NOT match the reality of the situation. The hotel is very poorly maintained and simply dirty. However, this is not where the trouble ends. We booked the Presidential Suite which at the time was marketed as a two bedroom, living room and kitchen apartment, this however, was not the case. The room consisted of kitchen\/living room, one bedroom and two beds on a corridor with no widows. To add on top of the subpar standard, the room was just not what we had paid for. After a very unpleasant conversation with the manager we managed to win back our money. We agreed to pay for one night, even though we did not stay there, and escaped the hotel!\nBottom line is: the hotel is not what it pretends to be online! Don't be fooled.","38526":"Not too sure whether this is a hotel or appartment as were given a room with a double &'single bed ( for 2 adults and a 15 year old), a shower room and a kitchen\/ living area.\nBeautiful location perched on rocks, every room\/ apartment has its own generous terrace.\nBut..... Room\/ apartment itself was a bit dark. Use of kitchen area charged at \u20ac10 per day ( seems strange). Car parking inside the hotel gate also charged at \u20ac10 per day resulting in an empty car park and people parking on rough ground across the road.\nAlthough there were three of us, the terrace was furnished with a table and TWO chairs. There are cameras everywhere which made us feel a bit like characters in The Truman Show (!) . Knowing I was being watched, I took a kitchen chair outside so we could each have a seat....within minutes, a third plastic garden chair arrived! No sunbeds were provided so we lay on concrete to sunbathe. After a few days of crippling backache, we asked for sunbeds but were brought TWO ( not 3) plastic recliners which were only marginally better than the chairs and certainly not helpful if you wanted to lie on your front!\nBathrooms have a bin supplied, which I appreciate when removing make up etc, however, the purpose of this one was to place all toilet paper after each visit to the loo...not the fault of the hotel of course but not terribly pleasant (although emptied daily) and something to consider.\nI can confirm that the wifi is only available within a couple of metres from the reception office...better than nothing but not ideal.\nThe location is superb and hard to beat..however it is in the middle of a residential area and a car is essential. There is one pizzeria nearby ( a short drive) also a small shop for basics and a Lidl supermarket on the way to Syracuse. Syracuse itself has an abundance of family-run restaurants serving simple, homely, tasty food.\nIn summary: beautiful location but I would strongly advise hiring a car.","38557":"Perfect hotel! Very nice location just nex to the see. There is a swimming pool with a wonderful view of the bay and a private rock beach with some longchairs at disposition.\nThe rooms are nice and big (there are like little appartments actually) and you can find everything you need. The staff was very helphul and friendly. The owner of the hotel Giuseppe is also very friendly and gave us some advices.\nWe could get a special price of 100 euro as we came in June and the hotel was empty.\nIn a word, it's a hotel where you can relax and disconnect totally.","38626":"Great place and great service - that's the summary of our brief visit to B & B Sognando Ortigia. There wasn't any problem that we declared to stay only for one night. Just the opposite, owner was very helpful and provided us information, brochures, maps and timetable of places of interest. The price was favorable considering service and the location of the B & B (just outside ruins of Apollo Temple - great view from balcony). Next time I'll visit Siracuse I'm definitely staying there!","38627":"We stayed here in April and had a great time! It's 10 minutes walk from the main tourist attractions and bars\/restaurants (Via Cavour has the best restaurants and bars and is only 5 mins walk away!). The place itself was nice (we had a 4 bed room) with enough space and a balcony too. It was clean also. There is a nice beach about 15 mins away by taxi - definitely worth a visit. But the icing on the cake for us was Alberto! He was an amazing host and gave us lots of tips and entertainment in our short stay there! Stay here just for him!! Your panda girls miss you Alberto! Ciao Ciao!","38629":"Excellent B&B, we felt most welcome! The owner speaks perfect English and is ever so pleasant to talk with. He is so passionate about his lovely city and has been very inspirational for us. We had a triple room - very spacious, with two lovely balconies overlooking the Apollo temple, stunning view! He had lots of light in the room, that was such a relief as most other places we stayed in Sicily were poorly lit. I could also sit in the sun and read while my husband and daughter were having an afternoon nap. There's a well-equipped communal kitchen which was very convenient for a family with a 3-year-old child. the location is very convenient as well - right at the start of Ortygia, close to the sea-front promenade. I would not think of staying anywhere else in Syracuse.","38633":"I highly recommend this B&B in Ortigia, Siracusa. I love the location: It is not only very central but also overlooking the vibrant daily open air market. You hear the murmurs of people enjoying their morning coffees and chatting as you wake up to another nice (and sunny!) morning in Siracusa. The B&B is very clean. The new owner (from October 2012 onwards) Alberto is very nice and helpful. He speaks very good English and sincerely cares for his guests. You get breakfast vouchers that are valid at the patisserie downstairs, which is a place buzzing with local people all day long. The food in the patisserie is delicious and the staff is very friendly. Right across the B&B is the Apollon temple and few really good restaurants are closeby. There is one private bathroom reserved for each room so it is much better than a standard B&B where you have to share bathrooms. I wanna go back to Siracusa and I won't look for another place to stay. This is just perfect.","38636":"The Residenza is in an unbeatable location, like a palace in the heart of the city. The space is very charming and confortable, with unique classic furniture pieces combined with modern elements. Alberto made our experience fabulous during our stay in Siracusa, very careful and attentive, an extraordinary host! The breakfast on the terrace by the patio was very placed and included even self-made cake. Very recomendable!","38637":"This small b&b is located in the magic Ortigia Island, 2 mins walking to the main square. Very well decorated, la Residenza del Reginale makes you feel home with the big living room where you can relax reading a book or just chill listening the amazing playlist the team put on everyday. The real queen of the structure is Anita who will take care of you with a delicious breakfast that you can join in the terrace. The rooms are big and include all the comfort with a mother design and decorations. Alberto, the owner of the place is the best tuoi rust guide you can find in the city, giving advice on touristic spots and restaurant.\n\nCannot wait to go back again soon!","38638":"The host is very kind and helpful. The accommodation is in the center, very close to everything. The rooms are clean and nice. Breakfast is perfect. I can only recommend.\nSyracuse is beautiful. The beach is a 2-minute walk away.","38655":"Located in the heart of Siracusa (above a restaurant so a little noisy overnight).\nVery hospitable\/ warm and friendly host.\nClean and comfortable accommodation.\nPleasant breakfast. Awesome chocolate croissants, average coffee.","38656":"Wonderful welcome, great room and well situated. Beautiful small hotel with lovely rooms and atmosphere. perfectly situated near shops, bars and restaurants. Owner very welcoming and a great local guide. We will definitely return to this little gem!","38658":"Location - great, in the centre of town\nFacilities - excellent, it had everything, very well kept and maintained, the room was stylist and modern.\nCleanliness - very clean and fresh.\nService - the owner Alberto was great, he helped me with the bus timetable and was attentive. His staff member Claudia could not speak english but it wasn\u2019t an issue for me, she was very helpful at attentive too.\nComfort - Thebed was very comfortable, the pillows could have been firmer but that me being picky.\nValue - I got a deal of the day and so made it value for for.\nOverall - 10\/10 - it delivered everything I look for me a hotel.","38687":"The location is great! It's within 10 minutes walk of the Talete parking (if you travel by car in Sicily) and it is in very close proximity of the Ortigia centre, right behind Piazza Archimede. The breakfast is also good","38717":"Stayed in room 113. This bedroom and bathroom were large and had a balcony(with a clothes line!); I think it was a triple. There is internet , phone and a refrig in the room. Looked exactly like photo's on website. It was a convent so its not luxuriously decorated and there is only 1 window per room so without adequate lighting it can be dark. There was a delightful breakfast on the roof with tables inside or under canopies outside. Cloth table clothes and a nice food selection. This area is a little worn but 5 minutes away from the bus and train stations. No English is spoken. My only issue is that the air conditioning and refrigerator were not cold enough for us and more lighting would be great..","38720":"I chose this on the Internet before coming to Italy. The description and pictures included were not a good representation of what we found. We arrived about 8 pm as our train was late. The neighborhood was so dark, desolated and grimy we weren\u2019t sure it was safe to walk. I was shocked when we saw the hotel as it looked nothing like the picture. My husband wanted to see the room before checking in and the owner seemed reluctant but did take him up. It was clean and we were tired from 10 hours of travel. We did venture out for dinner and were relieved to see lights and people after a couple of blocks.\n\nWe discussed what our next step should be and agreed we would pack up and check out first thing in the morning. I tried to search for rooms on the internet but WiFi wasn\u2019t working. I was finally able to get online about 9 in the morning. We were so dissatisfied we did not eat breakfast and headed toward Ortigia. We had a stroke of luck and found a room at our very first stop. Cost was the same but a world of difference in the two hotels and neighborhoods.\n\nWe would encourage anyone looking at this hotel to look elsewhere. They will be glad they did.","38725":"The rooms we were given were huge, with lovely unique touches incl. quaint wooden wardrobes, shutters and flooring, very clean and my friend was upgraded to a triple room, which were very spacious - plenty of room to spread out over 2 days. Nice bright bathroom\/shower and okay internet, enough for brief catch ups online. Lovely separate breakfast room with terrace, with someone serving coffee, and fantastic breakfast choice compared to other hotels on our trip (good fruit selection and even normal bread for toasting, not the packet Melba toast style!). Oddly in my room the safe was located in the fridge.. but it worked ok!\n\nMy room window fronted onto a busy street which was slightly noisy in the mornings from traffic, however didn't pose too much of an issue as we were up reasonably early to head out to explore. Location was perfectly central for everything, comfortable strolling distance to restaurants\/bars, shops and 5-10 mins walk to Ortigia island.\n\nThere was no lift so some lifting of heavy suitacases required up the stairs (on our arrival there was an older gentleman who we didn't want to bother, though on check out there was a younger guy) however the staircase is wide and steps not steep. Command of English by hotel staff was sporadic (not always great) however this was our general experience across Sicily outside of Palermo.\n\nParking directly outside the hotel on the street was a real bonus. The building itself is beautiful and full of character, something a bit different to your bulk standard hotel. Would certainly stay here again.","38742":"One one person spoke acceptable English, room was a large 'bulk' room with no admosphere.\nBreakfast was very simple, typical Italian I suppose, location of the breakfast was a 'plus': top-floor.\nLocation is a five minutes walk from the railway station and a fifteen minute walk to the beautiful city centre.","38788":"We stayed in this lovely apartment for 5 days. Our hostess Loredana is the best ever, she made us feel at home in her great apartment.The rooftop areas is a real bonus. Everything you need is nearby and if you need any help Loredana is willing to be of assistance. Apartment is close to swimming and in the centre of the old part of town. At end of our stay we asked her to organise a taxi to train station but she just took us there herself- great service. Highly recommend.","38818":"We booked out all 3 rooms for a family stay while visiting Ortigia for a wedding. I can not recommend La Dimora di Ulisses more highly. Salvo was super helpful in the booking process and very patient as we changed dates a few times. It is very conveniently located, right near il Duomo piazza but also with beautiful views over the marina & gorgeous sunsets. I can highly recommend this property.","38821":"Terrific welcome from our host .Everything explained so well .\nThe room was well appointed and a very good bathroom.Fresh towels each day and good linen.\nThe breakfast was first class and the best so far in Sicily .\nEasy walk into Ortigia with its gorgeous architecture and super market .\nWe enjoyed a boat tour and visiting the Papyrus museum .The Jewish bath though a very short visit was fascinating.\nThe recommendation from our host on restaurants was very useful.\nThankyou Giuseppe for the service and the chat .\n\nRoger and Sara Mitchell","38829":"Excellent staff. Very friendly and helpful. Valeria took the time to show us on the map all the best places to eat and to visit in town when we checked in.\nWe stayed in room #3. Very spacious with modern bathroom, powerful a\/c, small fridge and good WiFi connection. There are a total of 5 rooms- 3 rooms on the ground floor and a much larger room on the top floor with its own private terrace. While our room was on the same level as the breakfast room, the double doors separating the two areas helped to minimize the noise. There is free and safe street parking in front of the hotel. Breakfast was very good with a wide selection of fresh pastries, cheeses, fruits and drinks. The hotel is about a 15 minute walk from the historical town center.\nThis place gets a thumbs up especially if you\u2019re arriving in Siracusa in a car and do not want to worry about parking.","38833":"The reason we had chosen this place based on room description being 90 sq.m. with terrace and spa bath, free parking and location convenient for both, Ortygia old town and archeological zone.\nUpon arrival, we found the room to be about 15 sq.m. with large terrace with some patio furniture and whirlpool all covered with thick layer of dust.\nWe've been told that they experienced sand storm few days ago, but no explanations why it was not cleaned afterward.\nAlso, we've been told that we cannot use whirlpool\nWhen I show reservation confirmation clearly saying that the room equipped with spa bath, permission had been granted, but the water was too cold, jets not working and it never been fixed during our 3 days stay, so we ended up paying for something we cannot use.\nBesides, this terrace is being used by staff for drying laundry, so by no means it is \"private\"\nThere is no designated parking and street parking is difficult to find.\nAt one occasion we had spent almost 2 hours circling the entire City centre trying to find the spot.\nThere were no help offering.\nReception is not open 24 hours as advertised, but 3 telephone numbers are provided to contact in case of emergency.\nTwo of them did not answer at all, third one was a women who cannot speak English, she suggested to call 4-th number to another women who had said that she is out of town and cannot help. (the Owner later reply that I could park for a fee 700 meters from the property - nice solution)\nThe location is not very convenient - Ortygia is 25 min walk if you walk really fast, same for archeological sites. The problem is that area you are walking through is very unattractive, full of traffic and pollution.\nAll good places to eat are in Ortygia - nothing around the property, and since night walk is not recommended, one should allocate at least 12 Euros for taxi ride back home.\nIn summary, we are very disappointed with this property - room and bath are very small, bed uncomfortable, breakfast very basic - supermarket style (and if you are not the early eater, you'll be presented with limited choose of leftovers from other guests).\nOn a positive side place is clean, secure and breakfast staff is friendly.\nThis B & B is may be OK for one night stopover, but don't pay extra for terrace, like we did","38837":"We arrived here only for 2 days. The room impressed me because it looks much more better than on photos. The host is incredibly friendly, Valeria showed us good places with local foods, we tried couple of them and they all were perfect. The location is very good, everything is close. If we come back here, we know where we be spending days :) thank you!)","38843":"Contrary to the name this single room B&B was located in Ortigia. But the owner possess another B&B in Siracusa. Marco the owner was super friendly. He did spend nearly an hour with me to find a free parking about 800 meters away and to explain what to do in Ortigia and Siracusa giving some nice tips. The cozy room with airconditioner was recently renovated .There was housekeeping sevice every morning, even the refreshment of bottle of water in the refrigerator. There was a small ensuite kitchen,washing machine and iron in the room. The bathroom was nice. The wireless internet connection was good.","38881":"I suggest to go in residence ortigia because the apartment are really nice in two levels, really clean and they are in a nice court, really close to the sea and to the mother church and other things too see","38884":"I booked, because it was recommended to me by friends who came last year. I was very satisfied. All photos correspond to the site. Room very clean and equipped with all comfort.\nThen, it is located in the heart of the historic center\nRecommended","38886":"Unfortunately, the pictures do not match the reality. The room is not clean and needs maintenance. We reported immediately to the property manager that the room was dirty but the situation did not improve too much. The hairdryer exploded in our had and we risked to get injured. The property is in a small square where there is a pub so you can find people eating in front of your room. The Internet is slow, the supply of hot water is unstable and the shower does not work well. The bed is not conformable. For sure the price we paid does not match the quality we experienced.\n\nThe property is in a good location only 25 minutes by foot from the railways' station and at the centre of Ortigia island","38961":"We used a gps in our rental car to get to this location for our one night stay. I'm not sure it gave us the most direct, best route, but we certainly took a scenic route through lots of narrow streets in this adorable town! We found the assigned parking lot and walked to our place. A note about the parking lot. Just park your car there and you will get the ticket and pay when you leave. There's no ticket to get when you enter.\nThe host, Emanuel, showed up the same time we did! He showed us to our room and we settled in. He was very friendly and helpful. His English was pretty good!\nThe a\/c worked great! Thin windows\/walls because we could hear quite a bit around us. There were outlets on both sides of the bed which was nice. There was limited counter space in the bathroom but the the lighting was great. No place in the shower to put your shower supplies. The shower head was quite elaborate but I just used the basic spray. The temperature dial worked great though and so did the drain. As usual, not much room in the shower stall but at least the water stayed inside d\/t the sliding glass door. Community space had a mini fridge and a few chairs. There was a rooftop patio with table and chairs. Not much of a view but it was an outdoor space if you wanted one. We were given breakfast vouchers to a place that was a 6 minute walk. It was good for one pastry, one coffee and one orange juice. We then walked to the parking lot to get the car out. The first machine did not take our credit card so we drove to another machine in the lot. We input the vehicle license tag and it told us \u20ac15 and took our credit card. It gave us a ticket which we fed to the gate which let us out.","38964":"A short walk from the Talete parking station or if your lucky one if the few spots on the street (make sure they are the blue legal ones & not resident only spots). Also enter the island over the correct bridge to save being booked!!!\n\nOnce there Peppe will give you all the tips on the places to see\/do. The rooms are comfortable, serviced daily and it's quiet. Shower has all the outlets you could use!!!\n\nLocation is second to none (best hotel in area is literally 20m away) and 10 mins to walk anywhere to enjoy, food, drink, shops, swim, tours, etc\nAnd it's real value fotr money!!!\n\nBreakfast is provided at one of the restaurants at the Duomo 400m away, so a walk to eat!!!\nYou'll need at least 2 nights minimum to see what's around.\nOne of the picks of Sicily!!!","38968":"Big thank you to Maria, Peppe and Denise for making our stay so special. All three were so welcoming and helpful, we were really blown away. Beautiful building, fantastic location - close to everything but also tucked in a peaceful street. Ortigia is absolutely stunning - we will definitely be back and we definitely be staying at Charme Ares!","38969":"Great room. Large with balcony. Location is perfect, near Archimedes and shops\/restaurants and only a short walk from the car park. Very welcoming and the roof terrace was a real bonus. Nice to breakfast in the square as well. Perfect.","38987":"My adult daughter and I stayed here for 2 nights in late September. She had stayed there on a previous visit to Syracuse and liked the location and the owner. Room was comfortable and quiet, and while the breakfast was not offered on site, it was provided at a cafe on the piazza across from the cathedral. Wonderful! Enzo is welcoming and helpful. We visited just about every site he suggested.","38988":"Stayed for 3 nights at the end of September. Was welcomed by Enzo & his partner who gave us detailed information about Ortigia and very kindly booked a taxi to the bus station when we left. It was in a convenient location in one of the lovely small streets close to the centre as well as the sea. Our room was beautifully furnished & clean & situated at the front of the building which was generally quiet. We heard no noise from other residents either. The bathroom had an excellent shower though towels and sheets were not changed during our stay. Vouchers were given for an enjoyable breakfast at Cafe Grand opposite the duomo. It consisted of orange juice, 2 pastries of our choice and a hot drink. The walk there took about 10 minutes but worth it for the view. Would definitely recommend this b & b.","39017":"I am a senior adult experienced world traveler, picky but not overly so, who does much research before choosing a lodging and so am rarely disappointed.\nLOCATION: center of historic ortigia neighborhood of syracusa on historic quiet street near thew sea, all sites, and restaurants, shuttle bus to new town and bus\/train stations and new town sites\nBUILDING: one floor of large historic home\nTYPE: central large historic lovely lobby\/reception to hang out in\nCLEANLINESS: spotless\nPERSONNEL\/HOST: incredibly friendly & helpful english speaking host who is a fount\/encyclopedia of knowledge on Syracusa past and also present, who will take you on a guided walking tour free and give you all conceivable info on what to see & how to see it. amazing fellow.\nROOM: very atmospheric historic room modernized\nBATH: nice big bath, not euro-tiny\nVIEW: street\nBREAKFAST: you are given a chit for a hot beverage and TWO pastries at one of two local cafes, which turns out to be a really nice experience, as they both are lovely and welcoming & a nice way to begin the day with the locals.\nNOISE: very quiet inside & from the street.\nCOMFORT: comfortable beds, room, & lobby\nPUBLIC COMPUTER\/WIFI:wifi & free public computer at large desk in lobby\nSUM-UP: the absolute ideal host - so full of info & so pleased to share it with guests. take the time to spend time with him chatting (and touring)","39049":"I stayed in this Bed and Breakfast for 2 nights in October during a road tour of Sicily with two childhood friends. We had three separate rooms each with all the amenities we needed; good bedding, a bathroom, television and free Wifi. The B&B is well located in a safe neighbourhood, with several places to have breakfast and quiet at night. The guy at the reception desk was very friendly. What more could you want ?\nThe only downside of our stay was that part of the roof of a private apartment on the upper floors of the building came down on several parked cars and our rental car was one of them. Fortunately no one got hurt. B&B Ciclamino was in no way to blame for the damage but it just goes to show that you have to be careful where you park your car !","39108":"Convenient and central location on Ortigia.\n\nVery modern and tastefully decorated - both our room and the common breakfast\/dining area.\n\nOur room had a balcony that overlooked the courtyard which was nice to relax on at the end of the day.\n\nVery comfortable bed.\n\nBreakfast was delicious. Homemade pastries were a nice touch.\n\nOur host was friendly and attentive. He made a number of excellent restaurant and sight seeing recommendations.\n\nHighly recommend.","39109":"This is a modern, crisp, fresh, friendly B&B ideally located in Ortigia. The contemporary decor is somewhat surprising given the traditional outside appearance of and entrance to the building....an interesting contrast of old and new. The rooms are well designed and comfortable. Breakfast was satisfying. The host, Nino, was warm and welcoming. One small suggestion is to make available a second set of keys for guests who need it. Overall, a very pleasant and recommendable place to stay in old Ortigia.","39176":"We stayed here one night. The room was tiny and not well cleaned. In fact the shower looked gross. The bed was not very comfy. The staff, although nice, do not help you with your luggage so you end up having to cart your luggage up and down the stairs. No elevator was offered us. The breakfast was mediocre. We would not stay here ever again.","39190":"Lovely hotel. Big room on ground floor. Nice and clean. Friendly and helpful staff. We went out of season and think we were the only ones staying. There was a lot of work being completed in the grounds and around the pool so we didn't feel we could sit out there. The breakfast was good with lots to choose from. The only downside was the wifi which was so slow we turned it off and used mobile data instead. You will need a hire car to get around from this hotel as it is pretty isolated.","39192":"Lovely rooms and gardens but found barking dogs and late night music from hosted parties past midnight a real nuisance with staff nowhere to be seen. Avoid the hotel restaurant and suggest you save your palate for the great food you would get in central Ortigia. Wifi was very inconsistent.","39197":"Positive\n\nThis hotel is in beautiful surroundings and is clean and fresh. The staff are lovely and very attentive. Breakfast was standard continental (nothing to write home about) but all food was nice and fresh. Our room had french doors which led onto the back garden which was really nice. Rooms were cleaned very well daily and we also had a endless supply of clean towels. Pool area is my favorite thing about this hotel, great size pool and the seating areas were comfortable and clean. The restaurant menu hasn't got much options for kids but the pizza and chips we did order was lovely (you just don't want to eat that every day)\n\nNegative\n\nAlthough the room was lovely it was smaller than expected for a 3 person stay\nTV was tiny and to the horror of the kids there are no English channels available at all.\nWiFi offered is terrible which was heavily relied upon due to not having any English channels available. (we were out during the day but early mornings and nights was when it really effected us). My advice come prepared with DVD's\/Laptop and Books.\nThis is a small thing but think it should be addressed - The sheets on the bed felt very starchy (although very clean), I think more conditioner is needed when washing them).\nThe last slight negative is the lunch options, this is minimal and not the greatest quality, there are no restaurants near except a popular beach (mariella) but the food there is beyond expensive -\n\nOverview\n\nWe had a good time at Fanusa and I would stay there again. This is defiantly a place where a car is needed to get the best experience but if you're looking for somewhere to relax this place is it!! I would not suggest this as a small child friendly hotel as there's nothing to do here but chill and swim (and there's not much to do with kids in the surrounding areas).\n\nWith some fine tuning I think this place definitely has what it takes to be a 4 or 5 star establishment.","39207":"The hotel is a boutique hotel and is very nice .it's in a lovely setting with a lovely pool.the staff mostly are helpful and friendly.\n\nSadly that's the end of the good bits.\n\nThw breakfast is poor.almost a snack bar breakfast.\n\nHowever the worst part of the hotel is the restaurant.Very slow (hour and a half)and abrupt rude staff.\nfood served was undercooked which was a surprise as it was only pasta .something we thought easy to cook and Italian .\nSorry to say the worst restaurant we have been to.\nthe chef can't cook.\nthere were other issues but the best advise I can give is avoid.","39232":"Gli odori ed i paessagi della bella Siracusa passando per il Bnb di Giuliana. As sicilian on holidays here for the first time, we highly recommend you this lovely place in the heart of Syracuse. It really reflect the essence of our beautiful land. Grazie Giuliana per la tua diponibilita':","39243":"Fabulous hosts who were so friendly and accommodating. We were welcomed with some fresh drinks and some nuts, they made recommendations on local places to visit, and the breakfast spread was out of this world, majority of which was home made!\n\nThe location is maybe 10 minutes outside of Syracuse, very clean and spacious.\n\nWould recommend for a family stay.","39246":"We were welcomed with a drink which was much appreciated as we had been walking in the countryside around Mount Etna all day. The accommodation was spacious and comfortable and the breakfast was excellent. We were given helpful advice to find our way around the local area.\nGood locat for visiting:\nSyracuse Archaeological Park\nNoto\nVilla Romana del Contrada Casale in Piazza Armenia.\nOur hosts were wonderful. One evening we had a break down in the rental car and they came out to help us and arranged for the car to be towed back to the hotel. The next morning they came with us to the garage to make sure the car was mended so we could continue our holiday. We really appreciated their kindness and generosity.","39283":"I spent 1 night there with my wife in June 2014.\nThe B&B is 10 minutes out of Zurich (by car). It looks quite old, our room was quite big and clean but with oldish furniture. In general very noise being the room on the road and the windows not really sound proof. The breakfast was ok.\nVery high rate to the owners, they are very nice and helpful, with their effort they compensate some lacks in the B&B.\nAll in all I would suggest to look for another solution closer to Siracusa but in lack of an alternative this could be a good compromise.\n! night 60\u20ac, 50 would have been fairer.","39378":"I stayed for two nights last week with a group of university students. Location is great, and rooms, though plain and simple, are charming. Wi-Fi not great, but that\u2019s no surprise. Breakfast was unexciting\u2014how about some fruit? But the one area that really needs work is the most basic: staff should be friendly and helpful but they\u2019re not either. When I asked for dolcificante for my coffee, she shrugged and said they were out; the next day when I asked again, she shrugged and said it was not her responsibility. Second: there was no supplemental toilet paper provided on the second night even when what remained wasn\u2019t adequate. But there is no one around to assist in the evening; and when I requested a new roll the next morning, the staff person was annoyed that I expected her to provide it immediately.\nThis place needs friendly and helpful staff!","39380":"Nice, clean family run hotel in Ortigia. Room was clean and spacious. Friendly host who pointed out the main attractions on a map during check in. Good location with loads of restaurants, cafes and shops nearby. There is a daily morning market nearby. Covered car park at the northern end of Ortigia is close by.","39460":"I have mixed views about this hotel. It's in a good position for Ortega, reasonable cost and there's even free parking on a street behind the hotel.\nDon't expect luxury, a warm welcome or any frills, just treat it as a place to sleep that's quiet and with a comfortable bed.\nWe had room 23. It was a good size, simply furnished, had air conditioning, a fridge, safe and tv. There was even a very small balcony, but the \"sea view\" was glimpse of water beyond an office building. The shower in the en-suite was very weak. The bedroom was up 2 flights of steep stairs, there is a strange lift that will transport your luggage, but not you.\nThe staff was rather sullen on the whole, there was one reasonably helpful young lady.\nBreakfast was pretty poor, but provided a few calories to get you through the morning's sight seeing in Syracuse.\nBut having said all this, Mediterraneo is a good base for exploring Syracuse. Ortega is an easy walk. The Hoppa Bus stops just down the road and this will take you to the more distant sights. There are many restaurants and bars close by.","39462":"Booked a triple room with balcony online, but got a \"double\" and \"without balcony.\" When pressed and pressured, another room was finally and reluctantly shown - the proper triple with a balcony - but the toilet in that room did not flush and the fridge was dirty. Besides, the hot water was going to take more than 1 hour to get heated for the new room, so I capitulated (after a 40-hour airplane hopping) and stayed in the double room.\n\nWifi was sporadic at best. And, of course, they tried to refuse credit card payment. The worst, however, was the TOTAL LACK OF ENGLISH and CARE. Mr. Morelli, who was in charge of manning the front desk, did not even understand \"check out.\" Don't bother ask him anything because all he could say was \"Io non lo so (I don't know).\" He would not help you planning your trip because even with the aide of Google translate, he would still only repeat \"Io non lo so\" to everything.\n\nHowever, the only time Mr. Morelli was active and even aggressive in communication was when he wanted to know when you would leave and when you would return because he would have to be at the hotel to open the door and get the keys. Excuse me, so I cannot come and go as I please? But I am a tourist, how do I know when I will come back or leave?\n\nSo, if you want to ENJOY and HAVE A VACATION, stay away from this place.","39557":"Very good location for car travellers. Little bit far from Ortiga if You want walk or have less time. Nice view from window. Very, very friendly host. Spacious bedroom and nice bathroom, clean, comphortable.","39599":"This is the type of hole-in-the-wall apartment, typical for the old town ghettos of Sicily. After a night or two you'll notice that it's located in the dirtiest area of Ortygia. You'll have no window in the only room and will have to open the front door to get some fresh air (forget about privacy), but still NO chance to get rid of the humidity and strong smell of the place. The two never-walked-out pitbulls living at the balcony right above, will keep pissing just in front of your bathroom, making the smell even worse. Neighbors playing loud disco hits (\"nossa nossa\") all the time. Owner Delia, who was at first very friendly and spoke decent English, suddenly went like \"Sorry me no English\" when it came to helping us with those problems. A week later she remembered her English again, to inform us that she was not responsible for our problems, to accuse us of being immigrant-haters for having shared our opinion of the area and finally to describe our call for 50% money refund as a normal compensation for such a bad tourist experience and an obvious overprice as blackmail. LOL. It could be funny if it hadn't completely ruined our Sicily vacation. This is a VERY VERY LOW VALUE, not worth 50EUR at all, as for this price you can get a really nice B&B on the island, including room cleaning, breakfast and decent staff.","39600":"We had our honey moon in Italy for 15 days. We most recommend this hotel because it's very convenient and comfortable and pretty and beautiful. The owner of the hotel Delia is a very nice girl, she even took us to the temples by her car. If you have enough time, you could cook in your room. Anyway, Syracuse is a great place and the ll Rosone either!!!","39667":"This place is on a lovely alleys\nStaff are multilingual and very helpful\nVery clean quaint but modern\nBig comfy bed\nClean modern en suite bathroom\nWe feel we really lucked out great price point\nSome difficult stairs noted but overall quiet\nGood air con and tv","39736":"The bridge to Ortigia is possibly a 10 min walk from the B&B Nike and Ortigia is absolutely wonderful. The B&B is also located within walking distance of the bus station (we took the bus from Catania and onwards to Palermo). The archeological park (also highly recommended) is a 30 to 40 min walk. The room and bathroom were roomy, spotless and comfortable. Vittoria and Angelo were both helpful and personable. While the B&B is located a few floors up there is a lift for the suitcases which certainly is helpful for us older folk!","39748":"Its location is close by walk to the Ortigia island. Rooms and bathrooms are confortable and big. Service is fine.\nIn fact it can be called a pension operated by a family rather than a hotel. The only disadvantage is that there is no lift and the pension is at the upper floor. The bags are carried up in a container by an interesting chain hoist system.","39765":"The rooms were big and clean. Fridge and hairdryer were also in the room.\n\nThe host Angelo is lovely and is passionate about the coffee and the produce selected for his guests. The breakfast was nice, was a range of cheeses, meats and pastries etc. Note, like the other reviews, he speaks French or Italian and a little English.\n\nTravelling with a 3 year old boy, the stairs to the 2nd floor was not an issue, although we did have to do two rounds to get our luggage in. The walk to Ortigia is nice and reasonably close. For dinner and night time Ortigia old town is the place to be, it's lively with lots of locals out for dinner in the summer night.\n\nIf I were to be back in this area, I will certainly stay here again.","39766":"If we had read the details of this B&B before arriving in Syracuse by satnav we would not have been expecting a big sign. Our mistake! The B&B is situated in a block of apartments and the actual sign is next to the door entry intercom. The entrance within the building is on the second floor so beware if you have heavy cases, there is no lift. The room we had was OK and had a tiny balcony overlooking the internal yard area. It was just about adequate to sit out on but on one side there was a big box on the wall which was just at the right height to crack you head on whilst seated, which I did. The room itself was a good size as was the bathroom and shower. If I was being critical I would suggest it needs an update. It's well situated for walking to Ortigia which has some nice areas. Syracuse itself is quite rundown. Be aware that the hop on\/hop off bus is a joke. We got on at the bus stop near the harbour, got off at the Greek theatre area. When the small but full tour bus arrived we stood back to let people off, only 2 got off whereupon others who had pushed to the front got on leaving the rest of us stranded. They only have one bus so we would have to wait for it coming around again in 1 hour. Who knows, it may have been full again so we got a taxi back to town. Very poor, they need additional buses.","39813":"Stayed in the Diana B+B annex at Via Cavour 32\nPro's.\nGreat room and excellent breakfast in room although 30 minutes later than time booked which upset travel arrangements.\nCon's.\nOn-site parking advertised and an important factor in our booking decision. Parking was 250 metres distant which meant dragging luggage back up hill to the property.\nNo signage whatsoever at the property and no on-site staffing.\nPhoned and waited in street for 40 minutes for a person to show up to check us in and then had to wait further as she checked in other guests who arrived just as we were about to be taken to the parking facilities.\nGood property spoiled by lack of attention to basic details.","39815":"The hotel was in the most wonderful location right in the middle of the old town, over looking the Archimedes Piazza. The room was clean and spacious and the breakfast brought to our room each morning on a trolley from a menu that we chose the night before was a really nice touch. We couldn't have asked for a better location to explore the town. The room had a comfy bed and sofa as well as a balcony overlooking the Piazza, where there was a good selection of Cafes and eating places.\nThere is not much parking, however we were offered a garage for the car which is a 5 minute walk away for 15 Euros a night which was reasonable, or you can park for 10 euros in the main open car park which is about 15 minutes away. The hotel is on a one way system through the old town so if you are arriving by car it can take some finding.\nI would highly recommend this hotel.","39818":"Perfect location, incredibly clean, simple yet tasteful rooms and most amazing breakfast and service... best 3 stars we stayed in during our 2 weeks trip by far. I would come back any time and can only recommend this B&B.","39821":"The location of the B&B is excellent. It is centrally located with public transport just across the street. It is a lovely short walk to all main sites with plenty of coffee shops and restaurants at your disposal. The rooms have all necessary amenities and are kept super clean. A very nice breakfast is served in the comfort of your room. Both owner and staff are very helpful and sociable. Surely it is value for money.","39822":"-Great location, few minutes walking from P.zza Duomo\n-Very comfortable beds\n-Massive breakfast\n-Spacious room and nice bathroom\n-Great value for money.\nRossella and Erika were very helpful.\nThank you very much.","39829":"B&B Diana is perfect if you want to be in the center and enjoy the local life there !\nThe view on Piazza Archim\u00e8de is beautiful. We thought the place would be a little bit noisy because the rooms are located on Piazza Archim\u00e8de Place, but it's was not.\nThe rooms are very spacious : we had a room and a living room appart !\nThe breakfast was very good and very substantial : you can choose what you want on a list, and your breakfast is served in the room.\nI recommand this place !","39863":"If you stay at B&B Diana, you're within walking distance of just about everywhere in Ortigia (Siracusa's historic center). That alone might recommend this place, but there's more: our host was non-interfering and flexible (although largely absent; that wasn't a problem for us, as we liked being left to our own devices, but perhaps other tourists might want more guidance); the small room was charming, with a large window overlooking Piazza Archimede, and the house's central staircase is under a stone ceiling that just felt special every time we descended and opened the heavy door into the piazza. The complimentary breakfast in the cafe downstairs is pedestrian: don't bother.","39909":"lasciamo con grande piacere una recensione positiva per questa struttura situata in ottima posizione e in uno dei piu' bei contesti che la zona offre, al riparo da movide o frastuoni di ogni genere.\nIl valore aggiunto e' rappresentato dal fattore umano di cui Vincenzo, Adriana e Barbara sono i protagonisti assoluti.\nNon trascurabile anche il fattore \"animale\" certamente degno dei proprietari.\n\nUn saluto.\nFranco, Sandra, Laura e.... Jago!!!\n\nwith great pleasure we leave a positive review\/feedback for this property which features an excellent position in one of the most beautiful contexts that the area offers, away from the nightlife or any kind of noises.\nThe added value is represented by the human factor for which Vincenzo, Adriana and Barbara are the absolute protagonists.\nNot too negligible the \"animal\" factor certainly worthy of the owners.\n\nA greeting.\nFranco, Sandra, Laura and ........Jago!!!","39939":"We were the only guests. The pool didn't have clear water. No wifi no television. The stuff in the kitchen looked dirty and not fit for use.\n\nAlthough it looks good and the owner is nice, it just doesn't feel as a holiday.\n\nWe left after the first day, although we booked for more nights.","39943":"We stayed at Borgo Marino for a week at the beginning of June and everything was perfect! The location of the resort is amazing, in a very short time you can reach Ortigia or go to the crystalline water beaches or go and visit Noto and Modica and Ragusa... you'll have plenty of choices! It's like having every day a different holiday...The resort has a beautiful \"tropical\" garden where you can pick up yourself the lemons from the tree or smell their perfume from the swimmig pool overlooking the sea. Not to mention the hospitality: Vincenzo and Adriana will give you all the advice you need to make your stay unforgettable. Truly recommended!","39952":"the only good things to say - it is very convenient to the train station and the man at reception was welcoming and allowed us to check in around 10am since we had taken the 7am bus from Noto.\n\nBreakfast was coffee, yogurts and croissants, nicely prepared\n\nRoom was decent size, but basically not in great condition; it was old and probably hadn't been renovated in 20 years (??). Only two light bulbs were working in the room (of the other two , one was missing and the other burned out) making the room very dark. At least the air conditioner worked.\n\nThe bathroom was horrible \u2013 mold and water stains in the shower; if you didn\u2019t sit fully on the seat, the seat starts to slide off of the toilet !! I think chunks of the faucet cracked off while washing our hands ! Plastic cups in the room for use were wet and without protective plastic. Bed frame was dirty and rusty. Other than a great location for the train (right across the piazza), it was not a nice place to stay at all.","39962":"Nice and easy to find, breakfast basic and boring, lady on reception very helpful when we arrived giving us details of where everything was, nice and clean.\n\nShame about the noise from the road. Couldn't really hear the trains as hotel right opposite the train station but you could hear the noise from vehicles on the road.","39963":"Opposite the train station around the corner from bus station. Ten minute walk from old town.\n\nSpacious although old room. Smell in the bathroom. No lift. Very basic breakfast. Staff at reception was ok.","39970":"Come out the railway station, it's facing you. Also just round corner from inter-city bus stands. Friendly helpful multilingual welcome. Small but clean & comfy, very low room rate so it was 3-star quality for 2-star prices.\n\nMain tourist sights are Ortigia 1 km SE and Neapolis 1 km N, so 15 mins walk.","39971":"Location is the key here-directly opposite the railway station & round the corner from the bus station- Provides easy access to places such as Ragusa & Noto.\nThe room had recently been refurbished in typical Italian style .The hotel was very clean & comfortable & also had A.C. in room.\nBreakfast was OK & staff were friendly & spoke English. Overall, fantastic value!","40024":"As many others have indicated the location could not be better. It is great place to start exploring the many things Ortigia has to offer. It is easy to walk to all the main sites and wonderful restaurants on offer. The rooms are large and airy and air-conditioned. Stefano and his wife could not be more helpful and welcoming. They will park your car if you have one in safety close by, and offer a good breakfast to start the day. The cost is modest and thus the whole package adds up to an excellent choice.","40025":"The location couldn't be better, right on the square. Since parking anywhere in Syracuse is a problem, the desk clerk Domenica was fantastic, driving along with us to the nearby underground garage. Not sure if we could have found it without her. The room and bed were fine. Breakfast was very good (including hot bacon). However, there were a few issues (all eventually resolved).\n\nWe purposely booked a triple room based on the description - larger than standard room with balcony. As we checked in we were told that since we were only a couple, we were being placed in a ground floor double (literally accessed off the alley) at a discount (actually 4 euros more than our orginal quote). We rejected that, and were then taken to a standard double, with balcony, but smaller than the room we booked. Again we rejected that. Finally, after much discussion with the manager, we were taken to a actual triple, but without a balcony. We were also asked to cancel our booking.com reservation, and receive a 10 euro discount, which actually happened to us three times on our trip to Sicily. All in all, the room was fine, but this was a hassle.\n\nThe next issue was wifi. That took several hours to fix, but eventually was resolved and worked fine.\n\nAlthough the air conditioner turned on, the unit did not blow cold air. After a hot night, we notified the management, and the unit was fixed by time we got back to the room in the afternoon. Apparently, it was not yet in \"summer mode.\"\n\nFinally, when taking a shower before dinner the second night, the hot water ran out. We attributed that to high use throughout the building. Unfortunatley, the next morning there was no hot water. We mentioned that to the manager at breakfast, but by then we were packed an on our way out.\n\nAll in all, the management tried hard to make our stay pleasant, and for that I give them much credit.","40037":"We tried to enter this art of the city with our Tom Tom and almost got there but did not dare cruising through the small last shoppingstreet with a lot of people walking up and down. So we phoned and within 5 minutes help was there. Via a nice detour we crossed the impressive central square and entered the gate.\n\nThe place is perfect in the centre next to the cathedral and other beautiful buildings in the old capital of Sicili.\n\nYou feel welcome the moment you enter this B&B until the very moment you have to leave going on.\n\nWe got great support after a small personal accident..\n\nWe thank the staff and ofcourse Stefano!","40038":"Lucky for us our first hotel didn't work out for us and we found this gem of a B & B. It is located right in the most beautiful square with the most wonderful architecture. We had a clean quiet room and the most comfortable bed. Paolo met us to help us park the car on the premises and was so helpful. Breakfast is across from the hotel at a cafe overlooking the cathedral. It was wonderful.","40039":"The B&B sits in the Piazza Duomo - very good location. We went there with our 6 month old baby, though the first day there wasn't a baby cot, the owner of the B&B got us a very nice baby cot the second day!\n\nThe room itself was also spacious and has good facilities! It is also very convenient that there is a Gelato shop underneath the B&B! :)","40040":"The room was spotlessly clean and spacious, very quiet although right next door to the cathedral and the main piazza. It was a treat to have breakfast sat outside the cafe in the piazza. The owner was very helpful - going as far as coming to find us when we got lost in the car and driving us to the hotel. All in all a fantastic find and would definitely come back.","40044":"We couldn't believe the location when we found this very reasonably priced hotel in Siracuse. We arrived by coach from the airport in Catania and got a quick taxi straight to the hotel. We would recommend coach to get around Sicily, air conditioning and very good value. The Cuomo square with its stunning cathedrals is just spectacular, clean, not too busy, with some of the most beautiful are architecture in Europe. The hotel is almost next door to the Duomo cathedral. Reception is on the first floor with no lift so be prepared to carry luggage. Reception staff are very helpful with little English so as we experienced across Sicily with friendliness and patience we could communicate (since we have no Italian). Our room was very clean, spacious with an end suite shower room, and a much-loved Juliet balcony that opened onto the square below. This was particularly beautiful in the morning before the locals and visitors arrive. The hotel is close to very interesting tourist attractions, cathedrals, museums, art galleries shops and many, many wonderful restaurants. Breakfast is across the square in a lovely cafe, a limited breakfast is available, but was very good. A point to note is that the hotel only takes cash, no cards, something that would be useful to know in advance. It just felt so special to know we were living in one of the most beautiful locations in Europe.","40045":"LOCATION, LOCATION, BIG TIME. The place was so clean and the people running it were just great. We are a family of 5 and the family room was massive. We will be back ...THE BEST ***** A place that must be seen and stay. John and Catena from Fremantle Western Australia","40095":"We stayed one week in Arenella at La Via Del Mare and loved every moment!\nBeautiful, cool rooms with comfortable beds and crisp bed linen and towels.\nThe B&B is set in a beautiful mature garden with cosy little quiet areas for sitting in the shade. Breakfast is served outside on a cool, shaded porch, with a wonderful selection of Sicilian pistachio and ricotta dolce bread rolls and fresh coffee.\nMaria was full of good advice and tips for day excursions and showed us some wonderful rocky and secluded beaches, along with great recommendations for restaurants.\nBountiful places to visit in the area, Siracusa, Noto, Ognina, Modica and Scicli. We will definitely be back! :)","40123":"Thank you!!! for wonderful relaxing holiday with elio and maria..who were kind to show us around syracusa and palazzolo and took care of us,the breakfast was served with fresh homemade biological traditional Sicilian food,beautiful place surrounded by sunshine and colours ..the room was disposed with every comfort thank you elio and maria for making our holidays very special we hope to come back next year!","40150":"We want to recommend this lovely bed & breakfast mainly because of the extremely friendly and helpful owners Maria and Helio who made us feel so much at home. the place is spacious and pleasant. It is in a walking distance from a beautiful beach and a fifteen min drive from the center of Syracuse. The breakfast we were given was much better than anything else we encountered during our visit in Sicily and Helio who is a chef prepared us an excellent diner. We will gladly come again to stay.","40151":"This a B&B, but this is a very good Bed and a VERY good Breakfast .\n\nLocation: a nice quiet and peaceful place, no big hotels and noisy discotheques around, mainly private villas. Quite close to the beach (sand, very clear water); about 4-5 min walk to one free beach, and slightly more (less than 10 min) to the other that borders a paid beach where you can get (without paying for the entrance) coffee, drinks, food or take a fresh-water shower, or use other facilities. Another 200 meters, and you can dive from the rocks with a lot of underwater wild life. On weekends during the high season it may become crowded at the free beach and it may be a good idea to pay for a deck chair under umbrella. 10-12 min drive to Syracusa (Syracuse) with its great history - (and fish restaurants), and also several small baroque towns around, like Noto, within 30-60 min of driving, where you can see the architecture and spend an evening in a nice cosy local restaurant.\n\nThe rooms at B&B are spacious, high ceilings, pleasant non standard furniture, and a lot of extra space, you do not feel yourself in a box, as it often is in the hotels. Very clean. Bed is comfortable. All the equipment (bathroom, air-condition) is new and works flawlessly. The room service is just excellent, everything is cleaned daily at the time of your convenience. There are two kitchens at the backyard for your convenience, and a grocery shopping place near by (walking distance) with anything you may need (bread, cheese, olives, prosciutto, pizzas, etc. as well as wine and beer) for a simple cosy supper at the veranda right outside your door facing a lovely garden.\n\nThe hosts are a very nice couple, very different personalities. Maria \u2013 a business woman \u2013 very cheerful and active, Elio \u2013 a former freelance scuba diver\/fish hunter, then a chef in London Italian restaurants for many years, \u2013 is more philosophical. Both speak English, and both are warm-hearted people who immediately make you feel as a visiting friend, rather than a customer. They will do anything for your comfort and convenience, and you are provided with many small but important extras \u2013 a cappuccino or espresso from a coffee machine at the kitchen any time, beach towels if you need, checking your e-mails at the Internet etc. \u2013 so you feel like at home. Plus, of course, useful advice about anything you need around. As Elio is an excellent cook, it may be a good idea to visit together in the morning a fish-market in Syracusa, buy some sea-foods \u2013 fish, squids, octopus (and some very good and cheap local wine) - and let Elio cook it for a nice dinner to share it with Elio and Maria.\n\nBreakfast deserves some special words. You can choose any type of the breakfast with Elio, but we would recommend sweet Sicilian breakfast. Be sure, Elio will find for you the best Sicilian sweets and you will be served a really delicious and lavish (a bit more than you can eat) breakfast with several kinds of brioches or croissants (Elio will notice what you like most and will keep to it), fantastic bread with homemade orange jam, freshly squeezed orange juice from the garden oranges, and plenty of fresh fruits. You will enjoy it , and will feel nostalgic for it afterwards!\n\nAltogether, a very nice experience.","40153":"Brilliant time. Maria and Elio our hosts couldn't do enough for us and were friendly and helpful. The rooms were clean and comfortable and breakfast on the veranda was the speciality of the host. Walking distance from the wonderful beach and sea. Quiet house, set back from the road. Guests all made to feel at home in this guest house in pretty Arenella, just a few miles from Siracusa.","40156":"A B&B that is ideally situated just 5 minutes on foot from the nice (Aranella) beach with crystal clear water. Maria and Elio welcome you as if you are a part of their family (both speak English) and give a wealth of useful suggestions... ranging from eateries one should visit (Elio is a chef and knows where to get the really great food) to beautiful places once can visit. Maria took us even on a spectacular trip to Palazzollo where we visited the procession of a local saint with lots of fireworks. The rooms are spacious, clean and the beds comfortable. Apart all this Maria prepares a great breakfast with homemade jam and a lot of fresh fruits. This prepares you to face the day that awaits you in Syracuse. There is also a small supermarket just a minute away in case you'd need to buy anything. We recommend this B&B to all those interested in visiting Syracuse and the surrounding area (Noto, Palazzollo etc.) since the price and quality offered is just great (free parking, internet). To get into Syracuse city centre we recommend a car since it is a 10min drive away. We had a really great time here with lovely hosts!","40160":"very nice B&B, close to the beautiful Arenella beach. Lovely quiet garden where you can enjoy delicious home-made breakfasts. Very nice and very helpful hosts, a real pleasure to spend some time here!","40190":"We ended up at this hotel for three nights after our AirBnb in Ortygia turned out to be a fraud - we booked this hotel on hotels.com as we were desperate for a place to stay with our child late in the day. We had very mixed feelings about this hotel. At first we were put off by the smell in our room - like a combo of pee and harsh cleaning products - we were shown a different room and it smelled worse - like cigarette smoke. One of the a\/c units in our first room did not work well. The hotel is a bit worn but it grew on us. The grounds are nice and well kept. The pool is wonderful and our nine year old daughter spent hours in it. It does have a children's shallow area. We were always able to get chairs in the shade. The breakfast was good - it had fresh fruit. We had dinner once at the restaurant and it was good. There was a private party going on while we were there and in our first room we were right across from the restaurant but we did not hear a peep. On our second day we moved to a different room and had a nice view of the grounds and it did not smell and the a\/c units worked very well. My husband was sleeping on the pull out sofa bed which was not too comfortable but the hotel staff came and used our closet doors to make the bed super comfortable. The hotel is clean and the staff are very nice. The man at the front desk was very friendly, helpful and really went out of way on several occasions to help us with various concerns. In the end we enjoyed our stay at this hotel. We slept really well here. I was able to seperate the two beds in the bedroom to make two twins which worked better for our family but one can also still use it as on larger bed. We were able to drive to the old town of Ortygia in about 15 minutes and find parking which was nice. We did feel that the hotel was way overpriced for what you get. The rooms are not fancy and are a bit worn but clean and comfortable. There is a small mini kitchen in the apartments but there is no oven and no plates, cups or sliverware is provided. The cupboards are bare. We did not ask about the cost to rent these items. So after our initial disappointment we were happy with our stay here just not the cost of it.","40192":"Beautiful place but I strongly recommend you check first if there are any private parties planned during your journey because it can turn your stay into nighmare. Not really a quiet place to rest with young children.","40205":"When there are no festivitiesy foreseen in this hotel the place is very quite. The access to the beach is easy however the beach itself has not a lot of space to stay outside the water.\n\nThe hotel itself is certainly overrated as a four star hotel but can be considered as an excellent two to three star facility.","40231":"Wonderful position with the Valley of the Temple view and beautiful view of the Mediterranean sea. Thanks to Christian and his Mother and Father to allow us to feel many Sicilian wonderful things. 1st the famous and real hospitality of Sicilians. 2nd, the fact that their house is not a house but a museum with ancient collection of painting, furniture and others, you feel to be in the museum. The bedroom has a throne bed and I felt to be a queen. Also, the food are highly selected, all natural, biological, for example, they served one type of jam that the university of Agrigento have recreated from the ancient fruit found at Acropoli. Each food that they served has a specific story. Also, for this reason, it is a museum. Thank you again for the wonderful experience.","40280":"We stayed in Siracusa for a single nightand booked our room in Trlskeles the same morning - online.\nThe exterior of the building is not promising and its area may look unsafe; however we walked in the night to reach Ortigia and get back (only some 15 minutes away) with no problem.\nOur room was big, clean and very comfortable, the ensuite clean and fully working. Because we were lazy we didn't get to try the breakfast.","40304":"I really do not understand why this place has such a good rating. We fell for it and were really dissatisfied. The place is built quite recently, bet the details just kill all good impressions.\n\nWe got a room on the first floor. It was very dark, as the windows of the first floor are very small. The lightning in the room is almost non existent, so I could hardly put any make up on. The room smelled of damp, so do the bed sheets. The towels are very old and worn out. The breakfast is served on plastic plates and with plastic knifes and forks.\n\nAfter two nights I was very happy to get out of there.","40412":"This small, but very welcoming B&B in the centre of Ortigia, the old city of Siracusa, is good value, clean and full of character. Anacleto the proprietor is an excellent host and will help you make the most of your stay in this most historic of Sicilian cities. Magnolia B&B is hidden away in the back streets, but it is nevertheless very close to the centre of historic Ortigia, which is compact and surrounded by the sea.","40434":"Well situated, short walk toOrtigia. Parking available in streets close to the venue. A very clean room, and bathroom with a small shower. On second floor, no stairs. Delightful breakfast, lovely hosts.","40438":"A more accurate score would be 3.5 if half scores could be given.\n\nPros: The rooms are clean and cute. You get free parking. Staff is friendly. It\u2019s about a 15-20 walk from the old town - this can be a con if you don\u2019t want to walk back at the end of a long day. It\u2019s very close to the archeological park. It\u2019s great value for money.\n\nCons: The rooms are getting a little bit worn down and not well taken care of. The fittings in the bathroom and shower were calcified and a bit falling apart.","40441":"Great location and good value\nNeed to realise it\u2019s quite basic and no lift . Our rooms are on the 2nd floor.\nPut off by the shabby entrance hall but rooms are actually very clean and when the concierge arrived ( we had to phone ) he was very helpful though only spoke Italian.","40477":"Vittorio is perfect host. Communication was perfect we get Keys on time. Vittorio was writing to US day before Our coming to arange everything.\nLocation was perfect in center of ortiga. Room was huge, clean bed was comfortable.","40480":"Location, location, location! Great value for money and friendly staff. Bit difficult to find the first time, but once there absolutely in the middle of everything you would want to see. Air conditioning good (we had over 40 degrees celsius outside and the room stayed cool).","40485":"What can I say?! Lovely apartment, great location and brilliant service from the owner Ignazio.\nSo easy to book, great value for money and would highly recommend this place.\nThe stairs to the loft \/ bedroom are not ideal for anyone who has difficulty in climbing stairs however there is a stunning apartment and studio to the rear of the property.\nClean with everything you would need for a self catering holiday.","40504":"A very good location in a very nice town, comfortable bed fairly complete little kitchen and a helpful owner\/operator. That said I was very surprised at the level of cleanliness and can't recommend based on that alone. Ironically of all the places where we stayed in italy it was the only one that charged a cleaning fee and it was the only one that was dirty, and not just \"the maid missed a few things the last time she (or he) was in the room last\", it was the kind of buildup that happens over a long period of time and indicates extremely poor housekeeping practices.","40546":"Perfectly located B&B, only 1 min from the main square in a car-free area. The B&B is housed in a beautiful historical building and has a modern yet typically Sicilian interior.\nReception and company of the guests is absolutely top class and with an enchanting charm. One feels completely well taken care of and is well supported with every problem. It could not be better.\nThe rooms are very nice and spacious. The beds are a recreation even for guests with back pain.\nCleanliness ist top!\nWe will be back! Fantastic!","40551":"We\u2019ve just returned from a 3 night break to show my in-laws the wonderful island of Ortigia.\nMaeco was absolutely perfect for us all, the accommodation couldn\u2019t be in a better position for seeing the sights, as it\u2019s so central to everything...\nWe booked 2 rooms, 1 x triple and 1 x superior king with balcony...they did not disappoint, being spotlessly clean, comfortable, spacious and extremely quiet for a good nights sleep (in a very comfortable bed) whilst being right in the heart of things!\nThe rooms have very large well appointed en-suites, with lovely toiletries provided and slippers...and a fabulous walk in shower!\nBreakfast is of course continental style, but eggs are offered cooked to your choice. There\u2019s lots of choice - cereals, breads, toast, preserves, cake, croissants, fruit, yoghurt, meat and cheeses, juices, tea and coffee etc. and Martina is always around chatting to the guests, making sure that everyone is happy with everything....a perfect host, and so nice to talk to.\nIn summary I\u2019ve stayed in Ortigia twice before, but from now on this will be my accommodation of choice, if I could rate it 10 stars I would!\nThank you Martina and staff for a fabulous stay. :sunglasses:","40552":"Since it is located in the historical area you have to park outside. So made arrangements to have our car picked up when we got there. Garage attendant met us at Archimede Piazza to collect our car. From there we walked the final 100 meters or so to the property. Had a little difficulty finding the property because in the historical area the numbers are missing in some cases. Finally found the little sign on the wall. You have to buzz the property to be let inside. Then walk up several flights of stairs to the main floor. Valentina came down to the street to meet us and help with the luggage.\n\nThen she showed us our room to be sure it was satisfactory before checking us in. The 8 euro City Tax is paid in cash. The room was large, clean and well-appointed. The bathroom as well. The only complaint was that the towels were to thick to fit in my suitcase.:blush:\n\nBreakfast was served in a room off the main lobby. It was above average in offering and quality. Meats, cheeses, cakes, and eggs to order. There were snacks and such throughout the day. Very happy with our stay here and would return if in the area again.","40553":"One of the best 3-stars we\u2019ve ever enjoyed\u2014probably the very best. Martina runs a terrific hotel. The rooms are gorgeous, the bed huge and comfortable, the bathroom spacious. Martina herself was terrific about orienting us when we first arrived, and very helpful with all our questions about Siracusa. She\u2019s incredibly generous and informative\u2014among other things, she sent us to an authentic Sicilian seafood restaurant outside Ortigia that was fantastic. Breakfasts were excellent, and we appreciated the fact that Martina encourages her guests to converse with one another. We met two lovely couples here and shared a lot of information with each other about our experiences in Sicily\u2014some of which turned out to be incredibly valuable later in our trip. The location can\u2019t be beat: we normally like to stay away from the heart of things because we value quiet over restaurant and bar noise, but this hotel is amazingly well sound-proofed (with the one exception of the glass recycling guys who came around before 7 AM one morning). It would have been demoralizing to stay outside of Ortigia and walk in, since the neighborhood just beyond the bridges isn\u2019t all that attractive. Parking is not a problem; we stayed in the Talete parking lot, which was easy to find. We really loved our three days in Siracusa, and Mace\u00f2 is one big reason why. This hotel has our highest possible recommendation.","40555":"We booked this hotel at the last minute, after finding ourselves in much less desirable place near Catania. Our only regret was that we weren't able to stay here for a much longer time!\n\nWe were welcomed and cared for beautifully by Valentina and Martina and couldn't have felt more pampered or indulged for our brief stay. Our room was enormous and incredibly elegant and tastefully decorated. The bed and bedding were top-notch. The floors were beautiful tile that I wish I had in my own home.\n\nWe loved the views from our little mini-balcony, but the windows and shutters completely blocked sound and light when closed, so we slept soundly and woke to the best breakfast of our time in Sicily.\n\nThe location was perfect; right in the heart of it all, with easy access to the Piazza and everything in Ortigia. We parked \"off island,\" and it was an easy walk to the B and B.\n\nWe would seriously go back to Sicily just to stay at Maeco again; it was THAT good!","40560":"Martina and her staff were very welcoming and accommodating. The property is elegant and comfortable with everything I needed. The breakfast was delicious and the location right near the Piazza was convenient without being noisy. Highly recommend, grazie Martina","40562":"I\u2019d rarely give a five out of five but this place couldn\u2019t have been better. The location was perfect, just off Piazza Duomo. The staff were lovely, they seemed genuinely caring and friendly. The room was nicer than some five star hotels we\u2019ve stayed in. The breakfast was fresh, local and tasty. Lovely coffee. We enjoyed our stay here so much that we regretted only booking two nights and were looking at flights to come back and book again.","40564":"First, there are no elevators in 14th century buildings and there isn't anyone to help you carry your bags up the stairs. If that's a problem, look elsewhere.\n\nSecond, there are many reviews about the wonderful Martina. Note that she isn't always there. The other staff is fine, but not what we expected after reading the raves about Martina.\n\nThe location is absolutely wonderful and the breakfast ladies are lovely and the rooms are good-sized. Just think about those two things to know.","40565":"Superbly located B&B with an utterly charming owner who could not be more helpful. Very comfortable with great style. Strongly recommended. Just next to the two best squares surrounded by places to eat.","40566":"The B&B is in the middle of Ortigia. Everything within walking distance. The reception by Martina is very pleasant, the rooms are spacious and beautiful with great big beds.\nBreakfast is absolutely fine, with all delicious Italian products.\nMartina can tell you where to go and can also arrange a parking solution.\nStrongly recommended!","40572":"This is a very modern B & B in an old palazzo just a few steps from the Piazza del Duomo in the heart of Ortigia. Martina is a great hostess. The room was very comfortable, the breakfast is good, and she was helpful in suggesting restaurants and things to do--for example, reminding me that the sun set at 4:45 (it was November) and that the best place to watch it was from the waterfront just a couple of blocks down from the B & B. There's plenty to do, and it's a beautiful island.\n\nI was there in off-season, and since the B & B is right in the heart of things it might be noisier outside during high season. But the windows and shutters blocked out almost all the noise, and I slept peacefully even on a Friday night. November turned out to be a good time to go--the weather was very good, and Ortigia was lively without being overrun.","40573":"I stayed at Maeco b & b for 4 nights with my husband and another couple. Marina was our host and she always makes herself available. She took time to meet us in the historical area to walk us in to her b & b (no cars allowed in the historical area), she set up dinner reservations and organized a driver to the Catania airport. One of our best dinners for our 3 weeks in Sicily was Martina\u2019s recommendation. Martina also had chilled wine for us in the late afternoon. We loved this b & b-perfectly locates smack in the middle of the historical area. Turn right when you walk out the doors and you hit the architectural buildings and stunning square. Turn right and you hit the shopping and restaurants. Our room was perfect-dark for sleeping, excellent mattress and bedding, hot water and big shower and room to put our items away. The breakfast area is a common area with sweets, cheese and meats. Delicious coffee too. Maeco is located on the 2nd floor of an old palace. You need to know that there is no elevator, so you carry your luggage up a big flight of stairs. Also, anywhere in the historical area, you cannot flush toilet paper down the toilet. It didn\u2019t bother us at all, our friends took some time to get used to it. I most definitely would send our friends to stay at Maeco. Next year an area will be opened with lounge chairs and a view-in progress now.","40575":"We only spent one night here, and in retrospect that was our biggest mistake on this wonderful Sicily vacation. Beautiful B&B with first class service (for instance our parking was agreed in advance and organised in detail by the staff). You really feel welcome and can see that people here care for their place and its reputation. The location couldn't be more central - and still everything is quiet and peaceful. This is a place we want to return to!","40576":"We stayed 2 nights here. It's a beautiful big room, tastefully decorated and furnished. The bed was huge and very comfortable, the room was quiet at night. The breakfast is excellent. The location is excellent on the beautiful Ortigia - a much nicer place to stay than Syracuse itself. Martina could not have been friendlier or more helpful - she gave great suggestions for the best places to visit. We chose the parking option on the island organised by Martina and this took all the stress out of finding a place.","40577":"Literally a few steps from the cathedral main square. The accommodation was well appointed, very quiet, clean and comfortable. The staff were excellent. A real home from home, we were made extremely welcome and received really good information from the owner and host Martina. Nothing was too much trouble and she even gave us the best timings to visit places so we could get the most out of our visit. We would thoroughly recommend this B&B and hope to return one day.","40578":"I can understand why so many are happy with this location - it's within spitting distance of the beautiful main square, and while this was convenient in many ways, the busyness due to tour groups from cruise ships etc was annoying. I've started with the only downside. Apart from this, our stay was terrific. The staff were wonderful, the breakfast was incredible, when the temperature outside zoomed above 35 degrees it was bliss to come back and cool off! Our bed was wonderfully comfortable, but the single sofa was not to the same standard.","40580":"We booked a two night stay at the Maeco B&B in Ortigia. Having arrived in the morning, well before the check in time, we were pleasantly welcomed by our hostess Martina who suggested we leave our luggage with her until the room was ready. By noon our room was available. It was very clean, spacious and having a really comfortable bed, a large bathroom and a small balcony and all the other things that were promised. Very centrally situated, just off the main square, which gave us the possibility to return to our room easily. Breakfast was varied with ham, salami, cheese's, yogurt, Sicilian sweets and free flowing tea and coffee. But lingering in my mouth I still have the taste of the tangerine (mandarin) marmalade, really exceptional. As regards to our hostess Martina all we can say is a big thank you for being the one who helped to make our stay unforgettable.\nEmanuel & Antonia G.","40583":"Top quality hotel situated right next to the Piazza Duomo. Location could not be better. Stunning room and en suite. Fantastic breakfast with wide variety of breads, meats. Cheeses and much more served in a beautiful breakfast room. Service was excellent. Yes there are cheaper places but you certainly get what you pay for at this hotel. Just brilliant!","40586":"This is an elegant and very comfortable B&B in an old palazzo right in the heart of Ortigia. Martina is a lovely hostess, very welcoming and friendly with a great personal manner. The rooms have been beautifully renovated and are large and very comfortable. We were served a delicious breakfast with a great selection of sweet and savoury food and eggs made on request. I particularly appreciated the additional convenience of availability of bottled water and tea making facilities- the only B&B\/hotel offering this throughout our visit to Sicily. I highly recommend staying in this lovely B&B.","40587":"This fantastic accommodation is located in the centre of Ortigia. You are greeted by a wonderful host named Martina. The rooms are light, modern and airy with one of the best bathrooms in Italy. They provide complimentary bottles of water and the breakfast is all fresh and sourced locally. Would highly recommend.","40589":"We've stayed in Ortigia before, but this topped our last visit. Historic B and B, right in a central location, sensitively restored and beautifully fitted out. Martina was a generous host giving lots of useful information on places to visit and where to eat. Breakfasts were delicious, rooms comfortable and clean, ours had a side sea view. We'd definitely return.","40590":"This is the most amazing place to stay. Part of an old Palazzo, accessed through a pair of large old doors, off a pedestrianised street (just yards from the Duomo and main square) and then up a marble stair case, you enter a stunningly modernised hotel. A standard bedroom was of good size with hanging and drawer space, and a fantastic bathroom with excellent shower and toiletries. What makes this place stand out is the little touches. Martina has designed the rooms so that the lights and power go off when you leave, but has thought to leave one socket live so you can charge something. There is enough space to put out two wash bags in the bathroom. The beds are beautifully comfortable, and the rooms thoughtfully laid out so that they work, enough mirrors, luggage space and you do not have to dance around each other when dressing or using the bathroom. Breakfast was excellent with a range of the usual but excellent Sicilian cakes and breads, yogurts, fresh fruit, cold meats and cheeses, fresh fruit juice and plenty of coffee or speciality teas. Martina has put all her experience in the hotel business in to this venture and it really shows. Her personal service, advice and welcome is great so that you feel you are a personal friend, not just a guest. The location could not be better for accessing all the sights in Ortigia and we were only sorry that we had just one night here. Would I go back - you bet!","40591":"This is a lovely place to stay - friendly and welcoming staff, stylish rooms (though the smallest room - the Classic - is a bit cramped) and a great location. A very good continental breakfast is served in an elegant dining room.\n\nSmall touches such as the tea making facilities always available in the dining room make you feel at home.","40592":"My husband and I have just spent four nights at the Maeco and would highly recommend staying here.\n\nThe building is directly situated in the centre of Ortigia within a short walking distances to all the main restaurants and cultural sights.\n\nThe rooms are absolutely stunning with every attention to detail you can imagine. The breakfast room is a delight with a wonderful buffet selection of Sicilian delights.\n\nThe host Martinia is extremely friendly and helpful. We had a delightful stay!\nThank you.\nJanine","40593":"Our 4-night stay began with Martina graciously walking to meet us in the nearby square and directing us to the private parking garage space she had reserved for us. The B&B is in a historic stone building whose lobby is an open space with stone walls and a marble staircase. The B&B on the second floor is beautiful, and our room was large with a very clean modern bathroom. The varied breakfast is served in an elegant room by friendly staff. Excellent location in the old city, you can walk everywhere. Martina is so personable, very helpful with sightseeing and restaurant advice. By the time you leave, she seems like an old friend. It was a joy to stay here!","40598":"What a great experience. The owner Martina directed our cab to the main square where she met us. We proceeded to an older building where on the second floor it opened up to a beautiful B&B. Everyone was quit helpful especially Lucea who help retrieve my back pack on an early morning checkout. One of the better places we have stayed.","40599":"I can only agree with the many other superb reviews and details about this gem of a place of luxury - a special hideaway in the very heart of the beautiful island of Ortigia. Its charming and oh-so-helpful owner, Martina and her equally cheerful and friendly staff went out of their way to ensure that we had a wonderful time. The memory of the freshly squeezed blood orange breakfast juice and superb array of meats, cheeses, yoghurts, fruits and pastries of all descriptions will remain with us for a long time. Martina\u2019s recommendations for places to eat never disappointed and her recommendation of local guide, Masha, was second-to-none. I can not recommend this fabulous place and all connected with it highly enough. We left only yesterday and already long to return. Superb.","40601":"We selected this B&B to visit Syracuse. Only upon arrival we realized what an incredible lovely place this is and how lucky we are that we selected this B&B. We were warmly welcomed by the extremely friendly and professional Martina. The location really has one of the best spots in Ortigia. You don't need and miss your car at all. It feels great to not having to use a car actually. Martina is really extremely helpful and caring and goes out of her way to make you feel at home\/comfortable. The rooms, the huge comfortable beds, the breakfast, the cleanliness, different types of water available, fresh orange juice....it feels like you are staying in a 5 star hotel (but then with a personal touch). We also liked the fact that Martina cares about the environment and the island and this shows in her choice of local products. Our kids loved the breakfast and the wide choice of products. We loved staying in Syracuse, walking around, exploring the island and it felt great coming back to relax at the B&B every time. Thank you very much for all your effort and help to make our stay so wonderful Martina!","40604":"We chose Siracusa Ortigia as our home base in southeast Sicily for touring of the Baroque towns of Siracusa, Modica, Ragusa and Noto. After reading reviews online we opted for Maeco Ortigia B&B for our three night stay. To say the Maeco exceeded our expectations is an understatement. Maeco is housed in one part of a beautiful 14th century palazzo. As you climb the stone steps up to the Maeco location you leave history behind and enter a completely renovated space with a superior attention to detail. Martina, the charming, owner of Maeco has created a special environment for her guests. Six large rooms, beautifully decorated, with every modern convenience you can ask for. Superb space with very comfortable beds and lovely bed linens. A large bathroom with spacious vanity and large, inviting stall shower. Breakfast area is large and bright with one long table for guests to eat in the morning. Delicious array of breads, cheeses, meats, yogurt, pastries, vegetables, coffee and teas.\nLocation of Maeco was perfect. Literally steps away from Piazza del Duomo and all the shops, cafes and restaurants you could ask for. Can't say enough about Ortigia. A lovely village that that is elegant, historic and relaxing just like Maeco! Visit Ortigia and stay at Maeco! You will be very happy you did.","40609":"A gem! After a rough hotel experience down the road, we felt lucky to find this perfect BnB located in the heart of the city. We appreciated the warm welcome from our lovely host, comfortable luxury bed , peaceful sleep and the many classy touches to make our stay special.","40610":"Martina did a great job of remodeling her home for a B&B. Our room was fresh, roomy and comfortable. The location is perfectly centered in Ortigia, so easy to get everywhere. Martina and her crew were helpful, friendly, willing and very professional.","40611":"One week at Maeco B&B. Martina and her staff are doing a great job.\nThis is a stylish boutique B&B with a personal touch. The location is hard to beat, just a few steps from the duomo and a couple of minutes to all the best restaurants. The breakfast is also very good with fresh bread every day and all the espresso we want.\nIt is also very clean and tidy. Would like to come back som time.","40690":"Cute little villa in Fontane Bianche, near the beach. Basic rooms in a villa with a nice garden, but ok for the price. Some rooms have a small terrace and sea views. Owners are friendly. Fontane Bianche itself was a little boring but good for relaxing, wouldn't stay for more than one night, though.","40718":"Stayed at The Piccolo at the end of a weeks cycling holiday and very pleased with the facility. It has lots of old world charm and is conveniently located for sight seeing.\n\nOur room on the ground floor was a little small but ok for a night.\n\nNice breakfast as well.","40720":"The hotel is about a 10-15min walk to the Old Town (Ortiga) and about 20min walk to the Archaeological Park. Service was impeccably friendly and very responsive; my wifi had issues and they promptly reset the router which fixed the issue immediately. The room had ample space and had the relevant amenities, incl air condition. Shower was a bit old, small but clean. There are breakfast boxes available if you need to check out earlier. Great value for money!!","40741":"A fairly small friendly bed and breakfast hotel with plenty of restaurants around and very close to Ortigia. The rooms are a good size and clean. The staff speak good English and are very helpful. We spent our first night in the room for disabled but the bathroom had a very bad humidity problem which made it damp but we were moved immediately we pointed this out. Breakfasts are excellent. Parking is easy in a large outdoor car park within 5 minutes walk and cost a maximum of 10 euros a day. In fact we didn't move the car for 48 hours and were still only charged 10 euros. Would recommend this hotel for its convenience especially.","40749":"This hotel is located on the very busy street that connect to Ortigia island, in fact this is the street you take when you exhort the island. It is more like a pension than a hotel. It has its old world charm with the century old entry door, but wifi was miserable and the walls thin. I was yelled at by someone for talking on the phone in my room at 11:00 PM. If you drove here, parking on the street could be hard during the normal business hour. Even if you find a street parking, you have to move it by 9:00 AM or buy the parking scratch card to display them in your car to avoid getting a ticket. Rooms are basic and nothing to write home about in a post card.","40750":"We were last minute so ended up with the first room nearest the entrance and the lift. The bathroom was set up for disabled which meant the loo was high and the shower irritating. Noisy plant next door kept me awake the first night but enough wine the second night meant only woken a couple of times. Parking on street a bit of a pain as you have to get a ticket at 9:00 am if not parked on white lines. Nice breakfast and pleasant staff. Big room and all very nice and clean if a bit spartan. Would have been higher review if no noise at night. This was a major irritation to me and my wife.","40799":"In terms of location, Residence Arco Antico is superb. It is easy walking distance to many of Ortigia\u2019s charming features, including one of the best outdoor markets in Sicily. Francesco is a delightful host. I am handicapped and he was most accommodating about my mobility scooter. The apartment has everything you need. We opted not to have a balcony as it was quieter- when you\u2019re that centrally located there\u2019s bound to be some street noise.","40800":"Walking distance from public parking lot. Comfortable and clean.\nAir conditionning is top notch, internet signal is perfect.\nFrancesco is a great host and offers good advice for restaurants.\nPrice\/Value...can't go wrong! Highly recommend this place.","40806":"The location is excellent close to many cafes, restaurants and shopping. Francesco the host is very helpful, he guided us with parking our car safely and gave us very good options where to eat. The room was clean and spacious; very comfortable with a well equipped kitchen if needed. We will definitely come here again once in Syracuse. Highly recommended","40808":"The decision to stay in the ortygia area was the right one as most places of interest are there. This hotel was in a good position and made it easy to get around both in ortigia itself and back in the city. We used the red on off bus to get around the city as it was very cheap and ran regularly. We arrived by train and it was in reasonable walking distance from the station, just a bit tricky at the end trying to find the front door. Staff were always friendly and helpful and they obliged us with a quiet room on floor 3. Room was comfortable but the bed itself left room for improvement.....a fair of improvement at that.","40813":"This unit is in a fantastic position on the island. Handy to all and although the story is that its 10 mins walk from the bus or train station it took us double that and we walk everywhere. Easy directions. We hired a car on leaving and avis is very handy. A 3 minute walk. You do not want a car on the island. There are great restaurants everywhere and our host was spot on with the list of recommendations he gave us. He is very organised with information. The units are renovated and the small kitchenette is adequate for a short stay. Larger TV but no English channels. A supply of detergent and a teatowel for dishes would be good. Air con works well and no damp or mould.Bed is ok.Bathroom modern. All in all pretty good.","40815":"My wife and I spent five nights at Arco Antico last week. The location, the premises and Francesco (the host) were just perfect. The place was very clean and, on arrival, we found Francesco waiting for us with information and maps of the surroundings as well as advice on very good eateries. We hope we will have the opportunity to stay at Arco Antico when we go back to Syracuse.","40820":"The location is good so you have good access to the rest of Ortigia plus also the train station and buses which are in the other part of town. They are about a 20 minute walk away. There is a little road within a minute's walk, which is full of cafes and restaurants, plus a supermarket. The apartment itself is quite light and airy, with a fairly large bedroom and a smaller living room with a kitchenette (there were few cups and glasses as well as few kitchen utensils). There is a balcony off the living room. The bedroom has a comfortable bed. There is a television in the bedroom. The living room has a sofa, table with chairs and another television. The bathroom has a good shower with hot water. The WIFI was Ok","40879":"Stunning location only 15 minutes away by car from the city center. Our Suite \u201cApollo\u201d was the highlight of our trip in Sicily. Every inch of this building is very well kept. We had the best ever freshly squeezed orange juice every morning made by beautiful Angelo :) see ya next time","40884":"The original room that we booked was very damp and had a large area of black staining that appeared to be mould on the ceiling of the bathroom. The second room we were offered smelled very damp. The third room was only slightly damp so we stayed there. Unfortunately the hot water was not working well during our visit and we had to complain 3 times, on 3 different days. Each time it was fixed and the staff apologized but it it meant a wait of 30-60 minutes.\n\nThe website describes the setting to be a large farm but there did not appear to be any products from the farm in the breakfast buffet. The cheese and croissants were very delicious. The dining room was very pretty.\n\nOverall I had been very excited to stay at Villa Dei Papiri, the website made it appear to be a very elegant, gracious, well run establishment with great service, but unfortunately we found our stay to be very disappointing.","40885":"This was a nice place to stay. The main building was quite majestic and historical. The rooms are in small buildings in the surrounding area. They had lovely sitting areas scattered around. It was too bad that our weather wasn\u2019t that good so we didn\u2019t use them too much. Our room was good with antique furniture. Unfortunately, they had problems with the hot water when we were there. They kept trying to fix it but it kept breaking down. Too bad they didn\u2019t monitor the situation but waited until we complained about cold water before they did anything. This basically went on the whole time we were there which was for 4 days. Breakfast was ok, nothing special. Location was good. Driving distance to Siracusa was only 10 minutes.","40886":"We stayed here two years ago, accommodation was excellent. Breakfast very varied and good fresh food. The grounds are wonderful lots of room to sit and enjoy the sunshine and also see the donkeys,chickens and dogs. A good time was had by all. Only downfall was the fact that did not do evening meals although thus may have changed now.","40890":"What a lovely place to be at. A typical agriturismo\/farm....you can hear the tractors moving around all the animals on land. Loads of animals on the farm... The signore is also a be very nice and gentle human being ready and prepared to make all his guests happy. A few kilometres from the city centre and Ortigia, maybe 10 to 15 minutes drive. Very quiet and relaxing place. Very serene.\nVery much recommended.","40891":"We stayed only one night but the place is really lovely and ideal for longer stays. we enjoyed everything from location very quite and bucolic, people very kind and helpful, breakfast really good and full of choices. If we will be back in Syracuse we will definitively be back in Villa dei Papiri.","40893":"Very beautiful surroundings between the citrus trees and houding different type of animals (donkeys, goats, chickens, cats, dogs). Quiet and peacefull.\nThe buildings and accomodations are fully restored and very nice and clean. They have great beds, nice showers and overall good service. But the surrounding gardens stand out above all with big beautiful plants and a lot of places to hang out and relax.\nThe breakfast is simple but not bad.","40902":"Beautiful orange farm estate\n\nRooms r rustic but nice and comfortable\nTamara will make sure you have what u need\n\nBreakfast is a nice spread of ham cheese eggs tomatoes, fresh juices, bread , home made Apple cake by their very own cake chef Salvatore\n\nBoth Tamara and Salvatore can't speak much English but they are so warm helpful and welcoming\n\nBefore we leave they gave us a ton of orange from their farm for our road trip.\n\nWhat a nice couple who may not have a degree or attended hotel management school in Switzerland but they know more about hospitality than any GMs.\n\nThe owners must be so blessed to have them.\n\nThey showed us donkeys, chickens , goat was a wonderful experience. Even animals looked happy and well taken care of. Highly recommended","40907":"We stayed as a couple August 2018 in a standard room.It was very peaceful lovely grounds.It is a rural setting so its not a modern room but comfortable bed clean towels and sheets cleaned daily. Toilet shower and bidet all modern and very clean. Air con worked ok and internet access was good. Staff were so helpful and kind the donkeys goats and cickens at the back of reception were a bonus. There was a kettle in the room but if you want hot drinks or a bowl of cereal you will need to bring or buy your own utensils. There is a bar that provides hot drinks and you can pay for a breakfast but we didn't use it. You do need a car if you want to go further afield. There is Villa Christina not far away if you want evening meals which we cannot praise highly enough for good basic scillian cooking provided by a lovely family (they are closed on a Monday). It was a peaceful wonderful holiday the only downside was the mosquitos so if you suffer from their bites buy or bring with you lots of mozzie repellents. Also make sure if you hire a car you are well insured as the potholes and Scillian drivers are forces to be reckoned with.","40911":"it is a very quite and relaxing place. The room was comfortable, also the bathroom was spacious. The staff is very friendly and always available to assist you. For breakfast they offer a big choice, also espresso is served and a fresh juice.","40917":"We staid in Villa dei Papiri for three nights. It was rather good experience . The place is absolutely beautiful , quiet and relaxing but great potential of it just been completely ignored for some reason . Nice pool and a restaurant would improve it a lot.\nWe were accommodated in Apollo room . The room and bathroom are spacious and clean, with a small kitchenette . A kettle and some coffee \/ tea \/ sugar wouldn't hurt as the breakfast starts at 8:30. But to be fair , we could order some nice cappuccino and fresh orange juice from the bar before breakfast.\nFood variety for breakfast is modest. It's not our first agriturismo experience and breakfast was always very good. This time it was disappointing . Once they served the leftovers from a party that took place on the Villa a night before. Sad.\nThe staff is friendly and helpful, thank you guys, greatly appreciated .\n\nP.S. GPS strongly recommended.","40991":"For not cheep hotel-not good. Breakfast -terrible! Only cold pizza and too sweet cakes from shop. Noisy. Old fashion interior. Beds separated. Plus: Good garden and nice swimming pool, but that is all. Mosquitos bit me and my son at night. Not easy to find. Smell of some cleaner are too strong.","41046":"The view is incredible - but the service is better.\n\nAt arrival, I was given a thorough guide to the city, including suggestions for good local restaurants - enabling me to avoid the tourist traps.\nI was given suggestions on where to go to see most of the city in one day.\nWhen the host realised I was unable to stay long enough for breakfast, she arranged a tray with some bread and yoghurts for me to eat before I left.\n\nThe rooms are very nice. has all you need and a spectacular view.\n\nWill be back.","41060":"This is one of the most quaintest places we have ever stayed in. The views are spectacular, and as you open your bedroom window right onto the rocky shores of the sea, the setting is indescribably serene and beautiful. What was different about this vacation in a B&B, as opposed to staying in a hotel was the presence of Maria Grazia, who wore many hats, as manager, front desk reception and provider of delicious pastries, fruit and cappuccino every morning. She catered to all our whims, answered all our questions, offered touring advice and even had her husband park our car on the tight one way road in front of b&b. She was a delight, and we looked forward to seeing her bright smile every morning. There are only 5 rooms & we stayed in Eros, one of the larger suites, which was decorated in the beautiful Mediterranean colours of white and blue. We had a sofa, a nice comfortable king bed and a small desk which served as our breakfast table. As there was no restaurant on the premises, we would have our breakfast in our room and then head out for the day. If you wanted to go our for breakfast, she would give you vouchers for a lovely bakery down the road, where you could enjoy it complimentary. We had our own personal keys, and at night, when we returned from a full day, we would open & close up the gated entrance, as if we were in our own home. It was a lovely sojourn (we were there for 4 nights) and we could have stayed another 4. I would highly recommend MarLove if you are looking to stay in a small, charming bed and breakfast with personalized service, attention & of course absolutely stunning views!","41061":"We usually stay at luxury hotels, but this time we wanted something simple & affordable. This B&B is exactly that with a touch of luxury, a perfect hospitality and service with heart and care extended by Maria.\nPistachio filled croissants dropped at your bedside daily with cappuccino are to die for.\nThe sound of waves right outside our window is something I took home with me. Our room Eros was more than perfect. Location is great and safe.","41063":"Maria, the owner was a fabulous host. She had all 3 of our spotlessly clean rooms ready when we arrived early. The views were amazing - what a beautiful sunrise! Breakfast served in our rooms each day was delicious. The owner provided us with wonderful tips and made our stay perfect. Perfect location for historical site seeing.","41068":"We celebrated our 25th wedding anniversary in Sicily and stayed here. The welcome by Maria Grazia was so warm and friendly. The room, with a fantastic sea view, was clean and comfortable. Breakfast was served in the room or a voucher was provided to eat in a nearby cafe. We thoroughly enjoyed our trip and the warmth of the welcome here matched the beauty of this island. I thoroughly recommend it.","41070":"We had a great couple of days here .Maria Grazia who greeted us was extremely helpful and friendly with advice on transport ,restaurants and places of interest .The room was very comfortable and the breakfast croissants delivered to our room were the best ever !","41071":"Delightful B&B on the sea! The rooms are clean, nicely decorated & well appointed. The owner & his assistant are warm, friendly and always helpful. Close to Hop On Hop Off for easy access to all the local sights and there is on site parking, if needed. To complete the perfect B&B experience, the breakfast pastries were delicious!","41073":"Exceptional view, comfortable and very clean rooms, friendly staff. Breakfast is in a nearby bar, where you choose whatever you want.\n20 min walk to Ortigia (to me the nicest town in Sicilia) and 5 min drive to archeological place.","41075":"Lovely welcome by Maria Grazia in this super B&B. Secure parking right outside in a gated area. Beautiful airy room with aircon and 2 large windows which will open if desired. Sea view from this room (Eros). The room had everything you might need including safe, kettle and tv, wardrobe space was a little tight for two of us but we did manage. Chairs are provided to use on the sun terrace down by the waters edge.\nGreat shower too. Internet access was very good at all times.\nFor breakfast there was a choice of going to a local cafe, voucher provided by Marlove or breakfast of pastries and coffee in the room. We opted to have breakfast in the room and did not regret it. Delicious coffee and a good choice of fresh\npastries served by Maria Grazia.\nAdvice on local restaurants and bars was given and we made the most of this, eating one night at Jonico family restaurant and the next night in the cafe\/ bar just up the road. Both times the food and service were great. Maria Grazia also gave us some tips and a map for the local attractions, Parco Arceologico and Ortigia island. Both were easily reached by foot from the B&B.","41076":"This is just a simple B and B but it is outstanding. The rooms are lovely and the room we had had the most fantastic view of the sea and sunrise. The rooms were spotlessly clean and looked as if they had been decorated the day before. The whole ambience of the place is one of relaxation, this is large part to the wonderful staff who are really welcoming and go out of the way to be of assistance. We had a lovely breakfast delivered to our room each morning which was great.\n\nI have stayed in many luxury hotels both on business and on holiday over the years but MarLove is somewhere really special.\nVisiting Siracusa in October seemed to be a good time to visit the weather was warm and sunny, even swam in the sea, crowds were not great so really pleasant wandering round the old city. There are many points of interest and many excellent restaurants.\n\nSiracusa is a good destination for a short holiday but made something really special with a stay at MarLove.\nClearly my wife and I had a good time!","41175":"The location of the apartments is pretty good, on a quiet street but a short walk to the centre. The triple room we had was spacious 2 with a little terrace, kitchen and bathroom. The place is only staffed fire a few hours a day, so there is limited assistance available on site.","41182":"We enjoyed our stay very much. The location is excellent - just round the corner from the sea. We saw some lovely sunrises. Our only issue was that the apartment was advertised as having two bedrooms. The master bedroom is very comfortable and attractive but the second one comprises a sofa bed on a landing which is reached by a very narrow spiral staircase. This is not made clear on the website and it meant that one of us had to rough it. So if you really do need two bedrooms, I would give this a miss. But otherwise, it's fine. And Ortygia is a wonderful place to visit.","41188":"We booked this at very short notice as we wanted somewhere we could cook and prepare our own food. The location is very good in the heart of the old Jewish quarter, 2 streets away from the puppet theatre and opposite the hotel that has the Jewish baths in it's basement. The flat we had was at no. 67 at the top of the stairs on the left. It was a nice spacious apartment, with a student digs\/charity shop decor. It was adequate and at such short notice we felt we couldn't afford to be that fussy, but there were a lot of negatives. Cleanliness wasn't that good, we had to move a few things around and it was dirty underneath\/behind things, the bed linen left a lot to be desired, we had a grubby looking duvet with no duvet cover on it on our bed. Also after the first night we discovered there were a lot of mosquitoes hiding in the rooms. The kitchen had two fridges but no proper oven, instead we had a tiny old electric table top cooker that had clearly seen better days. The bathroom developed a strong drain smell that we managed to get rid off by running the water a lot. Also we had to buy a few things that really should have been there, like loo rolls, wine glasses and a corkscrew. And on a few occasions we nearly got locked out of the main door as the lock was so dodgy. Whilst we were there they were doing up another apartment next to ours and Denise who works there and speaks English invited us in to have a look. Now this apartment is great, great big fridge, new proper oven, nice clean duvet cover on the bed. She told us this apartment was 10 euros more expensive than ours, definitely worth the extra 10 euros. It would be good to see them do our apartment up in a similar fashion as it clearly needs modernising. Also it wasn't made completely clear to us what time we were meant to leave and at 11am we had the cleaner pounding on our door to be let in to clean. I tried to explain we would be about half an hour but it was difficult as he didn't speak any English. He then rang Denise up and handed the phone to me at which point I definitely felt harassed by her to leave, so we left on a bit of a sour note as well. There is free parking around the corner from here lorded over by a guy that tries to extort euros out of you. Phone and internet reception here were intermittent at best and when it was available it was only really in the bedroom.","41197":"This was an extremely disappointing place to stay. The apartment (we stayed in Casa Dafne, I believe, though the sign was missing) is extremely damp. Towels did not dry in the bathroom from one day to the next. The damp is so severe that the walls in the kitchen have a salt incrustation and the washing machine in the bathroom is very rusty. I'd suggest a dehumidifier. We had to wash the bathmat as it was filthy (it never dried properly). We also had to ask for the rug in the bedroom to be cleaned because we certainly wouldn't have wanted to walk on it in our bare feet.\n\nThe apartment itself was not particularly comfortable. In the small kitchen you are really squashed in around a not very big table, with only upright chairs. The bedroom, while nicely decorated, also offers you no comfortable chairs to sit in or read a book. There's no mobile-phone signal so you have to go out to the seafront to make a call.\n\nThe kitchen is pretty minimally equipped, with few utensils. No kettle. No wine glasses. No corkscrew. All in all, one of the worst apartments we've stayed in anywhere.","41203":"This place has a very nice atmosphere, is clean and quiet. The owner is very nice and helpful. We really liked to say there; I wouild always come back. Situated in the center of Ortigia it is really perfect to catch the atmosphere of old Siracusa, only a few meters away from many nice places.","41204":"This residence is a must once in your life.\nThe host family cares for everything. Right from the beginning we felt like at home. The host mum is always there when you call her even at night. All of our little extra wishes were fulfilled. The apartment is so nice, so lovely in a typical Sicilian style with all the equipment you need to enjoy your holiday, even WiFi and a washing machine.\nWe got a lot of suggestions to explore the east coast in a relaxing way every day.\nThe old town - ortigia- of Syracus is worth seeing at any time. The narrow streets with its lights gave us the feeling of being a member in a film - unbelievable.\nWe had problems with our luggage, it got lost on the flight. Our host mum tried to telephone with the airport und helped us to do copies we needed later on.\nCome to Damarete recidence and convince yourself about this marvelous place and this loving landlady.\nThere is a German saying: The guest is the king.","41207":"I found this property on holiday rentals, the family was excited and looking forward to our holiday. The website clearly stated the rates and the lady in charge sent an email quoting the price for a two week stay and asked for the deposit. I arranged with my bank to make the Euro transfer and paid the associated bank charges and sent her confirmation. She emailed thanking me, all seemed great.\n\nShe then decided to raise the price knowing I had committed to the deposit. I was forced to cancel, losing bank charges wasted time etc., I am very lucky that I have an excellent bank that STOPPED THE PAYMENT IMMEDIATELY; be very careful doing business with Ms \u2018Lucy\u2019 Lucia Lopes.","41208":"Welcoming, gracious hosts in a terrific location. This flat was very spacious and well equipped, also with a lovely roof terrace. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Ortygia itself is magical and well worth visiting if you love to wander through historical sites.","41211":"We often stay in apartments when we are in Europe, and seldom have we been welcomed as warmly and as graciously as at Casa Damarete. The apartment was perfectly located in a lovely area, very convenient, and it was clean and pretty and well-equipped. Our hostess met us at the bus station, provided us with cake, wine, mineral water, and fruit, and took us to a neighborhood grocery store when we asked how to find one. She was helpful, friendly, and available for any help we needed. The high-speed internet connection was excellent. We made good use of the washing machine, and laundry dried quickly when hung on the line on the terrace at the top of the building. The apartment had plenty of space, and it was light and airy, with windows that could be safely left open to keep the apartment fresh and aired. For English-speaking visitors, a smattering of \"travel Italian\" would be useful here, but not essential. We would love to come back to Siracusa someday, and if we do, we will definitely try to return to Casa Damarete. Thanks, Lucia!","41215":"Its was a very good stay in front of the beach! Air conditioner worked VERY WELL, good bed, nice smell towels and breakfast was lovely (high quality of cheese :cheese::ok_hand:, ham, butter and real Nutella), fruits, yogurt, italian bread, good latte macchiato and espresso, everything we needed for a VERY good price. We parked free on a small street close to the hotel.\nIt is a family hotel, 2 simpatic brothers and Valeria, who was very attentive at breakfast for every small need of us, with one of the owners, Very simpatic indeed!\nWe loved the home made croissants, very crunchy and delicious (empty, \u201cvuoto\u201d) what i like more.\nBy the way, we had a perfect Aperitivo in front of the beach right there in a Bar very close to the hotel (aprox 100 meters in the right :wink:)","41229":"This is the best Bed and Breakfast in Fontane Bianche!!! The location is perfect, the beach is not more then 5 min. walk. The rooms are very clean and comfortable. The owners GiamPoalo and his family are the best, they are very warm and lovely people!! We love this place, we have been here 2 summers and we are definitely going back in the future. Thank you for the fantastic memories!!!","41363":"We were king for a day at Re Federico. The only guests at the hotel for one night, a splendid location next to the sea. Spacious room rich of details and amenities. Fully equipped kitchen and huge batroom all spotless. We loved this place and waited to receive the morning breakfast delivered to the room on our selection basis.\nBeautiful choice, I was allowed to run along the sea cost of Ortigia this is priceless.\nThank you","41366":"Fairly new so no signs of decay (yet). Excellent breakfast. There is a rooftop terrace, but sadly enough we were only informed about this at check-out. Centrally located, but unfortunately adjacent to a main road. Keep this in mind if you are a light sleeper. Don't be fooled by the beautiful pictures of a solarium at sea. It does not belong (as is suggested) to the hotel, but is open to the public. Taking this into account, the hotel is quite expensive in terms of price \/ quality.","41370":"We stayed here for three nights in September 2019. Unfortunately we had the room on the ground floor which whilst lovely and spacious has no dedicated outdoor area as the opening patio doors lead straight on to the cafe terrace. It may also be noisier than higher rooms albeit it is a very quiet area during the night. The shared roof terrace is great though, and we had it to ourselves both times we went up there.\nBreakfast was self-service and there didn\u2019t appear to be a massive choice although I think you can ask for other things from behind the counter such as croissants etc. The coffee was excellent.\nLocation-wise, it is only a short walk to the main thoroughfares and associated shops and cafes. We arrived by train and a taxi cost 15 Euros each way - it\u2019s not really walking distance with luggage.","41373":"We stayed at the Re Frederico hotel for 2 nights in June, 2019. The decor and the location were great, the staff was helpful. Our disappointment was their breakfast, where we were served a fruit cake with mold all over it and also, spoiled peaches with fruit flies (see images). Some guests did have a piece or even a few and hopefully not kids that were staying at the hotel as well. Nothing is worse than getting food poisoning while traveling. I brought it up to the staff attention and they seamed to be shocked seeing all that. Not sure who were setting the breakfast station then... We couldn\u2019t trust their kitchen after that. Also, the WiFi only worked on the first floor or on the rooftop. Unfortunately, we were staying on the second floor and were not able to use it in the room. They\u2019ve apologized and promised to refund us, as we didn\u2019t want to stay there. Rosi even asked for my bank account in the email about a month ago but nothing happened after that. I would not recommend staying at that \u201cboutique\u201d hotel.","41376":"Spacious room and kind friendly helpful team. We had a perfect romantic escape from the world in Ortigia. Highly recommend staying here! We had an issue with random roadworks in the middle of the night which led to some pretty broken sleep - the hotel really kindly offered us a spa day to make up for this even though it wasn't their fault at all! Thanks guys!","41378":"Absolutley loved this place.\n\nLocation is super - I wouldn't have a car though. We rented ours in town when we left. I think parking could be a bit of a challenge. There was parking though, on the street.\n\nSuper walking distance to the Duomo and Castello and just beautifully located.\n\nBut the hotel is a real gem. Delightful, artsy touches without being overdone. If you are into that kind of thing and I am:)\n\nThe room itself, ours was #3, had a lovely kitchenette area and a very nice bathroom. The room was bright with lovely large window and small Juliette balcony.\n\nThe little cafe downstairs offers breakfast that suited all of our needs. Delicious cappuccino, bread, some fruit, Jogurt, cheese, meats.\n\nWould want to come back!\n\nMost cetz","41385":"This hotel has an attractive small coffee bar, accessed in Via Nizza or through the hotel itself. The coffee and croissants were very good, the premises are immaculate and the staff were cordial and efficient. There is outdoor seating in Via Nizza.","41387":"The small pearl hotel, very well positioned in Ortigia, is a very Nice starting point to visit th\u00e9 city.\nTh\u00e9 room was huge and well d\u00f4ne, th\u00e9 p\u00e9ople Nice and professional, th\u00e9 breakfast fresh and compl\u00e8te and no problems for extra Time!\nWill Be back!","41390":"Booked a great week from 12 to 19th Oct. The apartment is well furnished and modern and ideal for a couple. Our host Gianluca met us at the apartment and was very helpful from suggestions of where to eat, booking a taxi and registering our hire car so it could be parked on the island. The apartment is 2\/3 minutes walk from the main square and is ideally located for cafes and restaurants.","41395":"Another wonderful stay in Gianluca\u2019s superb apartment. Everything you can want from a holiday let and we cannot fault it. The apartment was spotlessly clean, very comfortable and in an excellent position. Gianluca is the perfect host! Can\u2019t wait to return again.\nVanessa and Peter.","41396":"Talia Ortigia is a very comfortable apartment, located just 200 m from the Duomo. Nearby you will find plenty of dining options. The fish and vegetable market is only 10 min. walk. The apartment is 15 minute walk to Talete Parking, which is the most convenient place to park your car. The apartment is very new, clean and modern. The kitchen is equipped with all kind of appliances you will need to prepare your food. There is an air conditioning in each room and a very good WI FI connection.\nGianluca is a very good host. He was very helpful with all information we needed during our stay.\nTalia Ortigia is the perfect place to stay in Ortigia and explore the beautiful Siracusa.","41405":"We really enjoyed our week in this apartment with its lovely bright living space (just enough kitchen ware to create three evening meals from foods purchased at the markets), small room with the laundry, and large bedroom.\n\nThere were some basic pantry items but we had to replenish the olive oil and toilet paper supply. The small supermarket is on Via Cavour - less than five minute walk.\n\nThe apartment was in a great location. For visiting sites off Ortigia either by bus or car, it was good to be staying at the north end of Ortigia, close to a lot of restaurants and the market (ten minute walk) and a 15 minute walk to Talete Parking station. The swimming platform was a 15 minute walk away across the island.\n\nThere were some great restaurants nearby as well- Gianlucca recommended Sicilia in Tavola, Appolonion, and sandwiches by Bordieri (at the markets), and all were great recommendations.\n\nThere were no luggage racks but a wardrobe. We ended up with both suitcases on the floor. Hotels and other accommodation providers should recognise that two people staying in one room have a piece of luggage each.","41468":"Eurialo - very warm, family atmosphere...Mr and Mrs Del'Aqua - very professional owners of that charming B&B. We truely appreciate their extremely efficient running of that place, comfort, privacy and trust that they gave us as well as unusuall atmosphere of that place that they create.\nThank you very much for being there for us in any time and possibility of seeing so many places. We both hope to come back there soon!\nThank you for you help. Your suggestions concerning interesting places to see were priceless. We really appreciate the culinary craftsmanship of Mrs Del'Aqua, which is the real heart of Eurialo...\nLots of warm hugs and wish you all the best!\nSylwia and Karolina","41498":"As the brochure states this hotel is situated in the bright countryside. It has contemporary style whilst surrounded by its historic farm skeleton. The rooms were well appointed and were very clean and tidy. We had a great view of the open countryside. The two main issues for us were, the hotel was too remote and the bar \/ restaurant staff lacked knowledge of their products including drinks \/ wine. On our last night at this hotel it became obvious they were struggling with the number of guests and their needs in the restaurant.","41502":"Enjoyed this hotel. A few things you should know . Be early for breakfast as the inhabitants of the tour buses are like a plague of locusts and the food is not replenished ! Similarly in the evening as the hotel restaurant is always booked out and understaffed as it seeing to the tour busses !\n\nApart for, that , nice and clean and quiet .","41503":"Nice modern hotel in a quiet area. Good size rooms with everything one could require. All staff were very good. Restaurant was good although why any one would need 24 sweet dishes for breakfast is a mystery. Comfortable beds and enjoyable experience","41508":"A nice clean hotel in open countryside large swimming pool also has small multi gym large rooms comfortable beds my room had a small safe and a fridge you will need transport as there is nothing close by","41523":"Biggest bed we had in Italy. Lovely big room with cable tv. Had a complete bathroom which we found to be an exception so were pleased. We are at the outdoor restaurant (since we were remote from the town) and had unlimited pizza which was tasty.\nNice place for a wedding.","41527":"Staff friendly and helpful. Room was clean, big and comfortable. Large pool area but it was actually too hot to be outside. Bar service very slow but ptices were reasonable. Definitely need a car as it is in the middle of nowhere. Dinner was very good. Breakfast had enough variety. Ask for coffee to be made- don't use the machine!! All in all a good place to stay. Trouble with TV in my room- problem was attended to promptly and efficiently.","41530":"This hotel has loads of charm and warmth. We really enjoyed our stay (2 nights in June 2019) at this place. They have transformed a rural set of buildings in a nice resort that exudes charm in every corner. The service is great, the room was very nice and the whole facility was excellent. As far as location is concerned, it's a bit off the beaten tracks but that is maybe one of its best features.","41536":"We stayed one night in this hotel, located in stunning countryside. The hotel is enormous, with a number of dining areas, set up for weddings, events, etc. Breakfast was typical for an upscale hotel in Sicily, lots of pastries, cakes, yogurt, pre-cooked egg dishes, meat\/cheese platters. We had dinner at the hotel, and found it to be good if not great, and specializing in regional cooking. The room was clean, contemporary and comfortable, but we long for bigger shower stalls!","41549":"We stayed 1 night between Siracusa and Palermo. What a treat. It was the only B&B we stayed in during a trip to Sicily and it was first class. The setting and hostess were great - with a beautiful garden and excellent breakfast including fresh ricotta for \u201cdessert.\u201d The town is lovely and we were lucky to be there the night of a street food festival. Marina di Ragusa is a very nice beach about 30 minutes away. Getting to the house is a bit complicated so be patient but worth the effort.","41550":"We stayed for three nights and loved our stay! The rooms are fairly basic but plenty of room and good shower. Wifi is great. What makes this five stars is: 1. Giovanna and her staff. They are so helpful and make your stay special. Breakfast was the best of our 15 day Sicily stay. Any questions or suggestions, they are there to help. 2. The outdoor space is magical. We spent much time outside with bottles of wine and snacks and had such a view of the city. Met such nice people while we were there. 3. The downtown area is just a block away. Step out and to the right and you are there in the main piazza. We would def stay again!","41551":"My wife and I stayed for six nights. Beautiful garden, nice bedroom and fantastic breakfast. The proprietor Giovanna and her team were excellent. Wonderful breakfast included. The garden has a romantic terrace, hot tub and plunge pool and hammocks. Central location in Ragusa Ibla, the historical and romantic part of Ragusa city. Short walk to restaurants, caf\u00e9s, small supermarkets and gelaterias and bus stop for downtown and beach at Ragusa Marina. The B&B has a fridge to store drinks and robust Wi-Fi.\n\nHope to visit again one day....","41560":"This unassuming B&B was a wonderful find - a oasis amid the bustling tourist town. The welcome and superb breakfast, added to the tranquillity and restorative effects of the dipping pool and beautiful garden made for a truly lovely stay.","41561":"Like everyone else, I can do nothing but rave about this B&B; it is very much like being welcomed into the family home of a fabulous cook, and wonderful person.\n\nTo avoid repeating what others have said about the stunning views, delicious breakfasts and so on, I'll talk a little more about the garden, which is a paradise for wildlife in a small space.\n\nIt is on two levels: the upper level has the terrace where breakfast is served, and the jacuzzi, and it also has some hanging baskets. Swifts and swallows swoop around, and there were goldfinches nesting in the baskets (ignoring the nesting boxes, as is the way of birds). There is jasmine growing all around it, with a wonderful scent.\n\nYou descend to the lower level, which has the pool, via stone steps cut into the mountainside, and there you will find bee-friendly plants in profusion, as well as some very comfy hammocks from which to admire the view. The pool is gorgeous, and very refreshing in the intense heat.\n\nOn the way down to the gardens, there is a level with some plant boxes that house a turtle family: two parents and a youngster. Be careful not to step on the young one, as he likes to go wandering across the path!\n\nOur room had a balcony overlooking the gardens, and the scent of the jasmine also wafted up to it. Lovely.","41562":"It\u2019s not easy to get to but once you get there the place is very clean and has an excellent view. The dinner place Johana recommended, the name might be Fish a More, had excellent food and wine. Also, breakfast they made for us including the fresh Ricotta cheese was one of the very memorable meals that we had this trip.","41567":"Beautiful hotel... little hard to find. Great location near the Duomo of San Giorgio. Perfect for walking around the shops and restaurants. Spacious and comfortable room with a gracious host. Can't wait to return and to the \"Ibla Freedom Trail\" LOL... Thank you for the Oregano... we have been using it and thinking of you. Grazie!!!","41568":"Two weeks driving around Sicily, this was the best B&B of our trip. The rooms are small, but the hosts and the gardens made up for it. So nice and friendly. The best breakfast of the entire trip. Nice views, and a great town to visit. Be aware that the road to the property is a one-way and there is limited parallel parking. You may have to park and walk a bit to get to the door. Once you arrive, they will give you a parking pass to place on the dash. TIP: I would strongly advise all USA visitors to buy an inexpensive SIM card when you arrive in Italy so you will be able to call ahead to your hosts. They can be very helpful in giving you directions to find the property, and where to park, etc. Many of these old cities are difficult to navigate and find the actual door \/ address, and the streets are very narrow. Your GPS may not get you exactly to the property.","41574":"A wonderful B & B in the heart of the old town Regusa. The host Giovanna was an amazing hostess, we felt so welcomed. The breakfast was superb and her newly installed dipping pool was the icing on the cake, after walking the streets of Regusa, All in all one of the best recommendations I could give","41575":"We stayed here for three nights recently and loved every minute of it. There is not much more to add to the already long list of good reviews. Comfortable rooms and lovely terrace for breakfast (excellent and plentiful!) and for relaxing, overlooking the valley. However, it was our hostess Giovanna who made the stay - Ever helpful and smiling. She organised a driver to take us on a Montalbano tour which we thoroughly enjoyed. We wholeheartedly recommend this b & b if you visit Ragusa Ibla.","41582":"What a comfortable and beautiful bed and breakfast in the exquisite town of Ragusa Ibla. La Casa del Gelsomino is a very short walk (5 minutes?) to the Duomo, which then leads down the main street with its shops, ice cream places, churches and restaurants. Giovanna, the owner welcomed us warmly and showed us to a beautiful room in the back, overlooking the valley and above the breakfast terrace and even further above the shallow stream-like jacuzzi pool she and her husband have created, which is surrounded by comfortable lounge chairs and a hammock. From the street you would never imagine the beauty that lies beyond! Our room was very comfortable and the bathroom, altho small, had everything we needed, including a terrific shower with strong water pressure. Cooling off in the pool was a perfect way to take a break from the June heat. Breakfast was extraordinary, as others have mentioned. The warm ricotta from a local farm, served each morning in a bamboo \"tube\" was fresh and delicious. There was also yogurt and fruit and meats and cheese- and delicious bread and rolls. It was hard to say good-bye. Giovanna gave us a perfect dinner recommendation, called and reserved and even recommended what we should order- a full multi-course fish dinner, which did not disappoint. We sadly said our good-byes and we were given an aromatic bunch of dried oregano, complete with the oral instruction to add it to our food after the meal was cooked. We highly recommend La Casa del Gelsomino and thanks again to Giovanna and her lovely traveling daughter!","41588":"I phoned the evening before arrival to check on parking which can be difficult in the old town residential quarter, just adjacent to the Piazza Duomo. Carmela put me at my ease explaining the situation, and Giovanna was immediately available to assist when we arrived without difficulty. This is a well-respected, family-run B&B in the heart of a UNESCO-listed World Heritage site. This is certainly the place to stay in Ragusa: some other guests were returning for a second stay (as we will do). And as most of the reviews make clear, proprietress Giovanna is a most pleasant and helpful person - not to mention her specially-prepared breakfasts (included in the room price).","41589":"We truly loved our stay here at the B & B. First off, the hosts are wonderful. They are kind, sincere, professional and welcoming. Communication was always excellent. Upon arrival, we were given a brief breakdown of the city and helpful suggestions on what to see and where to eat. Parking in historical towns in general isn't easy but it was here, as we could park anywhere down the street in front of the B & B. The B & B is also conveniently located close to the city centre and the main piazza and duomo. The room was extremely clean, with air conditioning and wifi that worked perfectly. We appreciated the beach towels that were also provided. The garden is definitely special, and there is a fantastic view of the city. We would often sit on the lounging chairs under the scented jasmine trees and read, nap or just gaze out. Their garden is a great place to relax after a long day of sight seeing or during the afternoon siesta time when it's hot in the summer. The breakfast in the garden is also quite special, serving all local foods. We highly recommend this B & B and the warm hospitality of Giovanna, Carmela and the rest of the family. Grazie mille Giovanna! Speriamo riverdervi!","41637":"My sisters and cousins and I stayed at Artemisia for several days while visiting our grandmother\u2019s village in Ragusa Ibla. Our rooms were spotless, comfortable, beautiful. The daily breakfast was the best we had during our three weeks in Italy, with delicious and numerous choices to please all palates. The grounds were lush and peaceful. The staff was professional, attentive and friendly. I highly recommend this gem.","41649":"We loved the Artemisia resort. We\u2019ve not given it 5\/5 because it\u2019s location isn\u2019t great (quite isolated and with no local restaurants) and there is no restaurant on site, but the tranquility of the place itself, the pool, the breakfasts, and particularly the kindness and attentiveness of the staff, are what make. Do beware that they offer the option of having a meal delivered by a local restaurant - the Monna Lisa - don\u2019t be tempted, it\u2019s not good, and the promised \u201cwithin 15 minutes\u201d is misleadingly optimistic. But the Artemisia is a really relaxing place to return to after visiting Ragusa etc, and as long as you know what to expect, we\u2019d thoroughly recommend it.","41650":"We chose this hotel as we wanted to be near Ragusa for sight seeing but also keen to avoid the narrow streets of Ragusa for driving and parking our car rental. We were really pleased with our choice; we had a spacious room, modern bathroom, with large shower, and patio seating outside our room. In addition the hotel has a large pool with plenty sun loungers\/ seating and a gorgeous patio where we enjoyed a sumptious breakfast and dinner. The hotel doesn't offer a dinner service, instead it has a delivery arrangement with a nearby Trattoria. We took advantage of this one evening, the food was excellent, delivered in around 15 minutes - salad, pasta main, pizza and wine cost 30 euro. Artemisa is a little remote, there isn't a restaurant in walking distance but it is a peaceful setting.\n\nWe found all the staff very welcoming, English speaking and friendly. In Ragusa we used the public car park (Parcheggio) in Ragusa Ibla (old town), a 15 minute drive from Artemisia. On our second evening we enjoyed a fantastic meal at Agli Archi Trattoria in Ragusa Ibla.\n\nThe hotel also offers Afternoon tea, with a wide variety of biscuits, cakes and teas for 6 euros.\n\nOverall, the hotel offered excellent value for money. We thoroughly enjoyed our 2 day stay.","41667":"We have just spent 3 nights at Artemisia with family and friend and this place exceeds all expectations. The location and surroundings are splendid, rooms are spotless, facilities are great, breakfast is delicious but most of all the service by the resort personnel is top notch. It was our first time there but surely not our last! Outstanding!","41678":"We spent two weeks at Artemisia in May 2019. It is well located in the countryside but only five minutes into the centre of Ragusa. The buildings and grounds are well maintained, attractive and the overall ambience is restful and relaxing. The staff were really welcoming and helpful and most of the ones we met spoke English. Francesca, Valentina and Samantha made our stay memorable. Breakfasts were excellent with a great variety to satisfy anyone's needs. The room ( Number 1) was spacious, well equipped, comfortable and well located. We enjoyed the lovely pool and were amazed at the support the staff gave us when we wanted to use the barbeque area. Rooms were cleaned daily and to a high standard. Artemisia is a lovely location and we would happily stay there again.","41686":"This was perhaps our biggest bargain during our May 2018 visit to Sicily. The Artemisia Resort has a lovely staff, the rooms are not luxurious, but large and clean. The resort itself is in the countryside and very quiet. The staff made several helpful suggestions for dinner in Ragusa and found a driver that would take us there as well for a very reasonable price. In the morning, we enjoyed the plentiful (and delicious) breakfast options, and also purchased some organic produce that's available for sale at the front desk. Definitely worth a return visit!","41687":"Charming bnb with a wonderful host. We had a room on the second floor with a balcony facing the street. Breakfast is served on the top floor with a hearty spread of scaccia (a local lasagne bread\/pie), homemade cakes, pies and even Modica chocolates. The host is a very nice young guy who takes time to attend to our questions and helped us with our parking. Lots of good restaurants in the vicinity but our favourite is the salumeria just next door that serves wonderful cheese and salami. Ragusa is a beautiful town and we will definitely be back.","41688":"On suggestion of friends we chose to stay two nights in Ragusa Ibla. We were so glad we did - it is a beautiful old town with amazing food. However, an old town on top of a hill means a windy road to reach it and unfortunately we had some trouble finding the b&b. The parking is difficult, especially if you are not used to old towns in Italy and their narrow roads and tight parking scenarios. Just be aware of what awaits you and probably best to arrive in the day time.\n\nThe b&b staff were nice and the room was clean (we had a standard double room which was sufficient). The roof terrace is lovely and we enjoyed a nice night cap on the roof one night - unfortunately all breakfasts were served inside due to weather. There is a bit of noise (especially on the weekends) from the restaurant across the laneway but earplugs helped and it didn't go too late. Noting that we had a lower floor front facing room so likely more susceptible to noise.\n\nWould I stay here again? I think so - despite finding the driving and parking extremely stressful it was a newer, cleaner B&B run by young people - so definitely didn't feel stuffy or old like some B&B's. Also Ragusa Ibla really is so beautiful and expect it's popularity only to increase. Next time though I would hire an even smaller car....","41691":"As the name in English translates \u2018A Dream of a Terrace\u2019 and it sure lives up to its name.\nA beautifully renovated 4 level building.\nOur room was a good size and light and airy with a large shower.\nBreakfast was served up on the rooftop terrace with views over the Ragusa rooftops and was a small but adequate selection of sweet and savoury.\nWe enjoyed the terrace on other occasions sunbathing and having drinks up there at sunset and were the only ones to have it all to ourselves.\nPleasant young owners, excellent central location and a lovely peaceful stay.","41692":"Enjoyed a 3 night stay in beautiful Ragusa. Emilio and company make you feel welcome at this beautifully restored B&B with contemporary rooms. The location is great...close to many restaurants and parking. Emilio will help you on where to park since Ragusa can be a bit challenging with its narrow roads. Breakfast is very good with homemade cakes, fruit, cereals and meats. We had wine every night on the rooftop terrace which overlooked the tiled roofs of the city, as well as churches and surrounding green landscape. All in all a great choice for Ragusa.","41693":"We rented two rooms there and stayed one night.\n\nLocation is perfect, in a little street right in the centre.\n\nThe rooms were clean and new, and the whole building was well kept and comfortable (no elevator though). Emilio at the front desk was very friendly and always ready to answer any question or doubt, pleasant to talk with.\n\nThe terrace for breakfast and for hanging out has an amazing view over the city, it\u2019s a nice spot to see. Breakfast in the morning is also nice, with fruits and homemade cakes - all accompanied with nice coffee or cappuccino. A nice addition would be to add more salty options (eg, eggs, tomatoes..) to widen variety of the offer.\n\nRecommended!!","41697":"Modern, very clean, a good price\nI don\u2019t know what else you need to stay in Ragusa.\n\nThis place is in a great location. Many restaurants near by.( It takes less than 10min to walk to Duomo. )\nThe bed was comfortable, water pressure in shower was good, view was very nice, and staff at the front desk was very kind. There are a tv, a full body mirror, ac, a small refrigerator with beers and enough hangers. What I really like was they gave 3 towels per guests. ( small, medium and large )\nThis place knows how to host the guests! :blush:\n\nComplementary breakfast was good. Simple. Nice to have it on the roof. Beautiful view from there.\n\nThe only negative things was restaurants near by open until late and you can hear them. If you are a light sleeper this place is not for you. We were so tired so it was not a problem.\n\nOverall I would recommend this place to people.","41699":"Superb views over Ragusa Ibla and Inspector Montalbano\u2019s favourite trattoria! Room a bit cramped. Breakfast very good and home made. Only criticism is for a small B&B it felt rather over-priced. Parking easily available nearby.","41701":"We stayed here for five nights to use ibla as a base for south east sicily. We chose Emilio's place based on reviews and we were very happy with it.\nLocation is very good, and at this end of town parking is relatively easy, Emilio is very helpful in advising where and where not to park.\nOur room was very clean, large enough and the wifi worked well. The b&b is down a little side road, so very little noise. We had breakfast on the terrace every day as the weather was great, and it is a nice experience with plenty to choose from.\nThe terrace is also where we spent some afternoons, very nice indeed.\nOur room had a safe box as well, very useful.\nWe would recommend this as a good choice for ibla.","41706":"We visited Ragusa in early October, and thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the B&B Terrazza dei Sogni. Located on a side street (hence quiet) off the main street in Ragusa Ilba, the location couldn't have been better for exploring the town on foot. The weather didn't cooperate much, so unfortunately we didn't have much time to enjoy the rooftop terrazzo, but we did get to sip a glass of wine there one evening, enjoying the view out over the rooftops of the town. Prior to our arrival, since we were driving, I was a bit worried about possible ZTL issues and difficulty parking, but Emilio, the owner, reassured me on both counts, and he was absolutely correct. Speaking of Emilio, he was a perfect host, loaning us umbrellas when rain hit unexpectedly, suggesting laces to visit, where we might find parking, etc. The rooms were more than adequate, the breakfasts were good and we enjoyed our stay.","41707":"I stayed at this lovely and beautiful B&B for 3 days visiting the most of \"Inspector Montalbano\" spots among other activities.\n\nThe attention received was fenomenal since the time of booking as received an email from the B&B explaining how to get to the place and where to park the car (very close from it and for free).\n\nRoom was modern, big enough with a nice bathroom, very clean and comfortable. I think, the business is on for 3 years and the building was fully refurbished.\nBed was very good, I was able to have very good quality sleep (not easy thing when you are \"on the road\").\nEven I got the surprise that the room was cleaned every morning (something I was not expecting on a B&B - you go the extra mile Emilio and Laura).\n\nOn the rooftop you have the \"Terraza\", and from here you have spectacular views of Ragusa Ibla and the surroundings - specially at nights.\nEmilio (the manager of the place) told me that they do the breakfast on the terrazza in Summer but now in October it's already too cold (next time I will come in Summer).\n\nBreakfast is v good and variate plenty of different options: fruits, sweets and salty. Special mention to the homemade apple pie.\n\nPlace very well located, near lot of places to visit and plenty of local restaurants and shops.\n\nI asked Emilio for some recommendations and think this was key differentiator for me to discover some places in Ragusa.\n\nI will definitely repeat if coming back as my expectations were exceeded.\n\nMany thanks for everything.\nAll best","41708":"We stayed at this B&B for 2 nights earlier this month as part of a 2 centre long weekend in Sicily, before heading on to Taormina. It was a bit daunting finding its location in our hire car, so make sure you have GPS, but once there it was the perfect peaceful base for exploring the old town of Ragusa, and enjoying the ambience and restaurants. We drove through the newer Ragusa to get there and were very pleased to find Ragusa Ibla was a different world, virtually pedestrianized and with historic baroque churches around every corner, so good for wandering.\nOur room 1 was on the 1st floor and had a small balcony \u2013 no view over the roof tops at this level but across the next door restaurant terrace. There was a table and chairs on the balcony, had we had more time to enjoy a glass of wine out there. In any case it was nice to have the balcony door open to let the mild outdoor air in. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom modern with a powerful shower and no issues with hot water. The room had everything we needed.\nThe roof terrace must be a wonderful spot to enjoy breakfast in the summer, but it was too cold at this time of year. It was still nice though to pop up there to view the roof tops, and the spires and domes lit up at night.\nBreakfast is taken at this time of year in a room on the 2nd floor. On our first morning there was a large selection laid out on the side and on our second day it was a smaller selection on our individual table as we were the only guests staying. Both days there was lovely cheese, some salami, fruit, yoghurt, savoury pastries, and cakes. The only thing we felt it lacked was soft bread \u2013 the first day there was just some rather dry brown bread and the second day the same bread was given to us toasted. Also as another guest has commented below, you felt you were causing hassle by asking for coffee (and refills), and the machine was slow. There wasn\u2019t an option to help yourself to coffee and the way the room was set out, the coffee machine wasn\u2019t easily accessible as it was in the far corner but that could easily be changed around.\nEmilio was a welcoming host and provided us with a parking permit to put in our car for the duration of our stay, having advised us of the area suitable for parking 5 mins walk way.\nThere seemed to be numerous local restaurants locally on Tripadvisor but we found that in reality, a number were shut at this time of year, so do plan ahead. We didn\u2019t rate Monsu next door (the food quality didn\u2019t live up to appearances or the reviews), but we did have a nice meal at OFF Odierna Finestre Ferreri, which is down towards the park. And then of course there\u2019s the lovely range of Italian ice cream to sample at Gelati DiVini (where you can also drink wine and limoncello of an evening!), and the Modica chocolate is excellent between times!\nOverall this B&B is a great base to explore the SE corner of Sicily at a good price compared to hotels, and with all the facilities you need for a short stay.","41709":"Everything was fine - nice roof top terrace. Litte fridge in the room - perfekt.They are serving local craft beer (in the fridge) - definately my highlight after a long hot day. :-)Location is in the heart of the old town. Very close is a nice park an a bus stop. From there you will get quick to the upper town. Nice restaurants near by.","41712":"Very clean, modern hotel, with very friendly staff, and a good breakfast on the terrace. The bed, air conditioning, and shower are all excellent. Breakfast (served only from 8-10) could be improved with self-service coffee (one has to place an order).","41714":"I absolutely loved Ragusa and Terrazza Dei Sogni. The inn is beautifully decorated, clean and very relaxing. Even though it rained during our stay the balconies and the terrace were a great place to relax outside. The breakfast was complete. And both Emilio and his staff were lovely. I\u2019ll be back again!","41716":"We loved Emilio\u2019s B&B. It\u2019s in the middle of beautiful Ragusa Ibla, close to many restaurants. The room is modern, comfortable and very clean. The roof top terrace is magnificent, for having breakfast in the morning, for relaxing in the sun (though quite hot in summer) and for watching the stars in the late evening . Communication with Emilio went smoothly. We felt welcome from the first till the last hour of our stay. So, if you\u2019re looking for a special place: here\u2019s one!","41718":"Spent a night here. The room is nice and clean, with a small table n two chairs on a small balcony; would have used it if we had stayed another day or had a little more time! Breakfast is at the rooftop which is nicely decorated and has a great view. The only negative was having to struggle up two floors with luggage - no lift.","41719":"We had a wonderfull stay, suchs a warm welkom.Super clean, beautifully furnisched! The view on the roof top stunning! The location really great!! Near a park, full of nice restaurants and in the centre. The parking was no problem, easy to find a spot!\nWe felt at home right away thanks to the owner, so, so friendly and the atmosfeer he created with a beautiful authentic style. It's really a great experience!","41720":"The B&B is excellent. Although the room was small, it was very quiet, with tasteful and modern decor, and had a patio. We even slept with the windows open. The best thing was probably the breakfast, which had many local products and was served on the rooftop--under sunshades--from which we had an amazing view. Laura made us Cappuccini to order :) Emilio was a gracious host. We are very glad we picked this B&B--definitely worth the expense. Grazie!","41721":"Just off the main thoroughfare of Ragusa Ibla, it is quiet enough despite the nearby catering establishments. The room we had was excellent in every aspect, complemented by the roof terrace which commands a wonderful view of Ragusa. Mention must be made of the friendly staff who made our stay a most enjoyable one.","41722":"super room, perfect location, great rooftop lounge, great breakfast spread. Such a great place. Loved everything about this stay. It was clean, and sunny, and breezy even on hot days. The deck was a great place to relax with a glass of wine in the evenings","41724":"The B & B is located on a quiet side street. Free on-street parking is available nearby. Emilio was a great help with information and recommendations; he was spot on! Our room was well appointed and had a cute balcony. Both it and the bathroom were clean. The breakfast buffet was just fair, but served on a lovely terrace. Checking in and out was a breeze. Overall good value.","41725":"We stayed here and enjoyed our location within walking distance to all of the important sites. The staff was most helpful in a regards helping direct us to the hotel with road directions. The breakfast was ample and attended by a hostess who was very friendly. We appreciated Emilio's assistance with parking.","41728":"Our wonderful 3-night visit began with a welcome from Emilio who then directed us to the free parking area two blocks away. Room #1 was charming with its brick wall, balcony with a table for two, and immaculate with a modern bathroom. The B&B is well-located in the old city of Ragusa Ibla where everything is within walking distance. Breakfast was delicious and varied. We enjoyed our morning conversations with one of the servers, Georgia, who speaks perfect English and baked the lemon sponge cake, apple cake, and spinach raisin pie. Our photos from the rooftop terrace are perhaps the most picturesque of all of our pictures of Sicily.","41731":"Terrazza dei Signori is a pleasant B&B in the heart of Ibla and close to the bus stop that services Rufus\u2019s Superior.\nCreated 3 years ago the owners have rebuilt it from scratch.\nSome things to keep in mind:\n1. There is no common room except for an open air terrace on the roof which is unusable in winter, most of autumn and the first half of spring. Remember this is mountain country. If you want to eat a lunch or pizza, you will have to do it in your room. We were told, unsolicited, that we were welcome to use the bad weather breakfast room and then were rudely told not to use it when we sat at a table with sandwiches. No cutlery, plates or glasses being used - just the paper bag the focaccia came in.\n2. Subsequent to the previous point, there is no ability to make coffee or tea or simply heat water.\n3. The building is not friendly for those who are elderly, inferm or have heavy or a quantity of bags. There are 16 stairs to the first two rooms and a further 22 to the majority of the rest of the rooms. If you want to go to the roof terrace it is another 23 steps to negotiate. The stairwell is very narrow, allowing for one person only. With this in mind, breakfast is provided every day on the top floor terrace in the warmer\/dry months.\n4. Many rooms face onto a restaurant which can be noisy, particularly as it\u2019s at the end of an alley which acts as an echo chamber. The chimney from another adjacent restaurant smokes most nights and requires you to keep your balcony doors closed. The smell is not pleasant.","41737":"A great B+B very handy for the local bus...and all the other sights in Ragusa Ibla. Very warm welcome from the hosts and magnificent breakfast in the Italian style ie cakes! and seasonal fruits...I've never eaten prickly pears before!\nRoom had its own little balcony but I didn't make much use of the fantastic rooftop balcony as it was dark by 6.30 pm in late October but I can imagine that in the summer it is great.","41738":"A super, clean b & b with excellent breakfast. Clean, modern interior with lovely roof terrace. Convenient location for town visit. Friendly staff. Double glazing not perfectly soundproofed. Parking is possible within reasonable distance however be very careful to check all signs. Our host assured us the space was fine for the length of our stay however it transpired that it was a market venue and our car was towed away on our last morning. Host helped us retrieve it but it cost us 130 euros. One of our party speaks Italian and is sure that there was not a sign to warn of market etc. Our host did not apologise for his error or offer to share the payment of the fine, the least one should expect. A great pity as we enjoyed our stay but it left us all angry and disappointed.","41739":"This was one of our favorite, possibly our favorite, places we stayed on our recent trip to Sicily. The room was very comfortable, beautifully decorated, clean, and we appreciated the cold water that was replaced daily in the refrigerator. The water pressure was good, the bed was comfortable.\n\nThe breakfast was very good and I enjoyed hearing about the source of the food - the tomato scacce (stuffed bread) and the local cookies were delicious!\n\nThe host was very helpful and we appreciated his finding us a taxi at a good rate to get to our next destination.\n\nThe B&B is in a good position of the Ibla and our stay was very quiet. I would definitely stay here again if we return to Ragusa.","41760":"This B&B has it all. Great location, nice rooms, great views from the rooftop (where a lovely and very different breakfast is served) and Emile as the perfect host. He went out of his way to help us to enjoy our stay in Ragusa.","41765":"Spent five days at this hotel and the experience was more than perfect for a three star hotel. Rooms were large and attractive and well furnished. Staff was brilliant and always willing to help. The star of this property is the private beach just seconds awat from the hotel. Perfect place to relax and enjoy open views of the sea. Breakfast was not lavish but good enough with a variety of pastries and cereals . on site bar makes great coffee and ideal for an aperitivo before haeding out. Location is also perfect and on the lungomare,less then 10 minute walk to the center of Ragusa. Excellent restaurants also very close to the hotel\nReally could not find fault with the hotel and recommend it fully. Will definately be returning","41769":"We stayed in the bungalow part with a family with 3 children and enjoyed our stay. Bungalow was very small but the people were very nice and helpfull. A few hondred m from the town Marina di Ragusa. So quiet and at the same time close to everything. Nice swimming pool and restaurant. Wifi was rather poor.","41773":"Just sent a week at Baia del Sole and can\u2019t fault it. Reception staff were so polite and helpful, room spotlessly clean and breakfast great. Bar area very pleasant with reasonable prices, full of Italian holidaymakers. Great base for Montalbano tour, do it yourself on local buses.Hope to return","41777":"everything OK,\nbut needs a new refresh look and better breakfast.\nbeach & pool fantastic, staff very help full and friendly.\nanimators, well done keep it up.\nsafe inside parking.\nyou can find many necessities inside the resort,\nall in all it was nice and ok","41788":"First the good news: the hotel staff especially the receptionist was very helpful and friendly and tried her best to make up for the hotels shortcomings.\nNow the bad:The pool is closed at the end of the season so don't visit out of season if a pool is a priority. The breakfast food was of very poor quality and even poorer variety. Again because we went in October, when it rained heavily (Which it does in Sept and October) our room was flooded. The bathroom was adequate but needed an update. The hotel bar also closes early out of season.","41824":"This is a gem of a hotel. Located across the road from the beach with its own enormous swimming pool lovingly tended by the young lifeguard who keeps the area very tidy. The rooms are spacious which t.v, air conditioning, hair dryer and free wifi. The bathroom has a double shower and comes with plenty of toiletries. The balcony is very large and offers a side-view glimpse of the sea through the trees. It is equipped with table and chairs and a clothes dryer (with pegs!). The cleaners are lovely and friendly and leave the rooms spotless - I have never seen such pristine white bed linen. The breakfast is plentiful and varied served by two lovely young men always smiling and cheerful. There is cheese, ham, rolls brown and white bread for toast, jams,, cereals, yoghurts, croissants and cake - fruit juices, coffee and tea etc. The bar is a nice size with seats in the sun of comfy chairs in the shade. The staff are really friendly especially Antonella who I enjoyed talking to most days.\nUnfortunately my husband took ill and we needed to call an ambulance and go to the hospital. The reception staff were superb (no help from the rep) and even though I speak Italian without their help calling emergency services and arranging a taxi for me to follow the ambulance,the situation would have been far more traumatic. They also enquired every day on my husband's condition and kept a close eye on us both.\nThis was our first visit to Sicily - how lucky were we to have booked the Baia del Sole.\nThe staff were exceptional - mille grazie - outstanding service.","41827":"Good location, right along the seafront, huge terrace, clean, helpful staff, catered to my gluten and lactose allergies, room was large access onto the terrace, close to square, marina and shops. It truly is a little off season gem.","41828":"Overlooking a beautiful sandy beach in the centre of this attractive seaside town.\nSeaview rooms open onto generous terraces.Hotel is pleasant and low key with good sized rooms and avery pleasant breakfast next to the swimming pool.","41833":"We enjoyed stay here in this beautiful small hotel just one night front beach room,the staff were always helpful and kind with us. The room are spacious with comfortable matress and pillows.We would like to came back soon.","41837":"Good size, clean, and well outfitted room. Very short walk to central piazza of town, lots of restaurants and a nice beach. Town is not as \u201ctouristy\u201d as others in Sicily giving you a better feel for Sicily. Nice town, glad we stopped here. Staff was very friendly!","41845":"Clean, friendly, the overnight staff let me in at 3am (very long drive from Palmero airport) with a smile, breakfast was very good quality with lots of choice, all good!\nWill definitely use this hotel again!","41862":"The Miramare is a comfortable, modern hotel in an ideal situation, being very close to the centre of town yet just across the road (one way) from the beach.\nOur room had the large shared balcony and though the weather did not allow us to sit out much, when we did we did not feel there was a lack of privacy.\nIn early October there was plenty of free parking on the road just outside the entrance.\nThe breakfast room overlooking the pool was slightly crowed if many guests arrived at the same time. However the choice of the usual fruit, pastries, toast etc. was good and cappuccinos were easily re-ordered.\nDid not use the very large dining room in the evening but for dinner would recommend Il Delfino. About a ten minute walk along the main road away from the town centre-good choice of seafood-filled up quickly at 7:30pm and probably need to book at weekends and high season.\nFor lunch we always went to Sicilis little corner establishment just off the main square.\nThe owner is only too delighted to discuss and explain his wide range of delicious local snacks. The place is quite correctly highly rated in TripAdvisor above many of the larger restaurants.\nMy wife had five large prawns freshly cooked in tempura batter for 5 euros.\nThe same number of smaller prawns in a wine sauce but on a plate with knife and fork cost 22 euros in one of those larger places !\nMarina di Ragusa is a good base for Montalbano coastal location driving. Not always well signposted so worth programming the satnav before leaving home\nWe found our room to be clean, spacious with a comfortable bed and good air conditioning. The shower was great, large and as powerful as needed.\nOne slight word of warning.\nThe steps of the stairs are highly polished marble and if wet would seem to be very slippery--there is a lift if concerned.\nAll the staff were helpful and we would return to this hotel very happily.","41863":"Sorry but I honestly did not rate this hotel. Location is great, however for the price paid I was not overalls impressed. Room was basic and reminded me of a premier inn . Quilt with no cover - really ! Our room was above local supermarket and sitting on your balcony with a large lorrys engine running wasn't the kind of air I was expecting to breath in . Breakfast pot of tea with a saucer as a lid and a chip in the spout is not what I would expect of a 4 star. This is a not above a 3 star. I wasn't keen on the area either it was a very busy seaside with not so much charm. However Luca was exceptionally friendly and helpful so he would rate a 5 star.","41893":"If you like a white sandy beach, gently shelving into warm sea, this is for you. The hotel is just across the road and also has its own pool. Very nice, friendly staff and a wonderful breakfast of local pastries, breads and cheeses. Great walks along the promenade to the yacht haven or in the opposite direction to the end of the town. We very much enjoyed the four nights we stayed at the Miramare.","41914":"I have rarely been made to feel so welcome as I have by the friendly and helpful staff of this wonderful hotel . The building is full of character and located in an excellent position from which to explore Ragusa Ibla. A jewel in this amazing city.","41915":"Very cool hotel - staircase was original from 13th century!! Very cool & comfortable. Perfect location to explore Ragusa on foot. Staff, especially Martina, are excellent!! Nice breakfast. The restaurant, a short walk, was AMAZING!!!!\nSorry it took me so long to write review.\nFood in Ragusa was the BEST of anywhere else we traveled to in Sicily!\nYou have to make a stop here!\nThey film the Young Montalbano here too.","41917":"We picked this hotel after reading about their restaurant and looking at the photos on their website. While we enjoyed our stay there, I'm not sure if I would stay there again if we were to visit the area. Why?\n\n1) Be aware that the restaurant and the hotel are not in the same location. The restaurant (HIGHLY recommended!) is down the hill from the hotel. I picked the hotel thinking they would be physically attached. We could have stayed at another hotel and just gone to dinner there\n2) Parking and getting there is kind of a pain, even for Sicily standards. We stayed here while driving around Sicily during a two week road trip. While we managed to find the hotel after calling them, it's a bit tricky (tight left hand turn from a Piazza to a one way street).\n3) If you have physical disabilities, this hotel is NOT for you. Our room was 30 meters or so from the main reception area up a flight of steps. We're lucky that the three of use that were traveling were all in good shape. Another couple that we ran into also was a bit shocked about the climb they had to get to their room. Europe and Italy are generally not as disability friendly as other countries but this seemed particularly tough for a \"top notch\" hotel.\n4) Breakfast was decent but the staff in the AM wasn't particularly friendly (for example nobody asked us if we wanted coffee when we arrived). This was a bit strange to us as the staff in the restaurant was great.\n5) They do have someone to help with parking but depending on when you need your car, you may have to go find it and get it yourself. We had to get going early on our departure which required us to tell the front desk since they didn't have anyone there to pull up our car. Again, I can see this for a B&B or small hotel but not for a hotel of this caliber.\n6) staff in general was not as helpful as I would expect. For example, as we were checking out we had to move a bags to the car that we pulled up. We were traveling with my 78 year old mother in law who had her bags. As we were struggling to get the bags in the car while holding up traffic on a small one way street, the receptionist just sat behind the desk. We compared this to when we checked into our Best Western in Rome the the receptionist jumped up to help us even when we didn't really need help.\n\n7) the rooms were quiet and comfortable. Ours had a tub upstairs which looked great but the steps getting up there were insane (and we're very physically active with doing long trail runs!)\n\nI think all of this would be been OK had we not been staying at a top notch Relais and Chateaux hotel that advertises access for disabled people and valet parking. Compared to other hotels in this group, the service here just didn't seem up to our expectations.","41918":"Nicely renovated rooms, good bathrooms, pleasant staff. Very small breakfast area. Location at the edge of the old town, 10 minute walk to centre of town. 10 minute walk to their restaurant.\nNo car parking nearby, although the staff were happy to park your car somewhere. Ok if you\u2019re in a hire car....","41920":"We\u2019ve just returned from a 2 week stay in Sicily. We stayed at Locanda Don Serafino on the advice of a friend who is very well travelled and honestly he always stays in the best - of which are never affordable. When we booked Ragusa we looked at the various options in rooms, prices and pictures from the hotel and travelers.\n\nWe were firstly pleasantly appreciative of the affordable prices for this fine boutique hotel. We chose to stay in a Experience Junior Suite\n\nWe were NOT disappointed. We loved the hotel. We loved the staff and the room. It was all as expected. The staff were super attentive to all our needs. They suggested and booked ( for free) trips to the beach etc. They helped us in the parking which as an American can be a challenge\n\nRemember that Ragusa Ibla is the old historic Ragusa steeped in history and maintaining that history. Our room opened onto one of the old streets and it was fantastic. It was a 5 min walk to the city center\n\nOur room. Fabulous. It was bigger than others we had experienced in Sicily and I wanted the \"cave\" experience. It was air conditioned, quiet and well appointed. There was ample room for 4 suitcases of belongings. The bathroom was perfect with the shower. And I don't know how they do it but Everytime we left we came back to the room picked up, coffee cups replaced and the area picked up. This occurred more than. Once a day!\n\nWe enjoyed our stay so much that we canceled another booking to stay an extra day. It was welcomed for the relaxation this hotel afforded\n\nThe breakfast was ample with an assortment of meat, cheeses, vegetables , breads, jams and pastries. And freshly made coffee drinks. Not just a liter of old coffee. They made it fresh for you right there. Lastly the tables already had all silverware - most places want you to get your own setting and choose a place.\n\nI highly recommend Locanda Don Serafino and we will be back. I believe we booked via the hotel as we like to ensure everything goes smoothly. ( we did take advantage of the Michelin 2 star restaurant- incredible experience and memorable. Again our attentive staff booked it and relayed allergies and every member of the wait staff to the chef who was amazing)\n\nThank you again!!","41921":"We had room #9 which you entered from the street. I thought it would be noisy but it was fine, however it was early May and there weren't may people out and about. The room was just ok. Wifi was a bit spotty at times.There wasn't a lot of room but it was adequate and clean. The bathroom however was another story. It was a small disabled bathroom, so the toilet was high and the shower stall, already small, was even made smaller with the disabled seat in it.\nThe location was good but I do think parking may be hard to find once all the people start up.\nStaff were nice and the service they provided was very professional and helpful.\nWould I stay again? Maybe if I was guaranteed another room. Would I recommend? Maybe.","41924":"In early May, we spent a couple of days in this small boutique hotel. It is ideally located in the beautiful Ibla old town district. You are in short and easy walking distance (pedestrian area) to the major points of interest.\n\nThe hotel is small, but well equipped. The breakfast is very nice and generous. They don\u2019t seem to serve further meals \u2026, of course, the fabulous 2-starred restaurant is just a couple of minutes\u2019 walk away.\n\nThe personnel is really very kind and always helpful. They take care of the car. Wifi is included and works well.\n\nWe enjoyed our stay very much and will come back.","41925":"I am here with a small tour group. Everyone is happy with the luxurious accommodations. Since it is a historic property, the rooms are not all the same. The staff is helpful. The location is excellent. And the breakfast was quite good. The beds are really comfortable!","41927":"First of all: if you are a family and need two rooms close to each other......forget it, chances are your kids will probably have to cross a road to come to you in the middle of the night. Yes, because this is what the hotel\u2019s definition of \u201cadjacent\u201d is. The rooms: as much as i may enjoy looking at an arc in the room.....i didn\u2019t necessarily enjoy the powder falling out from it into my suitcase during the night. No kitchen, therefore no room service, nor any type of food during the day nor warm food for breakfast (and hurry up, if you wake up late there are no croissants either). Personnel: not the usual polite and joyful service you would be used to in a wonderful region like Sicily, quite the opposite. Ah, and avoid the master room: built into a cave, no window, you barely breath there and the smell is very strong (+ the noise considering that it needs to have a humidifier going all day and all night). The only negative note in an otherwise wonderful tour.","41928":"We stopped over to Locanda Don Serafino just for a night.\nThe receptionist Martina was very helpful in assisting us with directions from the Ferry to the hotel, we asked to book a restaurant in town but it was closed and we ended up in the hotel owned stunning two Michelin star restaurant.\nThe setting of the restaurant are absolutely fabulous, it was like the most beautifully decorated grotto with fabulous pieces of furniture and smartly dressed waiters and maitre d, great food and wines.\nThe MAESTRO Sommelier Carmelo Di Pasquale made our dinner even more fun as he introduced us to delicious wines and took us to visit the treasure like wine cellar.\nAwesome experience.\nBack to the hotel we had room 4 and 7, rooms cute and comfortable we coffee facilities in them.\nThe staff was absolutely perfect.\nNice breakfast and a beautiful walk into Ragusa completed the departure morning.\nJob well done","41930":"The suite above the restaurant was the most unique and fabulous experience of all the travel and boutique hotels I have visited in 30 years. You climb several flights of outdoor stairs from the street, and then enter a single door to a cave\u2014truly a deep cave with a sitting area, steps into the ground for a sunken bath, separate showers and bed. We had Prosecco, fruit, and a white table cloth set upon arrival, candles throughout, and beautiful up-lighting for the walls. Proceed up another flight of stairs, and we had an outdoor sitting area with a sunken hot tub, surrounded by lemon trees.\n\nAll of this was entirely ours, as this room was not physically connected to the hotel. It was 1-2 miles away, and actually near the restaurant. At first this was odd\u2014if we needed something I would walk into a 2 star restaurant. Yet very quickly we adjusted to a full resort just for ourselves.\n\nThis meant that breakfast was in the caves of the restaurant, just the two of us and the staff. We had a private entrance to the restaurant, and during dinner we had an elevated, special table.\n\nThe food, service, recommendations, and ambience was exceptional. Thank you, Fabio (GM of the restaurant), for your team\u2019s support and your recommendations for Siracusa and Marzamemi.","41933":"This hotel is full of character with stone walls and vaulted stone ceilings . A very steep 14C staircase took us to the first floor and our beautiful ,large bedroom. We were made to feel so very welcome and have rarely met such kind and helpful staff. A very special experience .","41935":"Ragusa is a beautiful, picturesque hillside town on the Southern end of Sicily. We easily walked from one end of town to the other in half a day. On the far end of town is quaint park that has gorgeous views. In the center is the doumo which is worth a visit. Only the only evening in Ragusa, we stayed at Locando Don Serafino and ate at their restaurant. The restaurant is not part of the hotel, but a short walk away. It is actual built into the hillside and has a cave-like feel (although beautiful decorated cave). The food was absolutely delicious. We have the 9 course meal, and we ordered wine separately. Their wine cellar is amazing. Wine from all over the world and some really old vintages. They offered us a tour of the cellar after our meal. We highly recommend Ragusa for a visit if you're traveling to Sicily and please stay at the Locando Don Serafino.","41939":"Way overrated. We travel a lot and frequent Relais and Chateau properties as well as Michelin starred restaurants.\nThis place is by far the worst Relais property we have visited, it really should not be one at all.\nThe room is attractive but impaired functionally in many ways by the improvements made by the owner.\nHousekeeping is infrequent and not of good quality. The hotel does not disclose access issues such as excessive stairs. One room has over 65 outside stairs from street level, many without a railing. This is not caused by the historic property but property maintenance and operation.\nThe restaurant staff is polite and attentive with good language skills. The restaurant is very attractive, that is the end of the good news.\nThe food and restaurant are way short of Michelin standards. This may be the worst Michelin Star restaurant in the world. But it is a TWO STAR, HOW COULD THAT BE POSSIBLE. Perhaps Sicily is a complex place.\n\nNo reason to go here.","41940":"When I booked this hotel it was because the property looked terrific. I was so happy to have stayed here in the charming area of Ragusa Ibla. The staff were terrific and so helpful. Meandering up the Via Febbraio i missed the doorway and called reception for help...Help was on its way and nicest young man drove my car to parking which meant he had to take the long route around the town!.The charm of Ragusa is endless and the hotel is a dream. The appointments of the room were splendid and scrumptious breakfast was fuel for the day ahead.\nThank you to the wonderful reception and pleasant visit!","41941":"1st of all disregard any negative feedbacks on this place.... this restaurant needs to be experienced....For my wife\u2019s birthday we decided to celebrate in a special place and Locanda Don Serafino ticked all the boxes and went beyond our expectations. They gave us the best table in the restaurant with the amazing view of the cave, the place is just something you want to experience ... it\u2019s just special... the food was amazing, and the staff took a great care of us. For starter we had the \u201cCrudita\u2019\u201d which is a selection of raw fish and out of the 5 pieces 3 had the wow factor ( the oyster marinated with the granita of distilled apple, the Mazzara del vallo prawn with stracciatella and the cucumber raviolo filled with crayfish) and the remaining 2 we\u2019re supporting the great balance of a very well thought and designed dish.I had the slow cooked beef with mozzarella di Bufala foam on a red tomato reduction spiral... TO DIE FOR!!!... just amazing...for Main my wife and I had the risotto with Safran, crayfish and Sicilian truffle (min 2 people)...the rise was perfectly cooked and you could taste each single grain of rise, i after discovered that is a special type of rise which is aged for 10 moths to reach the right consistency to allow such a peculiarity...This was probably the best risotto we ever had and we are from The north of Italy the land of Risotto... the crayfish was cooked in such a way that it was perfectly balanced with the risotto and NOT mixed with it, which I think is the best way to preserve the freshness and fragrance of the fish....the generous grated portion of Sicilian Truffle gave the final touch to it.... the patisserie of the Locanda also prepared a mini birthday cake for my wife ( delicious) and the floor manager offered us a glass of one of the special local desert wines ... just amazing!!!i have forgotten to mention the Antre du Chef but I can\u2019t just remember it... so much going on ... it was a memorable experience. Thank you to the staff and the talented chef and people working in the kitchen,\nIt has been an amazing evening.","41942":"Nice hotel. Good location. The staff were very helpful and parked our car for us. Stairs to our room were very steep and quite scary. Buffet breakfast good but nothing hot.\nThe 2 star restaurant was a major disappointment. We had a fabulous lunch at Duomo. A much better option.","41944":"We have stayed at a number of high end hotels in Sicily and this has been one of the best! It certainly had the celebration feel we were looking for. Valet parking, a massive bathtub in a cave, a bottle of prosecco on arrival, super friendly staff, delicious breakfast spread. Very romantic ambience. The only con was that the room was dark and practically windowless, but it\u2019s an inevitable part of the cave-like experience and your are in the center of the old town, so it was not a bother for us. Highly recommended experience!","41945":"Fabulous hotel. We stayed in the most wonderful room, carved out of the rock, very atmospheric and romantic. The highlight however is the sublime restaurant. It has 2 Michelin stars but in my opinion deserves a third, it is quite superb.","41946":"This is a very unique and original hotel. I loved it and it's location is great. The room was very clean and very charming and has lots of nice details. Since it's built in such an old building they did what they could and did a great job but our shower was a bit uncomfortable and I could imagine that for big and tall people this hotel might not be so confortable. I personally loved it and I would definitely be happy to stay there again.","41953":"Have stayed at quite a few R&C properties and don't know how this hotel made the cut. It's not easy to get to by car because of the narrow one way streets. (The hotel staff did park our car for us and got us headed in the right direction when we left.)\n\nTo get to the rooms you have to climb a precarious stairway hewn out of rock. Looks interesting and historic but it's an accident (and lawsuit) waiting to happen.\n\nMy college dorm room was larger and better furnished than our room. The bathroom was so small two people could barely fit in it at once, and the toilet was nestled in an alcove that prevented my husband from being able to stand at it! (If you are over 5'4\" you'll bang your head if you stand straight up from sitting on the throne.)\n\nThe staff was pleasant. Breakfast was okay; focus was more on sweets like cakes, tarts and pastries.\n\nI can understand why many other hotels in Ragusa are ranked higher. Do yourself a favor and stay at one of them instead of here. We wish we had.","41955":"Unsure about the other negative reviews. We pulled up in our car and immediately someone was there too greet us and park the car. If you want to see Sicily go to Ragusa It is out of the way and you feel as if you gone back hundreds of years. The streets are small and can be difficult to drive but the step back in time is worth it.","41958":"Pros\n- Very friendly and helpful staff\n- Good breakfast\n- Large cave like room\n- Great location\n- Nice common sitting area\n\nCons\n- Room smelt musty\n- Lots of street noise\n- The website is a bit misleading - they actually have two sites and only one site has access to the jacuzzi\n- Our room was advertised as having a bath only (room 8), so I understand that\u2019s what we got, but really not sure why they couldn\u2019t add a shower head over the bath","41963":"As soon as we saw the photos of Locanda Don Serafino, we knew we wanted to stay here. It is located in Ragusa Ibla, the Old Town and is a small, personable and charming hotel.\n\nWe had no difficulty reaching the hotel. Staff sent exact directions for our drive and after a call to the front desk when we were a few minutes away, they met us and directed us to the front door. They parked our car for free, something in Sicily you learn to appreciate, and took our luggage to our room.\n\nAll staff were professional and friendly and there to help with maps, restaurant suggestions and all our needs. A lightbulb was required in one of our lamps and it was taken care of immediately.\n\nThe stairs to the room looked challenging but we managed them fine. This was the history and charm we were looking for. There is a street side door option instead but we never used it.\nThe bed linens were very fine and the towels large and soft. After long days walking the tub was appreciated.\n\nBreakfast was laid out beautifully each morning with many choices of fruit, yogurt, breads, cakes, meats, cheeses, hard boiled eggs, local jams, oils, juices. Service was friendly and proper\nThe hotel is a five minute walk to the Duomo and piazza where shops and restaurants are plentiful for variety.\n\nWe recommend a stay here. It really was a treat.","41965":"Lets start with the high points of this hotel. BREAKFAST! The food for breakfast was nicely presented and full of flavors in the charming and small breakfast area. The service of the hotel is attentive.\n\nWe did not give a 5 star rating as their were small things wrong. A running toilet, challenging stairs to get up and down (but they carried our luggage for us - a real necessity), TINY shower (if you are a larger person - it will be a challenge to get in and out). However, the room was of the highest quality - sheets so soft.","41968":"The place is very small ,located in the old city a little difficult to reach by car.If you have walking problems this is not a place for you.\nThe personal is very nice and helpful.\nYou have a very very difficult old staircase.It is very nice and authentic but in my view this is almost unacceptable for Hotel guests.\nThe rooms were nice,stylish and modern.","41986":"Having spent 11 days in Sicily based at the Parco Cavalonga I can, without any hesitation, thoroughly recommend it. Set in the countryside 3km from Donnafugata Castle it is a wonderfully peaceful hotel and self catering complex set in an old farm. We stayed in one of the self catering houses and enjoyed two bedrooms with en suite facilities, a kitchen diner area, sitting room and two courtyard areas with an upstairs veranda too. The kitchen was well stocked with washing machine (essential for the baby clothes for our grandson), cooker and fridge-freezer and the bathrooms were modern. We enjoyed three evening meals on the veranda of the main house and can recommend the cooking and ambience. We only used one of the two swimming pools but loved it, it was clean and well maintained, as was the rest of the complex. There was easy road access to the south eastern sights and Etna was 2.5 hrs away as was the valley of the temples, you will need a hire car, there are no bus services. You are 20 mins from some great beaches too. There is free wifi, it was patchy at best but sufficient for occasional usage.\n\nIn summary a traditional Sicilian farm converted into a very comfortable and well run hotel and holiday home complex. It is on a slope and would be a challenge for the less able to get around particularly if wheel chair bound. Great staff without exception. One recommendation; it would be great to have a bbq provided in the main courtyard.","41988":"This is the best Place around the Ragusa Province Hills, very close to Donna Fugata Castle and CoastSide Panoramic View. Very good Accomodation, good organization even in the middle of August Month. Fresh and countryside atmosphere, many thanks","41989":"A recommendation from a friend familiar with Sicily. Our apartment (Ibla) perfect for a family of 6, three good en-suite bedrooms, adequately furnished, clean and modern plus a well equipped kitchen for self catering. Staff friendly and helpful, location calm and relaxing. Only had one breakfast and lunch in hotel both disappointingly average. Pools very pleasant but shortage of loungers, shade and parasol's, latter very old, broken and dangerous as prone to blowing about in a modest gust. Some investment needed to warrant a return.","41992":"I found this hotel on web and it was better than I imagined: quite and clean room, two swimming pools, charming ambiance, friendly staff, good breakfast, and, last but not least, large and confortable bathroom!","41993":"This hotel is set in the middle of the countryside so you definitely need a car. Masses of wildlife - lizards, birds, butterflies and even a couple of snakes! There are a mixture of hotel rooms and self catered apartments. It was extremely hot when we were there, in the high 30\u2019s. There is an efficient air conditioning unit in the room although it is quite loud and when it turns on can be a little disturbing until you get used to it. We had a large room with reasonably basic amenities and a balcony area overlooking the garden. The bed was very hard! We asked for a topper for the mattress after the first night which helped a little. There are two lovely swimming pools and there are a few basic loungers and chairs. Swimming towels are provided in the rooms. Due to the amount of wildlife, there was quite a bit of bird poo in the bottom of the pool, but the water was quite highly chlorinated. One pool was shut at 5pm one evening we were there as there was a party.\nWe had dinner at the hotel one night - very pleasant although quite pricey at Euros30 per head for the meal we were given (no choice although alternatives could be requested in advance). Dinner is served at 8pm for all guests.\nBreakfast was served from 8.30am which was a reasonably late start for those wanting to get out early to avoid the heat. It was quite basic with cold meats and cheese, fruit, cereal etc.\nStaff were very pleasant and helpful.","41996":"Gabriella and the team were excellent. We found all the staff extremely helpful and friendly and were very amenable in all aspects of our stay.\nMy husband is gluten free and they ensured that all meals were prepared in accordance with his diet. The evening meals were delicious and some of the nicest food we had in our two weeks away.\nWell done to all. Only negative point would be to ensure that the two dogs that kept returning to property are dealt with.","41997":"We visited Relais Parco Cavalonga in early June with our 7 month old little girl. The hotel is in a rustic location with beautiful views down the valley.\n\nThe room was clean although we sadly weren\u2019t given a room with a view and instead had an outdoor seating area. They did also provide a cot for us which was great.\n\nWe visited in early season and could tell they were setting up for peak season so some things like the pool bar weren\u2019t open yet.\n\nThe staff are really friendly and always on hand to help. Gabriella in particular was great at giving some lovely restaurant recommendations.\n\nWe are in the restaurant one evening. The food was good but we did expect it to be open more than only 4 days a week as there are very few restaurants nearby. We were a bit limited how far we could drive for dinner as we needed to put our baby to bed quite early in the evenings. Most good places were 20-30 mins drive away.\n\nOverall we would recommend Relais Parco Cavalogna and it\u2019s in good proximity for visiting lots of places in Val di Noto.","42003":"Out of town. Really peaceful with friendly helpful staff. A big room with great views.\nNeed a car but worth it for the peace and quiet. Restaurant is good in the evenings and at E30\/head reasonable value\nHighly recommended!","42019":"A lovely break in mid June. Staff were lovely, room very comfortable and large.\nThe grounds and pool were well maintained and very relaxing.\nThe best thing? Dinner!!!! Great value, good food and staff who knew their business and knew their wines which were superb.\nThank you","42021":"The room was very spacious with a separate dressing !, large bathroom, terrace; everything clean. Very good breakfast, we had every evening an excellent menu; good choice of local wines for a good price. The staff is friendly and helpfull. Because of a delay of our flight we arrived arround 22.00 pm and the full menu was served without a problem !!!","42024":"We had a fantastic time chilling out at Relais Parco Cavalonga. The food is excellent, the local wines are outstanding and the service is friendly and fun, if a little chaotic at times. The rooms are big and the surroundings are wonderful. And the whole place is excellent value for money.","42025":"Appartment was roomy (2 large bedrooms with 2 bathrooms) and clean. The two pools on site are nice. Breakfast was very good. A car is definitely required to get around as the nearest restaurant is at leat 5 km away.","42027":"We planned to stay for two nights but loved the place so much that we stayed longer. From the moment we arrived, to a very warm welcome, we felt at home. This is a truly lovely place, quiet, relaxing, surrounded by lovely countryside, the sound of birds and scent of flowers and wild herbs. The staff are so friendly and helpful, the rooms large and comfortable, the food at both breakfast and dinner wonderful. It was a treat staying here and we would love to return. Great location if you like peace and quiet and simple good quality. Easy to get to so many lovely places too. A perfect holiday stay.","42029":"Room in the main building was basic but comfortable. the view down the valley ws typical of the countryside in the area. It was quiet. Food fine - only one night in. Staff pleasant. Wi-fi a bit dodgy.\nGood base for the golf at Donnafugata if you don't want to stay in their resort (which I wouldn't)\nHad i stayed longer, i would have asked for a room with a balcony.","42030":"We stayed there a family of four in 2 connected rooms. The place is beautiful, super quiet and peaceful, with modern spacious rooms, great country views, comfy beds, friendly staff and excellent diverse breakfast.","42065":"The location is outside the center, just on the exit of the main road. The hotel is suitable for people with a car; I can't imagine how to get there without a vehicle. We choose this place because we've rented a car, and there's indeed big parking outside.\n\nThe room was spacious with a few old furniture \u2014 free wifi, as well as refrigerator and television. We visited Sicily in November with cold nights, and the heater in the room was a big help.\nThe bathroom was okay, simple with plenty of lights.\nA small buffet breakfast serves in the morning. Typical Italian breakfast with many sweets.","42068":"Everything was excellent....as before! It's a pleasure to come back here again. Room very quiet, clean and comfortable, breakfast very rich and tasty also with typical local products, open swimming pool with beautiful view, very relaxing countryside atmosphere, very good service. Strategic position at few minutes driving to the historical cities of Ragusa, Ibla, Modica, Scicli and to the beach of Marina di Ragusa,","42072":"We were in one of the apartments, separated from the hotel like 200 meters. Absolutely quiet and with a fantastic view of the valley. We could comfortably sleep with any kind of noise. Very clean and everything very new, in the apartment and in the hotel. The breakfast was awesome and plenty of things from the region. People from the staff very nice and helpful. Nice swimingpool.","42073":"We thoroughly enjoyed this renovated farm outin the countryside near Ragusa. Our room on the first floor was spacious and bright with 2 balconies. The infinitypiol pool was fabulous- go there in the morning for a peaceful swim. Alessandra at reception was very welcoming and helpful. Breakfast was good with lots of choice. The only thing we missed was tea\/coffee making faculty on the room. We did ask for hot water from reception and made our own in the afternoon. The big disadvantage was having to drive out to find restaurants but we did order pizzas from reception one night","42088":"We have been lucky to find a room free in this amazing place, located in the middle of the fields behind Ragusa. Be there was one of the best choices ever. Everything we saw in the advices of its website was true or better. The room, wide, full furnished as the bathroom, the breakfast area, placed in former old stable with old stuff inside, where we started in right way our days with many delicious different choices of local goods. Then the pool, we were stoked, so wide and with sunbeds well placed to enjoy the view of the neighbor area and sea as well. What add more, the kindness and profesionality of the staff.","42090":"I enjoyed a lot my stay at this place.Very nice location, old renovated farm, with beautiful garden and swimming pool.The staff was very kind and professional.Very good breakfast, with a great choice of dishes.","42094":"Pulling into the driveway at La Dimora Di Spartivento will take your breath away. Olive trees, rosemary and lavender bushes and beautifully maintained rock work set the scene for a fabulous stay.\n\nRoom was large and in excellent condition and featured a king size bed, modern bathroom and TV with satellite channels.\n\nThe property is at the halfway point between Modica and Ragusa and is an excellent base to explore the region. Perched on the side of a cliff you look over Modica and from the infinity pool you will feel you\u2019re hovering in the air.\n\nThe included breakfast consisted of a huge range of pastries, cheese and cured meats. Parking is free and plentiful (outside) onsite.\n\nAbsolutely recommend and wish we could have stayed longer and lay by the pool and take in the incredible views.","42096":"Nice place for a night but has not so much atmosphere and close to a busy traffic road. Breakfast however is very nice here and you can also order food from a nearby restaurant and eat it outside at the terrace.","42114":"Most people complained about the road noise but we did not feel it. May be the bushes are grown high in early June! Huh! The rooms are very simple but roomy. Some rooms does not have any window but you are not going to need one if you are visiting Ragusa. The landscape, plants, view, pool and the open lounge area outside the breakfast room were the highlights. Great front office that speak English and can recommend good restaurants with friendly employees. Excellent breakfast choices and helpful understanding and hospitable crew members you may not find elsewhere in Italy. These people are not rude and yelling to the tourists like we have experienced in most of Italy.","42117":"Beautiful restored stone country home. Received an upgrade to an upstairs room with balcony overlooking the country side. Fantastic room and great balcony to enjoy our food and wine that we bought in Ragusa. Pool is superb with a great view.","42119":"We stayed one night at La Dimora di Spartivento in Ragusa. Finding it was beyond TomTom's capabilities as there is not a street address but rather route number and kilometer markers. We drove all around, stopping to ask locals several times and it was getting way past check in time so a very kind gentleman called the hotel to let them know we were lost and on our way and then drove us to the right marker on the highway. Once we arrived, the staff was friendly and helpful, our room was very nice, spacious, immaculate and comfortable. The grounds are lovely, the hotel buildings are architecturally very pleasing. Free parking on site, free WIFI and breakfast. Breakfast was quite good with ample choices. The hotel offers numerous spa services and would make a nice weekend getaway if you have transportation and a good sense of direction!","42121":"We stayed here for 4 nights and had an excellent time. Its easy to find with signs from the highway and the views are truly amazing; except when we were rained in for a day and the visibility was very short.\nThe room was very comfortable and clean while the grounds are a delight to walk around.\nThe buffet breakfast was comprehensive and enjoyable - the staff was very friendly and efficient with the cappuccino(s).\nThe staff at reception were also excellent and very helpful especially as we spoke no Italian. We ordered dinner to be delivered one night from a comprehensive menu and it was a very good meal. There is no requirement to order early in the day as we didn't order until about 18;30 and we received it at the standard delivery time of 20;00.\nWe had the misfortune to leave behind a credit card and some cash and the staff went out of their way to try and contact us; they eventually did so by email ( we had our phone turned off) and then were very helpful in resolving the problem.\nOverall, we had an awesome time and all the staff went out of their way to be accommodating and helpful.","42123":"This was the 4th hotel we booked and by far the most disappointing. The room was very well appointed and the view was amazing. The buildings are very attractive and thoughtfully restored. However, the pool was filthy so we gave that a miss. The room was not at all soundproofed so we heard other guests movement which woke us up. It\u2019s not that the guests were particularly noisy, the walls must be incredibly thin. There was also road noise to contend with as it is situated on a main road. There was no recommendation from reception on evening meal options and after a 3 and a half hour drive that day the last thing I wanted to do was to have to get in the car and drive somewhere for something to eat. Maybe that was our fault for not researching the place thoroughly enough but being so remote I thought there would be some in house eating options. We found out once there that there are, but you have to eat in your room and you have to order by noon. Rather than driving into Ragusa or Modica we used trip advisor to try and find something very local - I really wish we hadn\u2019t as we got a bit lost and ended up in the middle of nowhere being overcharged for a very average pizza we could have had at pizza hut back home - unfortunately can\u2019t remember the name of it to give it a negative review. Back to the hotel & breakfast was lovely, check out straight forward. Loads of free parking. I wouldn\u2019t want to put anyone off this place but think about what you want from your overnight stay - if like us you like to leave the car parked and wander into town for a few drinks and a nice meal, you are better off elsewhere. If you are using it as somewhere to sleep before moving on and aren\u2019t too bothered about an evening out, then definitely worth considering - they have staff on overnight so I imagine late check in would not be an issue.","42125":"Excellent Accommodation for a nice short break. This was my third visit & would definitely go again. Less than 30 minutes from Pozzallo Harbour & though it\u2019s close to a main road, it is still a very peaceful place to stay. Very spacious rooms which are kept very clean. Ample parking for all the guests & a very nice breakfast. The staff are all very friendly and helpful. Would recommend to anyone any time.","42134":"This is an impeccably restored stone farmhouse with modern rooms and breathtaking views. My stay was at the end of the season so the restaurant was closed for lunch and dinner. The breakfast buffet (especially the pastries) made up for the closed cucina.\nThe courteous, friendly staff was a pleasure to work with. I will put this location on my plans for future travel to Sicilia.","42136":"Excellent Accommodation for a nice shot break. This was my third visit & would definitely go again. Less than 30 minutes from Pozzallo Harbour & though it\u2019s close to a main road, it is still a very peaceful place to stay. Very spacious rooms which are kept very clean. Ample parking for all the guests & a very nice breakfast. The staff are all very friendly and helpful. Would recommended anyone any time.","42137":"My husband, son and DIL and my sister and I stayed for ONLY one night at La Dimora di Spartivento. It was in October and the place was very quiet, so we thought we were the only ones there, but we were mistaken. This place is so people, beautifully built to last (something hotel in the states should do) and attention to detail was evident.\n\nWe were doing a tour of Sicily and only had one night at the hotel which was really too bad. It is quiet, clean, spare but in a nice way. The breakfast was really nice and there were lots of different choices. It is in a really remote place, but we walked around the property and were astonished by the pool and play area. It was stunningly beautiful. Lucky the person who get to stay there for more than one day.","42138":"Amazing and unique boutique hotel small and friendly located at the heart of the old city. Rooms a spacious with a wonderful design and authenticity especially the ceiling painting in my room.\nStaff is so helpful and friendly it was a pleasure to have breakfast and taste all of Sicily wonderful dishes, had all the patient to provide a breakfast sample with all of the local recipes and ingredients.\nLocation is a second away, the hotel owner was very kind to share some of the culture and story behind the HEADS which are everywhere.\nA must is the The espresso from Sicily somewhere.\nI am sure to come back to this hotel","42139":"This hotel was nothing short of amazing. The location was prime - set in a small alley and centrally located to all walkable attractions. Our room was HUGE - big king bed, enormous bathroom and even a little alcove with a wardrobe. The hotel, despite being at near-capacity, felt like it was all ours. Quiet, beautiful layout and a very nice breakfast the following morning. We only had interaction with 1 staff member and she was a pure delight. As previously mentioned, once we parked the car, we had no need for it during our stay as the hotel was located in the midst of everything. It sits right on the Piazza Duomo so walking to the Duomo itself, as well as the cute bars, restaurants, and the Giardino Ibleo was very easy and only enhanced our stay. I would 100% recommend a.d. 1768 again and again.","42140":"We absolutely loved our stay at ad 1768. We were truly fascinated with the love and attention to detail that is put into the place and the operation. The most lovely host welcomed us with her passion and enthusiasm for this impeccably restored 1768 palace, showing us all the original details that have carefully been restored with the modern personal touches harmoniously blended in. The beds were comfortable, the bathrooms of very high quality and spacious, and the blackouts kept noise from the main piazza away, letting us sleep peacefully. The breakfast was marvelous with so many different and high-quality options and the friendly staff was spoiling us. We also received the best restaurant and sightseeing recommendations (be sure to drive to Modica to go to Accusio bistro and have a cocktail at Azure in Ragusa). Just brilliant! We cannot wait to be back!","42142":"This was a really exceptional place to stay and a highlight of our trip to Sicily. The owners eye for detail and for history, with a great modern touch shines through. We loved our room and the common areas of the hotel. Staff were very friendly and the breakfast was great. Location in the heart of the city and easy to walk and enjoy the town.","42143":"Staying at this hotel was the highlight of our 2 week visit to Sicily. The photos on the website are true to the look and feel of the hotel and it was wonderful to have a balcony with a view of the city center. The host was extremely friendly and gracious, and do take advantage of the city tour on the Vespa Api. We are so grateful to have stayed in such a historic venue, beautifully preserved and restored.","42146":"Old building whose interior was recently renovated in ultra-modern design. Rooms are very nice with balconies overlooking main pedestrian mall.\nProblem: I was there in early November and they had turned the room cooling off, so to cool the room off at night I had to leave the door\/window open, that let noise and tobacco smoke from the street below in, which was very unpleasant. With a new renovation, why not have a mechanical system that allows on-demand cooling? In a rural location, this might be acceptable but in the middle of town, it\u2019s an issue, particularly at a \u201cluxury \u201c hotel.","42148":"I stayed in this hotel for 3 nights in room \"Donna Agnese\". Beautifully designed and decorated, the room was lovely. The hotel is so pretty without being fussy. A wonderful mix of original stone ceilings\/walls\/floors with new floors that blend with the style. Quirky art, very comfortable bed and pillows, extremely clean - the hotel is brand new.\n\nThe owner is so nice and helpful at providing suggestions for where to eat and assisting in making dinner reservations. She took time to sit down with me to explain a map of where I should visit in Ragusa, which was so hospitable and unexpected.\n\nThe hotel is perfectly located, on a side street off of Piazza Duomo. You can spend an early evening here, people watching while sipping an aperol spritz. Also walking distance from the community garden and from Ragusa Superiore, where you can have the most beautiful view back down to Ragusa Ibla.","42149":"After reading about a.d 1768 and seeing these reviews, we were a little excited about this hotel located in a prime position in the heart of Ragusa. However, when we visited the hotel to enquire about booking for a weekend for us and our friends as a bit of a group get away, we were greeted with great hostility. To my surprise, the receptionist was so hostile that I couldn\u2019t speak and I was lost for words. For a minute I was trying to work out if she had confused us with someone as I just couldn\u2019t imagine anyone speaking to us this way. I looked over at my husband, and could tell he was thinking the same thing. Instead of trying to explain why we were there, my husband just took my hand and politely said that we were leaving and we smiled and left. Strangely, as we walked down the street, I reflected on all the places we have visited and all the hotels we\u2019ve stayed in and feel I\u2019ve never been greeted in such a manner nor encountered such rudeness such as this. The paying guests writing reviews are obviously getting one side of a face which seems to have two sides. No matter the circumstances, it pays to be polite. You just never know.","42152":"What make this place great is just not beautiful architecture and unmatched interiors, but more importantly, People. Jucy, owner of the hotel and her team are just FABULOUS. They make all the difference. One of the best place I ever stayed. This place is must visit place if you are in Sicily. We stayed for two nights and enjoyed every bit of it.\n\nPS : A city tour in their 3 wheeler is must do!","42154":"a.d. 1768 was a lovely surprise in a charming town. Large rooms with extremely comfortable beds, state of the art amenities and clean bathrooms, we weren\u2019t left wanting. But the best thing going for the hotel was Rosella, the front desk manager who gave us spot on recommendations for dinner and what to see. Highly recommend staying here.","42158":"\u201cWe had the most marvellous stay at AD 1768, and can honestly say that we have never met such an enthusiastic hotelier. Thanks to Guilia, this wonderful old palace has been sensitively and lovingly restored - and to say that she has done a good job is a total understatement. We enjoyed the tour of the rooms and felt very special in our room with frescoes on the ceiling and a view of the Cathedral from our balcony. Many, many congratulations on your hotel - and we hope it is a commercial success for you - as it is well deserved. The breakfast was delicious and more than plenty and the coffee was one of the best we have had whilst on our trip in Sicily. Too many superlatives, you think? No way - this place is fantastic! Judith & Toby wish you well and will be back.\u201d","42197":"We are a retirement age couple, though I still work in an academic setting. We made our first trip to Sicily in May 2017. As fans of the Montalbano series, we decided to make Ragusa a base for a several nights stay and chose the Giumbabulla Luxury House. We were very pleased with the choice. Daniela was a very delightful and attentive hostess. There was fresh fruit in the room every day and the in-room breakfast was more than we could eat, even if we saved some of the pastries to take along for later in the day. The location is very convenient for those who wish to visit both Ragusa and Ragusa Ibla. A short walk in one direction leads to the piazza in front of the Cattedrale di San Giovanni Battista, where the local tourist information office is located and where there are shops and restaurants. A short walk in the other direction leads to a great spot where you get a panoramic view of Ragusa Ibla and the beginning of the steps which go down to the lower city. Walking back to the room at the end of a day we would pass a small local-owned deli where we could pick up bread and rolls, fresh ricotta, and other great ingredients to make a Sicilian picnic supper. We stayed in the Arabesque room, which has a view across some rooftops and a ravine to a hillside opposite. Ragusa is a good choice for visiting this part of Sicily as there is excellent inexpensive local bus service to Modica and Scicli. We also took a local bus one day to the small village on the seashore where the Casa di Montalbano is located. When it was time to leave Ragusa for our next stop Daniela arranged for a friend to drive us with our luggage to the long-distance bus station for our trip to Syracusa. We were very pleased overall with the location, accommodation and the friendliness and attentiveness of Daniela and would certainly recommend Giumbabulla Luxury House to others looking for a city-based Bed and Breakfast in this part of Sicily.","42228":"So very hard to find, but well worth the search. Like a paradise on earth. When we arrived, we had a short massage before being shown to our room. The room was beautiful and comfy. We went to a fantastic dinner with wine pairing. Delicious!! Breakfast was the most amazing spread we experienced in two weeks in Sicily. The next morning Angelo, the perfect host, took us through the fields to a farmhouse where we made fresh ricotta cheese and samples it fresh from the fire. Just amazing. This was our favorite stop in two weeks of Sicily travel and it is a must visit.","42229":"What a place!\nHad to drive through huge gates to get into property to what looks like a small castle.\nGreeted and spoiled from the moment we arrived.\nA nice welcome drink and a tour of the place and told about its history.\nTranquil gardens and pool.\nHad an amazing meal at their restaurant. Everything locally sourced or grown on property.\nThen breakfast! Wow!!! Extensive, fresh, amazing! I could have sat and eaten all day.\nThe staff were all incredible! Can\u2019t praise this place more than to say you must stay here!!!","42230":"One thousand and one nights: that's how long I am willing to spend in this magical domain. And I am sure that each and every one will be just as dreamy-like as the fairy tales of Scheherazade. And it will all have a happy ending, same as our stay here. I just spent two weeks in Sicily, staying in 5-star hotels, but nobody could match this enchanted experience.\nTA does not allow links, so I cannot post a link here, but type Eremo Della Jubiliana in your browser and it will take you to their web site, where you can read the history of the place, including the fact that they are probably the only hotel in Sicily with its own archaeological site!\nFrom the first moment of your arrival, when they meet you with a bubbly Welcome, through incredibly good food grown on the property, wines and olive oil of superior quality, also produced here, the magical cobblestones and the former monks' rooms, now ultimately elegant and comfortable, through the hundreds of historical details and touches all around, you will feel welcome and part of the family. The Manager, Angelo, was the personification of friendliness and efficiency. There was a storm the night of our arrival and the Internet connection was malfunctioning: I just mentioned it to Angelo and before I knew it, it was all fixed and working fine. Even the two dogs, Max and Lili, will welcome you. Breakfast was included and represented by a magnificent buffet, including Prosecco and juices from the surrounding trees. We also had excellent dinner at Don Eusebio, their restaurant (separate review).\nAs if all this weren't enough, they offer airplane rides and have a spa. This is what I hope Paradise looks like! I am definitely coming back to it.\n**","42231":"When we suddenly needed to change our travel plans during a two-week Sicilian vacation, we were fortunate, at the last minute, to be able to book two nights at the Eremo della Giubiliana.\n\nWhile this hotel may not be to everyone's taste, for us, who enjoy old-world luxury and historic properties, it was perfect.\n\nAll the staff went out of their way to make our stay pleasant. On arrival, we were seated in the living area to check-in and were given wonderful fresh almond milk, made on the premises. We were then given a tour of the property with details of its history, while our luggage was taken to our room.\n\nThe room was a bit small, but charming, and not atypical for many European luxury hotels. The furnishings were excellent, the bed very comfortable, and the bathroom very nice. We had a large patio on which to sit and sip wine at the end of the day.\n\nOthers have complained that the swimming pool was not up to par. That was not the case at all for us. It is situated in a nice garden and was clean and well attended. While the water was not heated, it was certainly warm enough for an end of the day swim.\n\nThe restaurant was delightful for breakfast and elegant for dinner. The breakfast buffet was excellent and even provided the Sicilian classic of granita with brioche! Dinner was well prepared.\n\nWe received excellent recommendations for a second dinner at Punta Secca.\n\nThe hotel is a bit hidden, but is in a good location for day trips to the baroque villages of Sicily and also for exploration of the coast.\n\nFor those who enjoy historic properties and old-world luxury I highly recommend this hotel.","42232":"Somewhat how of the way of everything .. everything .. but very good hotel. Beautiful.\n\nNice big room. Ok bathroom. Poor pool area (pool not properly heated) and\nno jacuzzi.\n\nHotel offers great sense of history and is beautiful. Great stones and wood. Magic.\n\nExcellent service.","42234":"We returned to the Eremo and Sicily after two years from our last visit and we found the Hotel even better than last time. We loved our stay and as usual, the staff really made the difference. Everyone is very accommodating and always doing anything possible to accommodate every request. The restaurant was amazing and is really the perfect base to explore the area. Amazing restaurant and breakfast buffet with local homemade products.","42238":"Absolutely fantastic stay for 3 nights. The hotel team are incredibly welcoming, knowledgeable and friendly. Impeccable service throughout, be this in the restaurant at dinner and breakfast, by the pool, or the cleaning and turn down service. Nothing was too much trouble. Great location to explore the area, but you may just not want to leave! Also highly recommend the cookery classes, we loved it and got to create a 4-course Sicilian feast over the course of 3 hours in the hotel kitchen. Plan this into your holiday, you won\u2019t regret it!","42239":"This review is long overdue. Toured all around Sicily and this hotel was our favorite. Not only a great hotel but a working farm that\u2019s steeped in history. Was at one time the headquarters of the Knights of Malta. Visited where they raise their pigs. Saw them making fresh ricotta over a fire & gathered fresh eggs which were both served for breakfast. Great restaurant. Wonderful experience. Car needed as somewhat out in the \u201ccountry\u201d","42241":"We stayed 3 nights at Eremo and used it as our base to explore Ragusa, Modica,the beaches to the south (Sampierri) and Gulfi Winery. It was a great stay and the staff at the hotel are helpful, friendly and warm.\n\nOur room was a barrel vaulted enormous room with a sitting area in addition to the bed. The bathroom is European style and functional. The food is excellent- great breakfasts and romantic outdoor candle lit dinner. The pool and garden are very pleasant and there are chaises to read and nap.\n\nOverall, while it\u2019s 20-25 mins by car from the main towns, if you want a quiet, charming and relaxing base, Eremo is a great place to stay.","42243":"This is a hotel of immense charm, history and character, and it meets its promise of five star service. However, it is not without significant quirks and in our experience these were problematic.\n\nWe stayed in a superior double room on the ground floor (15). Although small as advised at booking, it was comfortable and well appointed, and the space used effectively. Its window looks out onto the hotel\u2019s ancient fountain which was lovely. The bedding is very comfortable, there was plentiful hanging space, and the bathroom offered a deep bath. There is a reasonably priced minibar in the fridge.\n\nService was wonderful. The welcome from Marco set the scene for consistently excellent staff. The staff were not simply friendly, but highly professional and polished. On mentioning our plan for a day trip to Modica, we were offered maps, a suggested itinerary and restaurant recommendations. On sitting for drinks before dinner, Alfio quietly set a citronella candle nearby to ensure our comfort- these touches were much appreciated.\n\nThe hotel is remote. We used it as a base to explore Sciccli, Modica, Donnafugata Castle and Donnalucata. Taxis to Ragusa are 30 Euros one way if you plan on a night out (and you should, as Ragusa at night is amazing), so the hotel should only be considered by tourists with a car or deep pockets. Cost will become an issue for travellers who consider it a relatively well priced five star option as drinks, and food are very expensive. During our stay, we ended up spending 65 Euro per head a night at the restaurant, and I would consider this the absolute minimum you could spend for dinner with water (9 Euro a bottle), two courses (necessary due to small serves- mostly 20- 25 Euro) and a glass of wine (9 Euro minimum). The wine list was expensive, with the cheapest bottles starting at 35 Euro, though draught beers can be had for 5 Euro.\n\nFood standard at the hotel is high, though expensive. We had a pork cheek spaghetti (from the hotels own Sicilian pigs) and lightly seared teriyaki tuna on the first night which were perfect, though my husband did not enjoy the rooster dish. On the second night, the set menu of five mixed dishes of both fish and meat were of very high quality. The Don Eusubio restaurant is wonderfully atmospheric in the hotel\u2019s stone courtyard, with dramatic lighting and bougainvillaea. Breakfast food was of good quality, though had a fee for any freshly cooked eggs outside the very limited hot buffet- and this annoys. The hotel\u2019s own produce is emphasised for breakfast, which is an enjoyable touch.\n\nThe grounds are well maintained and full of character. The garden area is delightful, and feels like paradise, the pool is within this area and lovely, though it needs a few more lounge chairs, and the cushions to be refreshed. Pool service was attentive and polished- rare in Italy. At night, the garden area is atmospherically lit.\n\nDuring our stay in late June, the garden and pool space was plagued by a lot of flies, particularly during the daytime (it was truly terrible mid afternoon, though is better by evening). We don\u2019t point this out lightly- we are from Southern Australia and are used to flies! Two of our four pool drinks ended up having flies fall into them\u2026This problem severely compromises the ability to relax and linger in this delightful Sicilian countryside hotel- really one of the main reasons we had booked a three night stay. The problem is known to the staff, and fly traps have been set to address the problem but did not work well enough during the day, and the traps are smelly.\n\nWe decided to check out of the hotel a day early. Unfortunately, despite its great charm and wonderful service, we were not able to relax at the Eremo by the pool as we wanted, felt stifled by the cost of the restaurant and longed for the atmosphere a town. As they were unable to refund our final night, the hotel offered very generous drink service during our second dinner, and we really appreciated this. While there was true warmth from the service throughout out stay, this was much less apparent on our check out, which seemed icy, even though we thought we were leaving on good terms and without significant conflict with the hotel- this was very disappointing.\n\nWe moved to a hotel in Ragusa Ibla for our last night which was lively and exciting. The highlight for us in the Sicilian baroque towns was the evening atmosphere, and I think staying at this sophisticated hotel really limited our exposure to this.","42249":"The classic rooms are to small for a five stars hotel. Shower means the bathroom is under water. It was until midnight very loud because of the kitchen activities.\nExtremly nice an professional staff. Fantastic restaurant.","42250":"On out Sicily round trip we rtayed for 4 nights at this tremendous place. The hotel is located in a old monastery building, located 6 miles outside of the town of Ragusa.\nThe hotel has a excellent restaurant offerimg local and international specialities.\n.","42255":"This is the second time I have stayed at the Eremo della Giubiliana and I can't wait to go back. The location is perfect for visiting Ragusa, Modica, Moto, Marina di Ragusa and Scicli. The staff is wonderful and accommodating. The breakfast outstanding. Very elegant, quiet and the bathrobes are the best. My entire family loved staying here. Many thanks to everyone at the Eremo.","42256":"Stayed at Eremo della Giubiliana for four nights in the summer month of August with my partner\u2019s family. Being a hotel professional in various luxury hotels, I am not a fan of writing bad reviews as being in the same line of work, I have always empathised with my fellow professionals. However, my experience at the hotel deserve such effort as a luxury five-star hotel.\n\nLocation of Eremo della Giubiliana is in the deserted heartland of Ragusa which require 20 minutes\u2019 drive to the downtown and its beach. The hotel qualifies all the 5 stars luxury requirements but may not exceed the standard of such products (e.g. small swimming pool, limited service spa, etc.).\n\nFirst and foremost, we were warmly welcomed upon arrival by the manager named Leonardo. He has kindly gone through a brief introduction and check-in formalities with us but unfortunately lacks eye contact with me throughout the process which were in fact, have been consistently proven during the rest of my stay.\n\nWe were then assigned and escorted to the cottage which is located on the hotel\u2019s private airfield (existed since\/before WW2) and require us to take at least 5 minutes in our personal car to commute. Although bicycles are provided, it is highly recommended that the cottages should be equipped with bungy car to complement the hotel\u2019s standard whilst minimising the risk of accident\/unforeseen circumstances.\n\nThe rooms are indeed well equipped and spacious. However, the old model TV need to be replaced due to its small size and likewise, the air-condition system which cause loud noises while operating.\n\nOur rooms have had two consecutive days of power shutdown which took about half an hour to be rectified due to a storm. It has taken more than two days to clean and drained the small swimming pool. Although verbal apology was extended, there is no minimal service or alternative recovery were rendered for such inconvenience.\n\nBreakfast service was sincerely great and have been a highlight of our stay. My 9-year-old nephew was very attached with the service staff \u2013 Lorenzo throughout our stay due to his smile, patience and graciousness which really made us feel welcome. We also had dinner on our first and final night at the hotel\u2019s restaurant. To conclude our experience on the final night, the restaurant alfresco area is on its full occupancy and hence, it took more than 1 hour for our main food to be served (it\u2019s a big no-no for less than 5 mouthful of pasta worth EUR32). Naturally, my nephew was innocently talking rather loudly while waiting for his food which may have caused disturbance to other guests. While failing to assess the cause, Leonardo approached my nephew directly to address the issue instead of clarifying them to us as adults. Once again, embarrassment was rendered to us instead of any service or alternative recovery for the wait.\n\nWith exception of Leonardo which requires more professional training as a manager, all the hotel\u2019s service staff are friendly and professional which have made us to overlook the above experience. The pricing which we have been offered on a special deal that may be in line with the product and standard, but the hotel is of novelty value in an island which offers so much more.","42261":"I have found the hotel by chance on booking and i was so impressed that i have decided to extend my staying. Perfect location, brilliant atmosphere and sharp and focused staff makes your time at the Eremo a memory worth to be kept and repeated.","42264":"This is a truly beautiful and first rate hotel! 5 Star Luxury in fact! As you drive up the tiny country lanes across open countryside and dry stone walls, you cannot imagine finding this hotel, but find it you do and you are not disappointed! From the best welcome we have ever experienced from a hotel (staff waiting for you as soon as you enter the gates), glass of Almond milk and then a full tour of the hotel and grounds and asked to use the hotel and enjoy it \u2018as if it were your own home\u2019! The breakfast in the vaulted dining room is legendary and already well documented but we also enjoyed two evenings eating the most exquisite food in the outdoor courtyard - it was sublime! The staff are incredibly friendly and helpful and cannot do enough for you.\nWe had one classic room in the main house (a little on small side but very quiet and peaceful and convenient for everything including the pool) and as we are a family of four with two teenage children, we stayed in the cottage. This was great fun; staying on a private airfield in our own little cottage, with garden, outdoor seating and cycling to breakfast and dinner (literally 2-3 mins back to main house). It is all very close and the standard of accommodation is very high. We enjoyed having tea and coffee (and BBQ) making facilities in the cottage (not available in the classic room). All rooms have fridges though for your own drinks etc.\nThe pool is the place of dreams - walled lush garden, very pretty and a place to have pre-dinner Prosecco in the evenings (I recommend doing this, the staff make it very special and help you choose the best place to enjoy the garden and deliver the most amazing entrees! We loved it and so did our teenagers!).\nMy only small criticism is the food is amazing but be prepared to pay handsomely and the bikes whilst good need more maintenance, but there are plenty of replacements!\nThank you for such a wonderful 5 days - we all loved it!","42265":"We stayed for four nights in August with two small children.\n\nWe usually pay twice as much a night and we were amazed by the value the hotel offered.\n\nThe property is old fashioned but luxerious. The gounds are well maintained. The staff are genuinely nice, friendly and helpful. Propably some of the best we encountered. The babysitter we hired a few hours each day (Manuela) was also amazing and spoke English, which seems unusual for Sicily as all the other babysitters we met elsewhere didn\u2018t speak english at all.\n\nThe pool is on the small side but clean and very peaceful with birds, butterflies and dragonflies flying around.\n\nWe stayed in one of the cottages at the airfield and they were spacious, comfortable and very quiet. Perfect for families. I was worried about airplane noise but we didn\u2018t encounter any incoming or outgoing planes.\n\nThe breakfast was very fresh and tasty, the best of the breakfasts we had in sicily.\n\nThe location is remote but close enough to explore ragusa, modica and scicli (all under 20 minutes away). All of them are beautiful and worth an evening stroll and dinner.\n\nWe wish we had booked 7 nights here instead of 4 and would thoroughly recommend a stay here.\n\nMy only note to the owner would be to please replace the few remaining ugly blue plastic sun loungers with more stylish wooden ones that are found in most of the common areas of the hotel.","42266":"My husband and I had the privilege of spending three nights in a cottage during a holiday to Sicily recently.What a gem!\nSuch a lovely find and so well worth the adventure of staying in a rural environment where the countryside of Sicily can be fully appreciated.\nOutstanding features are numerous though,the incredible, and authentic, food on offer from the fresh and delicious breakfast to, the best antipasto lunch on arrival and beautiful dinner in the courtyard cannot be understated.The quality of the food and authentic nature is to be experienced and not missed!\nWe spent a day with the very helpful,informative and obliging Lorenzo visiting an Olive Oil processing area before a truly sumptuous lunch and informative visit to The Gulfi winery......Not to be missed.\n\nThankyou for making our holiday so special and don\u2019t change a thing......Our stay was certainly a highlight of our holiday in Sicily and we couldn\u2019t recommend a visit to Eremo Della Giubiliana if visiting Ragusa for a truly genuine Scillian experience.","42269":"Take me back a few days to this remarkable place. Staff friendly and helpful, food delicious, dining outside a real treat.. pool and surrounds so pretty.\nWe had the tower suite.. a little difficult with bags but worth the hike..","42270":"Renovated monastery. Very well done. Necropolis and turret, to boot.\nGreeted with a glass of homemade sweetened almond milk. Eccentric owner and family live on premises. He offers tours in his small plane (revamped WW II runway down the road) or his zebra-striped Land Rover).\nStaff excellent. Giuseppe very kind. Small cell rooms come with WiFi and AC but, no surprise, are cramped. Not a big deal if you are up and out most of the day. Beach, Ragusa, Villa Romana, ceramic shopping all within an hour and 15 at most.\nThe breakfast is lavish with wonderful house baked breads, tarts, rolls and cookies. Quince, zucchini and almond jams also made here. Eggs and hams, ditto. Try the brioche and almond granita. Typical breakfast in summer!\nThe dinners are excellent as well, if not pricey, and as reviewed, petite, in some cases.\nA couple of minor issues for me:\nPool is very small in a beautiful enclosed garden (old orchard) that, during our stay was visited by many flies (this is a farm, after all).\nI am not a fan of piped in scent (in AC in many places) and in this case attached to a plug, which can be removed from socket.\nOtherwise, the helpful and eager front desk and friendly waiters make this place a treasure worthy of a stay.","42274":"Our arrival at Eremo set the tone for our stay. On pressing the intercom to open the impressive gates we were directed to the reception area where we were met by a member of staff who greeted us warmly with a glass of almond milk and organised another member to unload our car and take our luggage to our room. We were then given a tour of the hotel and its facilities before being taken to our room. The staff were wonderful and a comment from the General Manager that \u201c we are all one big family\u201d certainly rang true with their approach to treating their guests. The meals are excellent, with particular emphasis on local products, are very well prepared and served. The dining room is amazing architecture. The reception staff are very helpful and knowledgably answering all our queries. We decided to take the day trip in the Land Rover with Roberto, what a gem he is. We cheekily ask to see some of the landmarks in the Inspector Montalbano series which he did with enthusiasm. He also took us to Modica and Scicili explaining all the history. As a resident of Ragusa Abla again his knowledge was amazing. His humour was infectious, although he was rather astounded when I asked for a cappuccino after of lovely lunch with him in Modica a big no no in Italy !!!!! The day was definitely a highlight of our holiday, thank you Roberto. I have to say though that all the staff are a credit to the hotel and made our stay they extremely enjoyable. Ragusa is an easy 10 min drive away park just below Ragusa Abla in the free car park, the town is well worth a visit. Good luck to the conversion of the water mills to a eco resort.","42275":"Peaceful country hotel with an exceptional team . We have been travelling for 2 months in our new Motorhome \u2018Lucky\u2019 and decided to have a few days luxury for my partners birthday . We chose a brilliant hotel , it\u2019s an old monastery that has been converted very tastefully into a lovely hotel. From arrival all the staff were very helpful, friendly and efficient. The room was quite small but had a comfy bed and a much wanted bath ! The breakfast is very tasty with lots of different local foods and foods which the hotel make themselves like quince marmalade and ricotta cheese. I was given lots of options for gluten free and de-caf coffee and tea. The dinners were exquisite , very tasty with good local wine. A lovely shady swimming pool in the gardens surrounded by almond, pistachio, lemon and orange trees. A brilliant 3 days rest and now back on the road for another month !","42276":"This interesting and historic property is impeccably managed. Deep in the seat of the Maltese Nights this place oozes masculine sober elegance. Easy drive to Scicli, Ragusa Ibla and the beach. Lunch at the restaurant Duomo in Ragusa Ibla an easy and amazing outing from here.","42277":"The grounds of the hotel are exquisite. We were in room 16 which was located in a lovely courtyard. The staff of the hotel are very friendly.\n\nBreakfast was very good.\n\nBecause the hotel is a 15-20 minute ride from Ragusa, it makes sense to eat dinner at the hotel. This was the source of a bit of disappointment. Both the outdoor and indoor seating areas are lovely. We found the food to spotty in quality. The tuna was delicious. On the other hand, the spaghetti dishes were soggy and uninspired. So were the desserts.\n\nNevertheless, this is a great place to relax and unwind.","42285":"This ex Monastery is full of peace and care, the Manager Angelo and his team do a great job in preserving the history of the place and transmitting it to the visitors.\nWe highly recommend to dine at the Eremo (they cultivate their own products) and at least two or three nights here, or longer if you wish to unplug from the day to day for some time.\nWe were nestled in this corner of heaven for too short and we will return.\nWell done","42286":"We had a blissful five-night stay at Eremo della Giubiliana at the beginning of April and we would recommend visiting Sicily in the Spring. The weather was perfect with plenty of sun during the day and light winds carrying the scent of oranges. The landscape was also particularly beautiful - very green and covered with yellow and purple wildflowers. Above all else the hotel exceeded our expectations. From the moment we arrived, late, after a very delayed flight, and were greeted with prosecco and supper laid out in our room, to our last sunny lunch in the courtyard - everything was perfect. Our room was comfortable and we loved sitting out on our terrace enjoying the birds singing in the palm trees. We also spent many dreamy hours in the pretty gardens around the pool. The staff were attentive without being over-bearing and our every need was taken care of. They suggested places to eat and booked tables and also provided maps of the local hilltop towns with highlighted suggestions of what to visit. We had a truly wonderful stay.","42290":"This is a beautiful hotel with a very cool history and lovely rooms and grounds. We had two rooms, one which was a three floor tower room with two huge terraces including one on the rooftop. The rooms were very comfortable with amazing views. The staff were very professional, helpful and friendly. Our breakfasts and one dinner at the hotel were excellent. We loved staying here and hope to return to relax and soak up the wonderful experience again!","42293":"I highly recommend eremo della gubliana. We enjoyed our time in this very special place. Rooms are comfortable food is good and the atmosphere is relaxing. Moreover, service is very welcoming and careful","42295":"We booked for 5 days on the recommendation of a friend. No disappointment at all!\nGreeted with prosecco or almond milk on arrival on a dark winter night, we never lacked for anything during our stay. The staff, especially Lorenzo and Letizia, were engaged and helpful every day with recommendations for places to see or to eat, or just to enjoy.\nThe restaurant was great every morning for breakfast and we enjoyed 3 dinners there as well. Locally raised and prepared dishes were outstanding! Wine cellar is stocked with wonderful Sicilian wines. Margharita assisted my daughter (from the States) in getting a birthday cake made for my birthday while we were there. Delicious and timely!","42296":"Our travel agents recommended this place and it is just exactly what we like. Family owned just outside of Ragusa and just beautiful. Our suite is 3 stories with two garden decks and magnificent views. The grounds are beautiful and the service and welcoming staff could not be better. We are so happy to be here.","42301":"Eremo della Giubiliana is more than a 5 star hotel, it is a historic building in a most wonderful location with service that shines above any other generic 5 start hotel you might stay at. For example it was raining one day and my shoes were covered in mud, I left them outside adn when I returned later in the day, the house keeper had cleaned them completly with out me asking. I would highly recommend this hotel.","42303":"The staff were extremely helpful, considerate & knowledgable treating us wonderfully from the glass of prosecco on arrival to answering our many queries. Dinner in the restaurant is not to be missed! We stayed in one of the cottages which afforded us the privacy and freedom we wanted from our honeymoon but still benefitted from the hotel's facilities and same high quality of service, cleaning and thoughtfulness of hotel staff who went the extra mile. Fully recommended!","42304":"This was the best hotel that we stayed in during our 2 weeks in Sicily. I can also say that it is one of the best that I've stayed in during any trip to Italy. We had a beautiful junior suite. The hotel is a former Benedictine monastery and also was the home to the Knights of Malta in the 16th century. It has been beautifully restored and is well cared for by the hotel staff. The hotel also has one of the best restaurants in Sicily, Don Eusebio. Our room was spacious, and the air conditioning worked extremely well in the sweltering heat. The hotel also has a nice pool in a shaded area. Breakfast was a pleasant dining experience. Service throughout is absolute perfection. The hotel is located outside of Ragusa so you have the peace and tranquility of the countryside.","42305":"Our sat nav took us up an overgrown weedy path at first but we quickly realised our mistake and drove round the corner to the proper driveway and closed gates! After a few seconds we realised we had to announce our arrival on their intercom system and then we were allowed in. We were welcomed with luggage assistance and a nice cold glass of almond milk. Then a brief tour of the gardens and pool area and shown information on the reception board about trips available. The reception and hotel room were beautifully decorated with antiques, luscious drapes and carpets befitting a converted monastery. We had a superior room with a view of a tree and red roof tiles. Adequate size and clean and bright. The iron bed was exceptionally high but comfortable enough. No water, tea or coffee in room which would have been welcome. The first night we had dinner in their wine cellar which was atmospheric. The second night tables were laid out in a candlelit courtyard which was delightful. The menu choices were a bit fancy for our liking (with prices to match) but we managed to find something we liked and the food was very tasty. Driving out into the dark countryside to find somewhere else for dinner didn't appeal to us so you are slightly a captive audience unless you want to make the effort to drive elsewhere.\nThe pool was lovely and peaceful but the sunbeds could do with a bit of an upgrade or clean. Drinks were available by waiter service by the pool which was nice. There are chickens, turkeys and pigs and a resident dog called Lilly all adding to the charm of the hotel. Overall this was a lovely stay for 2 nights.","42309":"Wow what an amazing, special place! From the moment we arrived we felt like we were visiting family in a beautiful summer home instead of staying at a hotel. You feel so peaceful and welcomed here, all while receiving five star service. The grounds are gorgeous, the staff are extremely knowledgeable and happy to answer questions, and the rooms are spacious and comfy. Do not miss dinner at Eremo - it's fantastic and a wonderful experience.\n\nWe drove to Ragusa and Modica from the hotel, then Agrigento after checking out. Special thanks to everyone for the detailed directions and sight seeing ideas! I also appreciated their honesty when they gently told me one of the towns I wanted to see was not a good place to stop, and rerouted me to a better location. Much appreciated.\n\nI would not hesitate to stay here again, I will be dreaming of Eremo when I get home!","42310":"We have spent 8 days in Eremo Della Giubiliana and we loved every moment of our stay and it was the perfect base to explore the south of Sicily and the towns of Modica, Ibla, Scicli, Noto etc..\nApart from the great and peaceful location, the hotel atmosphere and decor is very authentic and pleasant, is like stepping back in History with all nowaday comforts. A special mentioning to the staff in every department that makes you feel really at home and goes the extra mile to accomplish your needs. Also amazing food and local ingredients. If you are there on a Saturday, make sure you go to the Ricotta Cheese preparation as it is an amazing experience and also visit the Parco Molini with the excursion that the Hotels organize.","42319":"Booked and pre-paid thru major Uk travel agency. Arrived to find hotel closed.\nNo one there. No lights on. All locked up. Didn't answer phone.\nCall to Uk travel agency got staff to arrive from another hotel.\nThey had decided to CLOSE the hotel.\nWould we move to another???!!!.","42321":"As one other reviewer has mentioned, the staff in this hotel are what make it. They beam genuine smiles and are very helpful and speak great English.\nFirst thing is that parking right by the hotel is impossible and even the nearest street parking is always full. Best advice is to not even attempt to get anywhere near the hotel if you like your rental deposit in tact. Park in the car park next to the post office and it\u2019s a simple walk down hill to the hotel.\n\nThe pool is a real treat to find in the middle of a city like this and is a veritable oasis (so much so that there are mosquitos - watch out!)\nThe breakfasts were huge and covered anything you would expect from a continental breakfast.\n\nWe stayed in their basic double which was comfortable and well proportioned but just off the reception on the ground floor. The hotel need to find some way of sound insulating that room as we could hear every word spoke at reception.\n\nLocation is great - if you want to walk to the old town Ragusa it\u2019s not far as the crow flies but there are quite a few steps down and up - you will earn your lunch. Our trip down and back up reached 35 floors!\n\nAll in all a great stay made by the wonderful staff and a much needed pool!","42336":"First thing to say is that all the staff at this hotel were warm and friendly and as helpful as they could possibly be. The hotel has the potential of being very good however several things would have to be improved, attention to detail ie. dusty clothing shelves in wardrobes, ensuring previous guests detritus has been cleared from cupboards, swimming pool was filthy (could hardly see pool floor for dead bugs), run out of breakfast cereals, yoghurt and eggs several times during my stay. Street the hotel is in is very narrow and in a residential area, this makes parking horrendous although a parking permit is supplied by the hotel the parking places are limited. This makes it frustrating for both guests and residents so much so that at the end of my stay despite me displaying my permit and being parked in the correct place a local had taken out their frustration by damaging the roof quite badly on my rental car. My trip was booked through LONG TRAVEL who specialise in trips to Sicily but not in getting back to disgruntled clients after complaining several weeks ago.","42338":"The staff are very helpful and friendly. Frederick at breakfast is exceptional. Continental breakfast good with many gluten free options. Location is excellent. Beds are extremely comfortable. Generally a great hotel.","42339":"My room was so large, I could have done parties there. I even had a huge balcony OK; the building is hundreds of years old and every room is different. If you have breakfast in the huge ball-room, you feel like you have been invited to one of the families that PATRICK FEIGENBAUM has portrayed. Super location. Staff makes you feel welcome. You feel like in a private house. There is not much staff around, which in this case is no problem. Every time you need some thing, you just check with reception and they sort out absolutely everything. We stayed there with a group of people , i guess we had at least 6 or 7 rooms. Everybody love it. Some rooms were in extra building, souterrains and a bit damp, that was the only disadvantage. All together I would definitively go again.","42340":"Lovely hotel, but a nightmare for parking and for those with mobility problems as there is no lift , therefore confined to street level rooms. Lovely pool and building and handy for the town, shops and places to eat.","42341":"This was the first bed and breakfast establishment we stayed at on our 2 week holiday to Sicily. The reception staff were very helpful but apart from that it was rather disappointing. It was extremely hard to find and is situated down a steep hill which has weeds growing all over the path and road. There is no parking if you are lucky you can park about half a mile away in zone A with pass they give to display in your windscreen. If you can't park there you have to park at least a mile away again displaying your pass. The room we were in was an upgrade and quit spacious. The disappointing thing was breakfast. It was available from 7.30 a.m. till 10.00 a.m. But if you don't get there early enough everything is gone!. We arrived on our 1st day at 8.30 to find all the croissants were gone and no more were available. Surely this should be available whether you turn up at 7.30 or 10.00. We were close to town so walked out each evening for dinner. Only problem we had was on a Monday hardly anything is open, but we did manage to find a restaurant open. The steps in the B&B were very steep and no lift available to get cases up to top floor. This is supposed to have a 4 star rating but don't think this warrants this at all. We will not be going back to this B&B.","42342":"The reception staff were extremely helpful and provided assistance with local attractions and checking opening times of a winery that we wished to visit.\nFor a hotel offering Bed and Breakfast only, the breakfast was extremely poor. Scheduled to be served between 07:30 and 10:00, it was obvious that if you were not seated early then you may be lucky to have a full choice of what was available. On our first morning we were down for breakfast at about 08:30, to be told that there were no more croissants, 'they have all gone'.\nAfter the first two days of our four day stay, it was also not possible to toast any bread, as the toaster was removed.","42343":"Lovely hotel. Only caution - I would avoid rooms on the lobby\/street level as they\u2019re really cellars (we had rooms 2 & 3, room 1 is possibly also at that level). Picturesque but not truly suitable for habitation - damp seeps through, as walls & ceilings are all stone. Our bed linens and bed felt damp when we arrived and particles continually fell from the walls and ceiling. Only one window so not lots of air circulation.\n\nWe needed the AC to dry it out, but it wasn\u2019t working well - popped it open and found filters completely clogged with the same color dust as the walls. As it was Sun eve we rinsed them in shower ourselves and then it worked fine.\n\nThat said, pool\/garden is lovely, surprisingly large given the streets are so narrow. Great location if you want to walk to old city. Marco at reception was super helpful. Breakfast spread is wonderful and you can eat outside on the deck.","42346":"We stayed in Ragusa, Sicily for 8 nights at the Villa de Lauro, most people seem to stay 2-3 nights but we found it the perfect base for our holiday. Staff are really friendly, breakfast delicious with lots of choice, we used the pool area every morning and loved it. Very good location for a walk into Ragusa Ibla, just on the edge, great location for both old and new parts of town. We were there during a religious festival. Parking was easy, parked right outside every day. Loved it!","42354":"We had a wonderful, relaxing stay in July. The staff were fabulous and couldn\u2019t do enough to help.\nThe rooms, facilities and breakfast at the hotel were excellent.\nThis holiday destination is however, not for those who can\u2019t manage walking up and down steps. The views are amazing, the sicilian architecture wonderful but the terrain is steep.","42355":"A lovely hotel: fabulous pool, delicious breakfast, charming rooms. Staff very friendly, and were happy to move our room on our arrival when we complained about the smell of cigarette smoke. Helpful local advice too. A great base for exploring both Ragusa Ibla and Ragusa Superiore.","42359":"The hotel is stunning, the rooms and furnishings really classy and old. The pool and gardens are beautiful. The breakfast was plentiful and fresh......however at that point the positive comments must stop. The main problem seems to me to be the staff, its an old hotel building which is part of its charm but obviously sometimes things dont work.....its up to the staff to sort these problems out in a polite, apologetic way and during our stay this didn't happen. The first night the air conditioner didn't work, then there was no hot water, then the sky was very temperamental, the hairdryer in the bathroom basically fell apart in my hands etc etc. Finally on the last day we had to go and ask for a change or towels (they had removed the used ones but not replaced them) and the girl at the desk instead of apologising with a smile was a little bit aggressive and instantly tried to blame someone else.Little things but over a three night stay they kinda added up.......","42360":"Beautifully restored hotel with lovely garden and pool situated on a narrow street in the centre of Ragusa. All staff very welcoming and helpful. Great breakfast enjoyed on the terrace. A great place to explore the streets of Ragusa and Ragusa Ibla.","42363":"Converted palace with fine features. We found it to be ideally located to take advantage of both the old and new areas, providing you are a fit walker as the streets between the areas are steep with amazing views.\nThe staff are very helpful, providing advice on local attractions and providing the necessary local parking permit.","42366":"Following a very disappointing hotel in Syracuse this hotel was just what we needed. Very luxurious and Italian stylish with very pleasant and helpful reception staff. The room on the second floor - no lift but the receptionist carried our cases up for us - turned out to have a wonky bathroom light so we were instantly moved to a suite on the ground floor with access to the lovely gardens. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff and we felt well cared for. If you're interested in the \"old\" Ragusa then you're in the wrong town - you need to be in Ragusa Ibla - and the extremely steep way down to the floor of the valley and then up the other side to the Cathedral etc takes quite a lot of effort when you're not young and brilliantly fit! To be honest, Ragusa has little to offer the tourist and you'd need a guided tour if you want to find anything recognisable from the Montalbano series. However this hotel was perfect and we felt sad we were only there for one night.","42367":"We arrived late at the Hotel and when we entered the room (number 2) we were blown away with the amazing decor! It was the most unusual room we had ever stayed in, very spacious with a large bed, desk with a mini bar, a sofa and a dining table. There was a large glassed door leading off into the garden an pool area. It sounds strange, but there were no windows in the room, but that wasn't a major problem, the stonework made up for that.\nDue to our late arrival they had kindly left us some snacks and Prosecco in our room, there was also juice, water and Campari Sodas in the free mini bar too.\nThe main breakfast room was beautifully decorated, there was a smaller room with garden views too. There was a really good selection of breakfast items and the coffee was to die for! The only criticism I have is that the fruit (apart from the melon) was never very ripe, which was such a shame as there was always a lot to choose from. There were also cheeses, meats, cakes, toast, and lovely jams\/honey. I did hear someone ask for an all white omelette one day and that request was carried out without any fuss.\nThe reception was very good with a lovely area where you could sit and incidentally I found the best wifi reception there, although is was ok in the room, just rather slow.\nWe found that the staff, without exception were all very helpful and efficient, but special mention should be made of Valeria and Antonio on the reception desk who were a credit to the Hotel and also spoke perfect English\nWe had pre-booked the Inspector Montalbano tour, which was the main reason for our choice of destination, and were very pleasantly surprised to find that we had a luxurious Mercedes estate taxi all to ourselves at our disposal for the whole day. The driver Elena was very competent but her English was extremely limited, as is my Italian, but we managed to get along ok. We were on the tour for 6 1\/2 hours and saw some lovely sights, stopping for a snack lunch and drinks along the way.\nRagusa Ibla was lovely, but we needed a taxi ride there from the hotel as the walk is very steep, the cost was 10 euros each way. We could walk from the hotel to a square where there were some restaurants, bars and a great pizza place, this was quite an uphill walk there but easily manageable. There was also the main shopping street there, with a good selection of shops, but not that many!\nWe stayed in Ragusa for 4 nights and in hindsight, we should have perhaps moved on to Taormina or Palermo after a couple of nights, because Ragusa was quite small and not that lively in the evenings, even though it was not out of season.\nOn our last day, we had a late flight and so were at rather a loose end for the day, we enquired about getting a taxi to Modica, not that far away, just for a change of scene. The only taxi company there quoted 40 euros each way which was really disappointing as it was not a long distance and we believe not worth that expense. So we stayed in Ragusa for the day instead, but it was so quiet we couldn't even get a pizza at lunchtime to finish off our Italian holiday!\nThe Sicily people were very friendly and we will go back, but will choose somewhere with more going on.","42371":"We stayed here for 6 nights and used it as a base for exploring the area where the TV series, Montalbano, is filmed. Our room was very pleasant and roomy with a verandah and views of the lovely garden and pool. We were exhausted after the journey so used room service who brought in pizza from a local pizzeria and red wine which was quite acceptable. However, the buffet-style breakfasts were a little disappointing, for example, sometimes the meat looked a bit tired and very often the fruit was so hard you couldn't eat it. The waiting staff were generally pleasant but didn't appear to be interested in improving things. The reception staff were pleasant and generally helpful but unable to advise on the confusing timetables of the local bus service to Ragusa Ibla, the extremely picturesque part of Ragusa. It's quite a trek back to the hotel from there because of all the steep steps so this would have been very helpful.","42372":"Breakfast was ok, but the worst part of this hotel is the position. It is in a steep street and to go to the centre of Ragusa it take about 10 minutes of nearly climbing. At the end of the holiday I finished up with swollen ankles for about a week.\nNo lift, the room was like a studio apartment (which) we had not requested. It has a sofabed on the ground floor of the room which is really uncomfortable, and you have to go up a flight of extremely high steps to get to the actual comfortable bed. Imagine when you need to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night and going down those steep steps (and you are half asleep).\n\nAlso whent the Catamaran did not work due to heavy rain, they did not help us find another hotel to stay for 1 night as the hotel was fully booked.","42392":"To stay at the Villa del Lauro, you need to be fit, especially if your room is on the second floor. The steps are steep, and there is no lift. To go or return to the hotel, you will have a steep climb.\nOur room on the second floor, a junior suite,was spacious (good) but rather soulless. Our terrace overlooking the garden was something of a misnomer. A bit of a yard leading off our room, with a scant view of the garden and more of some derelict building, and nothing to sit on, if we had wanted to!\nLack of comfortable seating was another problem. This hotel does have an attractive garden, and a swimming pool, a real rarity in this town, but apart from some hard and uncomfortable loungers around the pool, there is just nowhere to sit in the garden. We did note that a couple of guests had actually gone out and bought some fold up chairs to sit on!\nIt is an attractive hotel, in a fairly good position (everywhere is on a steep slope here) and with a few concessions to comfort as well as style, would be much improved.\nOne plus: the bus stop to the old town is very near. Buses go every hour.","42398":"Stayed for two nights as part of a Shearings Grand Tourer coach holiday of Sicily and Sorrento with my wife. Bedroom was modern, clean and had a balcony that overlooked the sea front. No kettle or tea making facilities. Flat screen TV but could not find any English speaking channels. Free WiFi but could not get a very strong signal in our room. Comfortable bed and modern well equipped shower room. Before dinner the hotel laid on a welcome drink reception. Dinner was a limited option set menu and provided a special menu for my vegetarian wife, also catering for other party members with special dietary needs. Red and white wine was provided with dinner and I thought the food was very good. Staff were very friendly and accommodating and went out of their way to appease some party members who complained about the appearance of their pasta course. Hot and cold breakfast options were also very good. I think this hotel is missing a trick in that it does not have a lounge or bar sitting area where our party would have sat after dinner and spent our money on drinks! There is a nearby supermarket where you can get cheap soft drinks and alcohol.\nAll staff were friendly and made you feel welcome.\nI would come back to this hotel again.","42414":"Small rooms, my bathroom was not so clean, I could see where the mop started and stopped. The pool was large but cloudy. It did have a nice snack, drink area and it was very near the pool. You could not walk across the street to the beach, you had to walk down a bit to a small beach. I am used to large beaches in delaware but I was kinda cramped.","42415":"We just returned from a week at the lovely Hotel Andrea Doria.Whilst it was at the end of the Sicilian summer season the weather was pretty perfect. The Hotel was in a nice location just on the edge of the resort and was very comfortable and clean. The staff were friendly and helpful. Salvo just looked after us perfectly. The location is great for exploring the area and visiting the beautiful beaches and Baroque towns in the area. First class.","42416":"We had booked a Junior Suite, as that was all that was available. It was very big, and a bit of a waste of space for us. If you book through an agency make sure they sort breakfast for you as we had a split booking, which only gave us breakfast part of the time. I'm pleased to say that the manager sorted that all out for us, and we'll book direct next time. Staff were friendly and mostly helpful, even though it was the end of a very long season. Format of the restaurant had changed since our last visit two or three years ago, which didn't suit us. We hired bikes, from the hotel, for a ride out to Montabano's house in Punta Seca. Hotel has a really lovely quiet swimming pool too.","42421":"Good position, kind staff, one not secondary problem: breakfast is not included in booking, and it costs 15 \u20ac per person, couple 30 \u20ac, a bit too much...\nLuckily there is a nearby cafe where to buy a good cappuccino with brioche for 2.50 \u20ac\u2026\nThe restaurant, when open, is also quite expensive... never tried its quality as there are many good cheaper alternatives nearby.","42422":"Really enjoyed our stay here! The only negative thing about it was that it was too short! Next time we will definitely plan to stay longer. It's no coincidence that the manager's friendly and accommodating demeanor is contagious across his entire staff. From the front desk to the restaurant and housekeeping, everyone greeted us with a smile and was always available to help with any request. All rooms have a balcony with a sea-view. They are clean, quiet, comfortable and nicely furnished and include top of the line toiletries. Pool is large and well maintained with plenty of chaise lounges to relax and soak in the Sicilian sun. For all the positives of the Andrea Doria, the restaurant for us was what stood out the most about this hotel. Not at all your typical hotel restaurant! Of course, the food and service were excellent, but combined with the presentation and menu choice, this restaurant is worthy of a Michelin rating.\nAlready looking forward to our next visit!","42430":"This hotel, situation in the most charming little town on the Sicilian coast, is just perfect. Rooms are well appointed with balconies, although the bathrooms are a little small but still well appointed. Meals are great, (we had both breakfasts and dinners). There is a very nice pool area with a bar close by where you can get a pleasant lunch. The staff couldn't do enough for us. Everything was spotlessly clean, as is the lovely little town.","42434":"Me and my girlfriend had a lovely stay there.very nice staff along with a beautiful pool and a lovely room, in a relaxing environment .Also there is an adjacent bar next to the pool with very friendly staff .The reception staff were very helpful in guiding us to the coach terminal for our flight back from catania airport. The hotel rooms were also very clean","42444":"Little English spoken by staff and not very helpful relative to restaurants or things to do.\n\nBeautiful location right across the road from the promenade.\n\nRoom was small with a shower that only a midget could enjoy. No amenities, breakfast not included and restaurant offerings minima and not very good.\n\nNice pool and good views.","42449":"We stayed in the Andrea Doria for 4 nights while visiting Sicily for a friend's wedding at a cost of \u20ac169 per night for room only (optional breakfast can be added for \u20ac15 per person per night, I wouldn't bother). The hotel is near the beach, at the far end of the marina. It's about a 20 minute walk to the main part of the marina. When we visited, there was a funfair by the beach which gave the locality a slightly 'tacky' ambience. Our room was on the small side but perfectly adequate. The bathroom was clean and modern and the air conditioning mercifully powerful. The bed was comfortable and the room was clean. The laminate floor was peeling by the bathroom door which was a shame. We had a balcony looking out onto the front area of the hotel and the main road although sadly no sea view. There is an on site outdoor restaurant 'Atletico Farina' which serves nice pizzas at a good price (\u20ac8-10) all day (the bar is also open all day) and a restaurant menu at lunch and dinner. There is an outdoor pool with plenty of loungers. On the Sunday the pool was overrun with about 20 local kids and we had to move, which we found a bit frustrating. Staff were mostly friendly but not much English spoken and we had issues with communication at times. Our overall experience of Marina di Ragusa was that it is quite a basic resort. Elsewhere I would definitely have expected more for the price, but none of our group in Marina di Ragusa seemed particularly enamoured with their hotel. The group staying in Ragusa Ibla were happier and overall I would recommend staying there instead.","42474":"Ok, you're planning on going to visit Ragusa or Ibla so I won't give a review of how pretty the town is. However, I will highly recommend staying at this B&B -- one of the first and still the best.\n\nThe decor is homey yet chic, right out of the pages of Decor magazine. The rooms are huge with high ceilings, ornate chandeliers, with perfect touches of old and new.\n\nThe breakfast is a satisfying spread with homemade jams and cakes and, if the weather is good, you get to sit on the veranda overlooking the town and soaking in the whole Italian-ess of it all.\n\nLocation-wise, it is a 5-10 minute walk to the public parking lot, 5-10 min walking to the duomo and all the shops and restaurants. So, near the happening areas without being in the happening area and its noises (although when we were there it was relatively quiet all around).\n\nBut what makes this the bets damn B&B in Sicily is the wonderful proprietor and hostess Elena and her husband Simone. Elena speaks about 1000 languages and since she was born and raised in this very house, she was always happy to share with us the history of the town and make great recommendations on where to go.\n\nCiao, Elena from J and Vale. Grazie per tutti.","42483":"Has to be the most charming Band B in Ragusa Ibla. Our stay was beyond perfect. Made perfect by the caring and friendly hostess Elena and her husband Simone.\n\nThe B&B is in an ancient three story house with beautiful antiques and time worn marble stairs. Yes there are stairs (and hills) but that\u2019s Italy and Sicily!\n\nThe location is excellent for walking. No more than 3-4 minutes fo walking to the town center where you\u2019ll find all manner of restaurants, Gelato, and a beautiful park as well.\n\nThe room we had was the suite. It boasts a large comfortable round bed in a large multi level, fully restored stone with the original stone walls. The rustic original architecture made this the most unique room we have ever stayed in anywhere. Large open shower and a private entrance.\n\nIn the morning a wonderful breakfast of homemade treats both sweet and savory was offered upstairs where you can sit on the balcony, and drink Elenas fresh coffee.\n\nAbout the people here\u2026\nI won\u2019t go into details but suffice to say we had an adventure with our parked car one night\u2026..\nThe entire ordeal took a day to sort out. Elena and Simone took time out of their day to help us deal with this and went FAR beyond what even some of my friends would do for me. This is Sicilian kindness in action.. We laugh about it now.. But they were truly wonderful people when the chips were down for us\u2026! Elena if you read this\u2026 we love you both.\n\nIbla is a beautiful town that you should spend time exploring. Elena and Simone were very helpful fun guiding us with maps and addresses.\nThe views from the Town are amazing. Simone will drop you and pick you up form nearby parking if need be.\n\nWe had a Smart Car and getting right up to the B&B in that tiny thing was possible, but barely and with great care. Simone was able to navigate the 90 degree turn near the garage with ease in his 1970 Fiat. There is parking nearby (\u2026..) and they give you a pass that lets you park where other tourists cannot so that is a definite plus.\n\nOh and there is a very nice SPA in the Inn as well.. My wife enjoyed a massage while we were there..\n\nThe best B&B in Sicily\u2026 In my opinion!","42544":"A special place that's great for exploring everything in and around Ragusa. The host, Giuseppina made us feel very very welcome. Her warmth together with the great breakfast -don't forget to try the homemade lemon jam!- made us sad to leave again after 3 nights. The house, a small palace really, is amazing and transports your back to the 1800s or so. The views from both the communal terrace and the two (!) balconies in our room were amazing and twice we took the vast amounts of Sicilian orange juice and coffee that Giuseppina prepared onto our balcony to read in the sun. Doesn't get much better than this!","42551":"We stayed at this B & B one night as we had come to see the Ibla Buskers performances. It is a short walk into town, very convenient. Room was a good size for 3 people & large bathroom.All very neat & clean. Paolo helped us get a parking space which we appreciated. Breakfast was served on a beautiful roof terrace. We enjoyed this very much. Would definitely stay here again if in this area.","42561":"Our room at this B&B was very comfy, spacious and had a great balcony overlooking the street. It is perfectly situated for the old town. Paolo met us in our car and showed us where to park. He also carried our (very heavy) case down about 300 steps! He couldn't have been kinder or more welcoming. There is a fridge with litre bottles of water for 1 euro and also reasonably priced wine in the B&B. Breakfast was also lovely and served in the garden on the roof. Best of all the house is like a time machine of what an old residence in Ragusa Ibla would have been like. We would definitely stay again.","42590":"Great room. Great position. Super people. Couldn't be better. Our 3 day visit to this attractive town was made by this most convenient place with great rooms and even better people. I'm sure we'll return.","42591":"Unsophisticated authenticity and effortless hospitality. Genuine care for the guests, always in a happy mood, with smiles and practical advice, making us feel like we're staying with friends. Remarkable is the owners ability to deliver optimal service and quality for the travelers, while employing a straightforward personal approach. Normal, young, energetic people, loving their business and enjoying their way of life in beautiful Ragusa Ibla - a sheer delight.\nLocation: Perfect, just steps away for the mystical Duomo, on a quiet street, within walking distance to each corner you might be interested in discovering. Park your car as closest as the GPS takes you to the destination - we ended up in a square close to the main central alley of Ragusa Ibla - and give them a call. We were friendly greeted and told to stay put and in 10 minutes Rosita came with her car and showed us the way to the B&B. We parked our car in front of the B&B, no parking fee. While in Ragusa, just leave your car there, you won't need it.\nThe house: a beautiful, amazing old house, with tastefully decorated interior, attractive and vintage, inspired by local culture and heritage, depicting Sicilian traditions; amazing mozaics, high ceilings, a piano, splendid furniture - a set for a treasure hunt or a discovery game, just let your imagination flow :)\nThe room: very spacious room, with a curved ceiling and strong character; overlooking the front street of the B&B, and Ragusa Superiore in the back, from its small balcony. Just magical view. Perfect comfortable bed, absolute cleanness.\nThe terrace: Breakfast is served on the terrace, which is accessible all time. The space is large and lavishly green, the views over Ragusa Superiore are, again, spectacular. Great quiet spot for enjoying some wine at sunset or reading in the afternoon.\nThe breakfast: plenty and delicious, served always with smiles.\nThe people: professional as business owners, but young, energetic, full of life, full of jokes and good humor, inspirational and making you crave to do in life what you like and enjoy, with passion and unconditionally, Effortless and genuine spirits. Meet them and be filled with good vibes! Their recommendations for restaurants proved to deliver one of the most memorable experiences in our two-week holiday throughout Sicily.","42623":"This really could not be better located in the heart of historic Ragusa. It is also in a beautiful historic building so you do feel like you are getting the full experience. The hosts are lovely - even moving their motorbike to get us a better parking space.","42638":"Each apartment is perfect. Super clean, great shower, really comfortable bed, kitchen, well located. Our host was amazing - super helpful and pleasant. Now the breakfast - nothing short of amazing. This place is a 11 out of 10. I have no hesitation recommending B&B Bella Giulia to anyone.","42705":"I paid $40 for a quite nice room in the center of town\n\nafter that cam the the disappointment\n\nthe property does not serve breakfast despite claiming they area a B&B, they give you a voucher for a coffee and croissant (EUR 3 maximum value) at a cafe across town, nowhere on this voucher does it list the name or address of the cafe and of course nobody actually staffs the premises of B&B\n\nthen despite them claiming free wi-fi, that service is \"farmed out\" too from a provider that demands your email and mobile phone number after you enter some 15 digit code\n\nthen you must log in each time you use wi-fi again with a different 16 digit code and some odd password","42707":"I visited here in May 2019 the rooms were very clean and the place was centrally located . The staff and owners very friendly and can arrange a pickup for you at the bus station. The room are large and perfect for a family of 4. There is a good canolli place down the street.. I highly recommend this place..","42716":"An absolutely fantastic BnB in Ragusa. Andrea and his wife Alice are lovely young people who have created 7 of the most beautifully decorated and spacious rooms. Spotlessly clean, in a great location. The biggest rooms and bathrooms we have seen in Italy.","42718":"Thoughtfully renovated to include modern conveniences yet retain its historic ambiance, Epoca con Stile was one of our favorite B&Bs on our Sicily visit. The owners are welcoming and do their best to make sure guests are comfortable. They provide a breakfast of Sicilian specialties and excellent cappuccino (or coffee to made to order) in a pleasant dining room or on the terrace when the weather is fine. This B&B has a soothing atmosphere of peace and tranquility with spacious rooms, high ceilings and tile floors. The beds\/bedding, shower, towels, and AC are all very good and the housekeeping is of a high standard. Parking is free in the public lot near the Giardino Ibleo, a short five minute walk from the B&B.","42719":"Constanza met us at the door, helped us find a good parking space and welcomed us in. Showed us the beautiful B&B and told us some of the history. Our room was delightful and I cannot say enough about our hosts.","42721":"One cannot ask for more then 300 years old palazzo with 21st century accommodations, great location, terrific breakfast and wonderful hosts.\n\nIn fact, the host helped out with booking local restaurants, explaining where to go and suggestioning local attractions and activities!","42723":"I stayed in one of the double rooms about three years ago and recently returned to stay in the suite. I can't emphasize what a fabulous job the proprietors do to make sure their guests have a comfortable and pleasant stay. They were always prompt to reply via email--even to the occasional question we had while we were staying there. Although there is no parking on the premises we never had a problem finding a spot on the street nearby. The room was immaculate with antique Liberty furniture. It was very nice to return to the palazzo in the evening after strolling the quiet streets of Ragusa. The air conditioning worked great and the beds were comfortable. The bathrooms were large, modern and very comfortable. There is always an ample spread at breakfast with Ragusan specialties including meats, cheeses and baked goods. This is a terrific place to stay in historic Ragusa Ibla but also a fantastic choice to see the region.","42725":"We loved staying here so much. Maria and Constanza are wonderful hosts and really went out of their way to make our stay comfortable. The BnB is in a perfect position for getting around and very quiet, ensuring an excellent sleep on very comfortable beds. The breakfast is delicious. This is also probably one of the cleanest places I have ever stayed in. Do not hesitate to stay here. We would love to be back one day.","42726":"I stayed two nights in this lovely little B & B in an old Palazzo in the middle of Ragusa Ibla. There are only four rooms. My room (Nr. 3) was very big, furnished with antique furnitures and a comfy bed. The two sisters Maria and Constanza running the place are very warm hearted and gave all advice needed. The breakfast is serviced in a small room or when the weather is good on a lovely sun terrace. The breakfast and coffee served were delicious. Parking is possible without payment in the small streets around the B & B. Don't miss to eat in Trattoria La Bettola, also run by two sisters. So tasty and not expensive at all.","42736":"A lovely place to stay and very central. Only had one night here - very large rooms and well equipped bathrooms.\nThe bed was comfortable. Constanza was very hospitable and helpful. It was peaceful and quiet.","42740":"The Epoca Camere Con Stile really lives up to its name. Bags of style and our ground floor room was very\nstunning with plenty of room and a beautiful curved ceiling.\nThe room also had a free of charge safe included so that was nice.\n\nCostanza was extremely helpful and charming and suggested several things for us to do and see.\n\nThe breakfast was typical Italian fare but with much of it local to Ragusa and served on the terrace.\n\nEverything right, nothing wrong. Highly recommend.","42762":"Beautiful countryside views, very clean, very good food , beautiful rooms, staff friendly and helpful ,perfect place to relax, away from the stressful life , highly recommended, if you are looking for a place to relax","42763":"We found this superb B&B by coincidence.\nIt's everything you wish for and than they go beyond.\nGreat location, spectacular view, quiet, 5 star hospitality, incredible breakfast.\nWhat makes this special is the way you feel welcome and at home.\nYou feel as guest that Giorgio puts his heart and soul in this project.\nAs does his very friendly team.\nWe stayed one evening for home made dinner. It was very special.\nWe hesitated on writing a review because, honestly, we want to keep this gem all to ourselves.\nBut the experience was so great that it would be unfair not to promote this brand new B&B or highly recommend it.","42784":"Borgo Monachella is the place to stay if you have your own transport. Signora Antonietta and Signor Piero were there to welcome us so late in the night. The place is very inviting with clean and comfortable rooms in a tranquil and serene surroundings. Breakfast comes with a variety of delicacies every day, home-made by Signora Antonietta herself. No other place beats Borgo Monachella in hospitality, cleanliness and delicious breakfast!","42785":"A warm welcome by Antonietta and her husband on our arrival. A dream of a place to stay , a place run by a wonderful loving family. Our room was so clean and found it in perfect order on our return from daily sightseeing. Loved the homemade sweets and tarts prepared by Antonietta. Her marmalades were delicious - so glad I was able to take some home! A visit to this place is a mujst.","42852":"Situated off the main road as many have mentioned but this adds to it's charm, in my opinion.\n*\nIt is a bit difficult to find if you cannot access Wifi for GPS.. (Travel secret - Google Maps will work offline). In any case, to address some of those concerns, print directions ahead of time if you plan on booking. Even though the roads are narrow and not lit, it is one road, pretty direct after turning off main road with the Steakhouse being your landmark.\nThe owners, Ivana and Elio are quite warm and welcoming. I saw them interacting with other guests, offering help to map out their day. They do have limited English but understand somewhat.\n*\nThe property is laid out Farm Style with the main house, being the office\/welcome area and the breakfast area. I do believe there are 2 rooms available in the main house also. Up the road, 2 mins walk along a path, you can find the other rooms. Rooms are spacious, updated and clean. Each room has their own outdoor seated area.\nThere are numerous loungers and chairs located on the property. All seemed to be strategically placed in shaded area, a much welcome sight on a scolding day. Especially if you enjoy reading a book outdoors or painting. This is what I imagined myself doing LOL.\nSaving the best part for last - Wouldn't be a Bed and Breakfast, without talking about the breakfast.. Two Words - Mangia Tutti!!! Ivana serves up a beautiful display of homemade baked cakes and pastries, homemade marmalade, freshly made cappuccino and espresso.\n*\nIt took us 15mins (by car) to get to the Marina di Ragusa which is not bad.\nCannot wait to visit again.","42860":"It's in the middle of nowhere but, actually, most accommodation is like that in the area and it adds to the charm of the place. I think it will better appreciated in cooler weather as there are no big trees around. It's a quiet countryside stone setting. Very clean and peaceful. A great variety of cakes at breakfast time. The hosts are kind and helpful. The beach, Modica, Ragusa, Scicli, everything takes about half an hour although the distance is different, it's a matter of type of road.\nBeware at night when you drive around. There are few cars on the countryside roads but there are very narrow and there are some uneven parts.","42918":"A very nice hotel in a charming old building, perfectly located for walking around the old town. No restaurant at the hotel, but lots of restaurants, coffee shops, gelato bars, etc. within a 3 to 5 minute walk. Excellent breakfast in the morning. A relatively quiet location. Clean and proper.\n\nVery pleasant and hospitable staff, everyone speaks English.\n\nParking might be a challenge - the hotel does not have a parking lot, which means you will need to park on the street.","42919":"Warm welcome by exceptionally friendly and helpful staff. Large and beautifully decorated room with equally large bathroom. Heavenly bed. Fast and reliable WiFi. Plentiful breakfast. If you are a cookie monster, then this is the place to be (see photo). Excellent price \/ quality ratio. Of all the baroque cities in this region, Ragusa is by far the most laid back, with a wide variety of historical buildings, bars and excellent restaurants.","42928":"Super quiet location in the beautiful town\nClean but tired property ,don\u2019t get excited about the chromotherapy shower\nStaff needed training in \u2018can do\u2019 mentality, examples being no wine in hotel,no room service .\nIf it called itself B and B we wouldn\u2019t have been disappointed so bear that in mind .","42932":"Recent reviews say all that needs to be said. The location was perfect, the service was unobtrusive but excellent when needed, the breakfast offered an amazing choice, and we couldn't fault the room. Thoroughly recommended.","42933":"We stayed 3 nights in this small hotel in the middle of Ibla Ragusa. While it may not have as many amenities as hotels in upper Ragusa, this is much better to be in this historic area, within walking distance of all the sights of Ragusa Ilba. The breakfast was plentiful, varied and delicious. The only downside was the small shower but this was outweighed by the other pluses.","42934":"Hotel Il Barocca has lovely rooms and a breakfast that has so much choice it is difficult to decide on what to eat - lots of meats, cheeses, breads, pastries, small cakes and also scrambled eggs, bacon etc. Well done! The rooms vary but are generally very comfortable with good furnishing and medium sized bathrooms. There is a common area in the front for sitting under the umbrellas and relaxing. It is just around the corner from the main Piazza in Ragusa Ibla so very handy for evening strolls and restaurants. There are really no views from the hotel but that doesn't matter because it is part of the old town and very handy to everything it has to offer.","42937":"Many of my comments will reflect the many positive which appear in other reviews. A very comfortable hotel with interesting decor and structure - all the rooms are unique. Despite its age there is no sign of mustiness and it is very clean. The breakfasts are amazing with a wide selection of fresh fruit, cold meats and Sicilian pastries. There are many eateries within easy walking distance for lunches and evening meals.\n\nThe staff are very friendly and they make you feel at home. Highly recommended","42938":"Our Overseas Adventure Travel tour group was to have stayed in another hotel, in the centuries-old \u201cNew\u201d Ragusa. A last minute change placed in the heart of centuries-older Old Town Ragusa. Divine intervention?\u263a Il Barocco is a godsend. About three blocks from the Cathedral, this boutique-like hotel has 15-foot ceilings, spacious rooms, and modern bathroom features. The breakfast buffet is incredible: fresh fruit, yogurt, cappuccino, juice, cheese\u2026and what most Americans seem to crave\u2014carb overload.\n\nWhat pleased me most is the friendly, hospitable staff. Everyone was kind. Passing someone in a hallway, I was asked if everything was to my liking, though she didn\u2019t know in which room I stayed (105). Returning from a city stroll, the receptionist recognized me and had the key ready, asked if I enjoyed my walk. I\u2019ve rarely experienced such kindness in any hotel. Although Il Barocco is TripAdvisor reviewer rated #17 of 37 Ragusa hotels, my opinion is that it\u2019s #1\u263a","42939":"Our very large room had a king-sized bed and a sofa bed. We pulled apart the king to create two separate beds and still had lots of floor space. One window opened to a small balcony facing the mountains, another over the hotel's terrace below, plus a window in the bathroom. As in all the hotels we stayed at in Sicily, the walls were thick and the tile or marble floors cold (it was November). We found this part of town to be shut down in the evening but we had a very nice dinner at Il Giardino (pizza, broccoli with lemon, mixed salad, bread, and a gift from the chef of bruschetta). The breakfast was a buffet: many cakes and cookies, fruits, cheeses, meats, juices, and a choice of coffees. A very welcome feature of Il Barocco is that you can park for free on the street in front of the hotel.","42941":"A striking and beautifully maintained hotel in traditional Sicilian style in the very heart of this historic town. The staff and owner could not have been more welcoming and helpful.\n\nCourtyard was a haven of charm and calm.","42965":"We had three nights here snd highly recommend it. Staff friendly, hotel quiet, bed comfortable, breakfast amazing variety. And all right in the centre of beautiful Ragusa. We were there for a festa and the atmosphere in town was great.","42994":"You may all know that if owner or responsable alwayes in side, this is well running business\nThis hotel is a best example of this\nNice decoratione, very lovely staff , clean\nWhatelse you need ? Answer is simple nothinging\nNice trip","43004":"Hotel locates in an old building at main pedestrian street in new town. Our suite was not en suite but a big room. Bathroom was quite tiny. Rooms have names, not numbers, and they are not easy to find first time.\nService was not the best. We arrived early due to ferry from Valletta. There was no check-in before 1 pm even while there were only few guests in the hotel.","43008":"This hotel was dimly lit and somewhat run down. Ragusa is actually on two hilltops and all the sights are on the other hilltop, which requires going down and up winding roads. This hotel showed its age with dimly lit rooms and hallways. The only thing new was the elevator. Parking was available for 15 Euros daily. Breakfast was ample but the quality was disappointing and not very fresh. The hotel staff was polite.","43009":"Interesting boutique hotel old Abbey. Located upper Ragusa so need to walk down, down, down to lower Ragusa where al the action is. But the walk down is spectacular especially evenings before sunset. Take a taxi back. Rooms comfortable but not luxurious. Light challenged which is common for \"boutique hotels\". Friendly but skeletal staff. Quiet, Breakfast, meh.","43018":"The hotel is located in the center, easy to reach and easy to use as base to explore the area. Our room was big, clean and comfortable; the building is very hold and they did a good job in converting it in a hotel. The breakfast was very nice, but maybe they could have offered some more local products (focacce, scaccie...). We found a bit ridiculous that an omelette was considered an extra for breakfast and that the visit to the wellness centre is not included in the price of the room. I find the price quite high and I would not expect to pay these extra. This is the only negative point, the staff is very helpful and professional. Not sure we will go again.","43019":"This is an hotel which is quite difficult to find, unless you know exactly where it is located.There is no obvious sign outside, and no facade. The only clue on Corso Italia, are three flags flying on the first floor. Under these, is a VERY narrow archway, which leads to the hotel and the reception.\nOur first complaint, was that immediately upon arrival, the staff were taking our luggage from the car,and insisted on doing so. If I had have requested this, there would be no problem. Secondly, I was informed that the car would be parked by another member of staff, 20-30 metres away. For this privilege, there was a charge of 15 euros per night. It may be possible to park on the street outside, but one, you would have to find a parking spot, and two, I do not know how safe that would be.\nCheck-in was fine. The room on the first floor was quite small, with a vaulted ceiling.Although there was a window, which looked out onto the narrow courtyard, where we had left the car, it was quite gloomy.\nVery clean, but not much storage space.\nI was quite amazed to see a reviewer remark on how good the breakfast buffet was. We thought at best,it was mediocre. We had booked through Expedia,and had a ' Full Breakfast ' included, but fried,scrambled and poached eggs were all 5 euros extra.The fruit was limited and overall, did not think this was anything like a five star standard.\nAs we were able to get a special rate through Expedia, we were not charged a 5 * price.","43025":"We stayed for 6 nights, using this hotel as our base to explore south-east Sicily. It was a fantastic place to return to each night and the accommodations and service were simply top notch. We had a suite whose dimensions allowed us to treat it as home for a week. While the furnishings and decor may not be to everyone's taste, the pictures that accompany this page do not lie. This is what the place looks and feels like. It is intended to offer a real feel of a renovated Palazzo and does that superbly.\n\nWe were traveling by car and our vehicle was handed over to staff each evening and parked for us overnight in a courtyard behind the hotel. A modest parking charge was made but the security of private parking was well worth the cost. Just be sure that, if you are driving, your car is not too wide. The entrance to the hotel from Corso Italia is quite narrow and has an unfortunate uneven \"lip\" into the covered area. That requires some delicate steering to keep your wing mirrors intact.\n\nThe staff of the hotel were unfailingly friendly and attentive, greeting us as we moved about in the hotel. All but one (the man tasked with parking and returning the car) had very good English. But he was also affable and friendly.\n\nOur suite was cleaned daily so that it was spotless and it was set up often more than once a day, for example if we had returned and then gone out again. The bathroom is well equipped, though the shower is not fixed and has to be set up using a \"pull out\" arrangement. We found at first that it seemed the hose feeding the shower did not have enough length to allow it to be fully deployed, but it just needed a little more force to release the full length of the hose and allow the shower head to be mounted in the bath area. A small uncertainty - the bathroom sink seemed not to have a plug to allow water to be caught for shaving etc. After 6 nights we still could not work this out and so the sink was used by leaving the water running.\n\nBreakfast was part of our package and was a great way to start each day. The standing breakfast consisted of cereals, pastries, conserves, fruit, and a selection of cold meats and cheese. Boiled eggs and bacon were also provided. In addition it was possible to order other dishes such as scrambled eggs and bacon, well made and tastefully served. Coffee and other orders were taken by breakfast staff who looked after us wonderfully.\n\nThe hotel has a restaurant (Truffle Bistrot) which is situated in the same building and caters to guests, events in the hotel, and the public. It is a fine dining experience (separately reviewed) and the hotel offers guests a generous discount on the prices normally applicable in this establishment.\n\nLaundry service is available but was the only instance in which we thought the hotel could improve its service. The expected norm is for same-day return of laundry when it is deposited in the morning. Laundry collection in this case was in the evening and return could not be guaranteed for the next day and certainly not if it was submitted on a holiday. That said, we had our laundry back within 24 hours. The arrangements simply left you uncertain as to when the laundry might be seen again!\n\nOur 6 night stay at the hotel cost about 1600 Euros, including taxes, laundry service and parking but excluding the cost of restaurant dining. We considered this to be a good price for the level of service and attention to detail exhibited by the hotel and its staff. We would not hesitate to recommend the hotel as a base in Ragusa, Sicily.","43026":"Top notch customer service. Fabulous hotel. The breakfast buffet was to die for. They provided excellent taxi service support. Their taxi from the Catania airport complemented the rental bikes that were dropped taken there for us. My husband and I enjoyed cycling the area each day. We didn't need or want a car at all. Four nights here and four nights in Ragusa resulted in a better bike tour of Sicily than many of the packaged cycling tours. Tony the Taxi Guy transported our luggage from Noto to Ragusa for us. The bikes were picked up from Ragusa and we took a taxi back to the airport. A fab bike tour of Sicily made better by staying in elegant historic places.","43028":"As others have said this hotel is in a great location in a lovely old mansion with decor to match, which in our opinion was a little too much; heavry drapes and lots of taffeta everywhere. Some may enjoy the decor, but it seemed dark and old to us. The first room we received did not have a shower so we were given another room with one but had to move to another one after two days. I guess we should have requested a shower with our reservation but failed to do so. The televisions in both rooms barely worked and we had to have staff come repeatedly to get them operating. Very nice staff and very helpful with our issues, but it was an awkward stay for us. Great restaurant attached to the hotel with wonderful food and lovely service.","43031":"our stay was really pleasant and it was very special to walk through an old palace, where many things were still as it was. The other areas could have been a bit more modern in our eyes. For example the hall ways, there were many accessories that made it a bit odd. Also the smell in the hotel was an old smell, with some parfume, this was really not needed. the housekeeping was great and many times in between on a day the room was checked. Breakfast great, service great. You should really do something nice with the roof terrace, this could be a great place to hang out with a drink. I missed that in the hotel. There was no bar or lounge area.","43039":"Great location. Friendly, helpful staff. Great breakfast. Convenient valet parking. Clean comfortable room. And so on and so on - up to two hundred characters. And then some more and much more. Because who knows","43041":"The hotel is fantastic, a beautiful building directly opposite the Cathedral. The room was nice,and the breakfast was lst class, the best we had on our 2 week trip. The walk into lbla is simply stunning, with an excellent selection of places to eat. We spent one day on the beach at the Ragusa marina which again is a lst class resort. A beautiful area of Sicily which we will always remember. Top draw in all ways.","43043":"An ideal location for visitors to Ragusa and Ibla, Antica Badia is a friendly, well-run hotel in an historic building. The interior is sumptuous and very 'period', and the staff and management could not have been more helpful and welcoming. Highly recommended!","43046":"Good breakfast, affordable wine, good recommendations and support from the staff. The rooms are special and fun. The super puffy drapery is an added bonus. Ignacio was so helpful with recommendations.","43047":"If you\u2019re tired of the same old hotel rooms, would like a change with some history thrown in, then stay at this boutique hotel. Just twelve rooms situated in the baroque splendour of this historic mansion, once occupied by the founder of Ragusa. Professional and helpful staff complete the experience. Well worth the stay!","43048":"We were very disappointed with our stay here. Located in a historic building, the price was far more than we should have paid for a place with no bottled water, terrible internet, no bar. Some of the staff seemed a bit snooty, perhaps because the hotel was so \"historic\". We would never return.","43050":"Good location, very helpful staff, room was fantastic, lovely breakfast, calm atmosphere. Would definitely go again. Reception staff were helpful in recommending restaurants, sorting our taxis, etc. Lovely cafes quite close to the hotel, great to pass the time and people watch.","43053":"Was a beautiful retreat tucked into an alley. We were greeted by a very friendly concierge at the desk who was very helpful both in day trips and restaurant suggestions. We were very happy during our stay there","43057":"Gorgeous gorgeous hotel and spa. My daughter, sister and I had a wonderful time here. The rooms were comfortable and well appointed. The staff was helpful and friendly. Location was convenient to shopping and restaurants.\n\nAttached photo is all of us on rooftop of the hotel.","43059":"Amazing facilities, excellent services. Mr. Michele Criscione gave us great help and did the best possible to fulfill all our needs. The hotel is good located and may be the base to travel all the south-eastern part of Sicily.","43060":"We chose this truly unique gem that exuded Old World charm w New World amenities. The room was very spacious w barrel arch vaulted ceilings and was functional and accommodating but a bit spartan w\/ the lighting. The bed was a tad bit rigid. Bathroom was sleek, sumptuous and fully appointed. Staff was excellent, very good service at front desk and breakfast. The breakfast spread was excellent with a la carte items available - cappuccino was top notch. Would recommend. We came to Ragusa in the month of February - the weather was somewhat uncooperative with intermittent rain but the climate was very agreeable and the vibe in Ragusa was calm in February.","43063":"This hotel was the home of Ragusa's founder and was the first building completed after the earthquake. It wasn't just a home, it was a palace -- with many cozy nooks and crannies, unusual staircases and a large ballroom. The decor makes you feel like you are living in a palace. We rented two rooms - one for my husband and I, another for our two adult sons. Both were roomy and comfortable. Breakfast was plentiful and delicious. The staff was very accommodating and we had a great stay. Parking was a bonus.","43072":"Unfortunately this hotel is past its prime. The common areas were fine, but the bedroom was not good. Shower water pressure and temp constantly changed - poor\/good pressure & hot\/cold temps. Snotty baseboards, tacky furniture, poor bed. Definitely not 5 stars.","43074":"We chose Ragusa rather than Ragusa Ibla (the older town) because of its easier access with a larger car that we had during our trip around Sicily. Our hotel, an old Palazzo that once belonged to a Barone, is almost opposite the town\u2019s cathedral of San Giovanni Battista and was very easy to find and even easier to park as one could drive straight into the driveway where an employee took charge of the car and our baggage in a most efficient way. Check in processing was quick and courteous and although we were early for our rooms they took our suitcases and suggested the next door bar and restaurant that belong to the hotel where we could wait for our rooms.\n\nOur room was large, with period furnishings, a balcony that looked out at the interior driveway of the hotel and had a good size bathroom. On the same floor was the breakfast room, two adjoining rooms with a third one where the breakfast on offer was laid out, our coffee order was taken and we served ourselves at the buffet. Food was plentiful although the variety was less than at other places, given the smaller size of the hotel.\n\nThis is a great period building with all the modern facilities that one might require at a central location that provides easy access to restaurants and within easy walk to the attractions of Ragusa Ibla.","43075":"This hotel suited our needs perfectly. It is only a 25 minute walk to Ragusa Ibla via a most charming network of stairs and quiet streets. We were also lucky to find out that it is within a 2 minute walk to the hip restaurant strip in Ragusa just past the piazza across from the hotel. It is a great hotel for the money.","43084":"The hotel itself is beautiful and the staff are to a person warm and helpful. The room though was dark- the shower leaked onto the floor. An electric tea kettle and coffee maker would have been nice to have in room.","43086":"We stayed for a weekend at the Villa Boscarino and everything was great.\nVery clean,we stayed in an elegant room with a balcony with view on their lovely and well-kept garden. The staff was professional and polite and when I informed about my diet restrictions, they exceeded the expectations accommodating for me a gluten-free breakfast!\nHighly recommended.","43096":"Stylish, high class and unique hotel in an old palazzo with a beautiful flowering garden and small pool. If you have a car and would like to get the vibe of the real Ragusa, it\u2019s a perfect spot to discover the area.\n\nThe hotel is based really far from Ibla and the main sightseeing spots in an faceless residential area. It\u2018s kind of a clash but typical for Scicily.","43097":"Spent 2 nights in Villa Boscarino.\n\n- Impressed with the villa, beautifully renovated, the room we stayed in was apparently newly renovated on the ground floor.\n- warmly welcomed by the friendly staff, be it front desk or service staff, the local\/recommended restaurants were well explained at our arrival.\n- the jacuzzi at the exterior was a pleasant added touch , with lounge chairs at your request\n- room with high ceiling, modern, tastefully renovated\n- location was only a few km away from Ragusa Ibla and absolutely convenient with a car. Located in a calm neighbourhood, a big supermarket LIDL was not that far away by car\n- breakfast was a bit simple but definitely sufficient.\n\nDefinitely recommend staying at Villa Boscarino if you are planning to sleep in Ragusa","43098":"Hidden in a rather austere district of Ragusa Alta, this boutique hotel is the epitome of good taste. The building dates back from 1895 and has been totally refurbished in a very tasty way preserving architectural elements while offering a series of very structured and geometrical parti pris which participate in the general balance.\nPersonnel are discreet but extremely friendly, with a warm and elegant touch and an obvious passion for what they achieved.\nRooms are perfect. Tasty. Refined.\nThe garden is fresh and the jacuzzi welcoming.\nThe place is quiet but in a very nice way and the team gave us the best advice as to what to see, where to drink, where to eat in Ragusa.\nDo not think twice when visiting Ragusa.","43101":"The main hotel structure is indeed a tasteful renovation of a historic building with rooms in a modern style within that area. Yes, there are private patios and in back a terraced garden. Beyond that - we had frustrations. We were travelling with another couple, also well-travelled. All of us found the rooms small with bathing facilities awkward and tight for space. We understand that the owner intends to add further rooms on the upstairs - we urge that they add another 15% in space to make the rooms more comfortable and reconsider the configuration of the shower\/bathtub combination. The location is off the main part of the new town - the hotel says a 5 minute drive. It is that if not more. The old historic center even further. There are no restaurants, even shops in the area of the hotel so you must either take a taxi or drive - or walk a long way. We\u2019re walkers but even we hesitated. The hotel might provide a courtesy shuttle. Also disappointed that the welcome drink was not offer.","43114":"What a lovely and comfortable stay! Service is excellent and welcoming, breakfast is delicious (too many sweets though) and a lovely garden to spend your morning in. The hotel is inside an older beautiful house but with very modern rooms and very fresh, lovely bathrooms. Located a bit on the outskirts of the city, there are excellent communications to old town and back. You will not be making that trip on foot on the way back ayway. Recommended!","43181":"This B&B is quite difficult to find without GPS because of the one-way system. It must have taken 40 minutes and a lot of driving around, seeing the road and not being able to get to it! There is free parking close by.\nThe two rooms we booked were on the top and next to the top floor with only stairs, so elderly or unfit people would struggle.\nThe rooms were large and airy, with bathrooms and a kitchenette. They were clean and a very good breakfast in the Sicilian style (sweet pastries and cakes) was served in the rooms.\nThe owner was more than helpful in recommending local restaurants.","43209":"Every traveler should be able to experience the beauty and serenity that comes with a stay at the Hotel Antico Convento. Set in a restored ancient monastery, the comfortable rooms have everything that you want or need and are designed with minimal simplicity that enhances the experience. The staff are excellent, the view divine, and the breakfasts are scrumptious. I feel so fortunate to have had the chance to stay here and would recommend it to anyone traveling to Ragusa.","43214":"What a beautiful locations, room and hotel. The staff was amazing...Very helpful and attentive. The views were breath taking, location was great for walking to the old part of town. The rooms were second to none.","43216":"This review is long overdue. We got married in Ragusa Ibla in August 2018 and chose the convento as the venue for our wedding reception, plus accommodation for ourselves and some of our guests. The hotel is set in the most beautiful gardens - quiet and peaceful yet only 5 mins walk in to Ibla centre. The convent itself has been restored to impeccable standards - it is spotlessly clean and modern inside but retains so many original features, it is a wonderfully serene place. The rooms are small (having previously been monk cells) but are simply a place to sleep, they are comfortable and have everything you need. We stayed twice before our wedding and both times were pleased with the hotel, rooms, location and staff.\nNow to the wedding. What can we say!! Everything was perfect from start to finish - better than we could have imagined. The staff at the hotel helped deliver our dream wedding - from Barbara the events manager who worked very hard to ensure everything was as we had discussed and went to plan, the incredibly friendly and welcoming receptionists and waiters who were so helpful when accommodating ours and our guests needs and always did so with a smile, to the chefs who delivered an exceptional menu of traditional Sicilian menu with a twist (including our incredible cannoli tower \u2018wedding cake\u2019 we requested! See photos). The whole team of staff treated us like royalty over the 5 days we were there. Our guests are still talking about it now! Antico Convento will always be special to us but it really is a gem not to be missed if in Ragusa Ibla. And for us, the perfect venue for a wedding reception.","43218":"We stayed 1 night during a Back-Roads tour. The hotel was chosen by BR. Beautiful repurposed boutique property. We had a small room & bathroom. Service was very good, breakfast average, in an indoor room. It\u2019s a shame they couldn\u2019t use the beautiful gardens.","43225":"On an evening walk in Ragusa\/Ibla we discovered the Hotel Antico Convento. It had a lovely restaurant patio and exquisitely decorated dining areas inside. We didn't get to stay in the hotel itself, but if we ever return to this part of Sicily, it would be my choice. Because it is a converted monastery, I believe the rooms would be very small..... but the atmosphere of the place is incredible.","43226":"I came here several times and every time it has been special. My favorite hotel and spot in the world for a truly Italian experience with the confort and good taste.\nOnly the place is a delicatessen. Being in an ex convent where you can feel the peace and quiet anytime of the day.\nIn the middle of a Park like the \u201cGiardini Eblei\u201d with super old churches and fountains...!\nIn a small town like Ragusa Ibla :heart_eyes_cat: surrounded by nature, green landscapes and fresh water...\ngoogle Ragusa Ibla, Giardini Eblei, Antico convento and your next trip will have to be there.\nThe vegan food is exquisite!\nYou can pick the fruits from the trees and smell fresh aromatic herbs all around :pray:????:heart:.","43228":"This is a converted convent and the rooms are tiny and basic. It is very well located with fantastic views, lovely staff and clean. We had to open one case in the bathroom as there is no room for two cases in the bedroom.","43229":"Let me add to the chorus of positive vibes sent to the Hotel Antico Convento dei Cappuccini. We stumbled upon it after driving the whole day, and it was one of those serendipitous disoceries that make travel so fun, a of highlights of our trip. It's a novelty, to stay in a former monastery, for sure. So not for everyone, I suppose. But the mood suited Ragusa Ilba perfectly: serene, spiritual, show-stoppingly beautiful, a historic and ultra useful location at the end of the public promenade. Any small conventional inconvenience (Did some misguided review actually criticize them for not having a bathrobe?) is easily overshadowed by the memorable, scenic, convenient and warm atmosphere at Hotel Cappuccini. This is a place that makes you gush when you tell your travel stories to the kids back home. And the breakfast, in its own cultivated, refined way, was the best we had of any Italian or Sicilian hotel we stayed. We loved this place.","43231":"Rooms and bathrooms are a bit small but an excellent deal for the price. Staff was very helpful. I would recommend staying here when you are in Ragusa. Lunch was good, breakfast was worth it. The room was very quite.","43233":"Such a lovely place to stay in Ragusa Ibla ... The old convent is surrounded by a garden and our room had an amazing view over the valley greenery. Location is also perfect ... very central. I will definitely stay here if I visit Ragusa Ibla again ... recommended!!","43297":"Overall this Hotel served its purpose well.\nOn the positive side it\u2019s close to the centre (new Town) and the Hotel is genuinely interesting.\nOur Room was on the first floor overlooking the Street and had a huge ceiling and had lots of character.\nThe bed was comfortable and free water was in the mini-Bar.\nThe lightning wasn\u2019t great and the safe in the room was operated with a key on the same key ring as the card which operated the lights.\nNice idea except that to lock, or unlock, the safe you had to take the card out of the light reader and within 60 seconds you were in darkness!\nIt also had Sky so we could watch the Ryder Cup and see Europe win which was a real bonus!\nThe are some useful observations to make.\nThere are no lifts and getting to the first floor if you have heavy bags, as we did, is difficult after a long drive although when we checked out the guy on Reception gave me a hand.\nIf you have a room on the second Floor bear this in mind, especially if you have a lot of luggage!\nI think we were unlucky as the night we stayed was a day of celebration (can\u2019t remember what it was) and there was a Disco going on until at least midnight, if not later.\nThis was followed by people having a long and protracted argument in the Street at 3.30am.\nNot the fault of the Hotel (clearly) but it\u2019s a risk with close proximity to city centres plus having a room street facing.\nThe Breakfast was slightly disappointing compared to other places we stayed.\nIt was OK but very basic.\nParking is also a lottery for those who drive there.\nOn Sunday street parking is Free.\nWe were very lucky but on another day I\u2019m not sure how we would have managed, although I\u2019m sure we would have found a solution but this is definitely worth bearing in mind.\nThe WiFi was good.\nGetting to Ibla (old Town) is walkable downhill although a mammoth trek getting back unless super fit especially if you are having a meal there as well.\nThe going rate for a Cab is \u20ac10 which is a bit pricey but unless you drive (not really recommended as parking is very limited) it\u2019s the only real option.\nStupidly we did wait for the Bus (at the right time) but unsurprisingly it didn\u2019t turn up!","43306":"Small friendly hotel in the centre of the C18 new town, near to the cathedral, and within walking distance of Ragusa Ibla (many steps, but picturesque). Large rooms, no lift. Good breakfast. For meals there is the excellent Giro de Vite osteria opposite. No private parking; if no room on the local roads, there is space in the nearby covered car park.","43318":"My husband and I stayed here for his birthday trip.\n\nThe room we stayed in was simple, beautiful! There was water in the fridge each morning and rooms where serviced each day.\n\nA continental breakfast was available each morning consisting of meat, cheese, breads, cereal and fruit.\n\nThis hotel is very close to San De Giovanni Square with the shopping district within 5 minutes walk.","43345":"Very nice hotel, very pleasant and helpful staff, huge room, extensive breakfast served in large downstairs room. Close to good reasonably priced restaurant. Close to bus stop for local bus travelling between Ibla (if you decide that the stairs are too much for you) and inter town bus station In our opinion better to stay in Superiore rather than Ibla","43378":"I booked directly on hotel sight so I could get early and late check I'm plus welcome drink. I asked for a glass of red wine and a cheese plate on the rooftop terrace which I really enjoyed. The view is very nice. I loved the location of this property. Right beside the 'blue dome' you see in pictures. The main square is about a ten minute walk where there are several restaurants and sights.\nThe room I had was vert large, very clean, cute balcony, very small shower ne no safe. There is a mini bar with pay items in it.\nI had breakfast included but I had to leave before to catch a train so I didn't even get a coffee unfortunately. the hotel ordered a taxi the night before (10euro to and from train or bus) which was waiting for me .\nThe only advice I could mention is ( and by no means am I saying this was their fault) they knew I was catching a train, and there was a strike that day so I ended up waiting for a train that never arrived. I would if at least es stayed and had breakfast and rebooked on the bus as I left early. There are very few rooms therefore that is why I suggest this.\nOverall very nice property and great staff.","43381":"Ragusa is a delight to visit. Winding, narrow streets in old town full of mystery behind each corner. Beautiful and very friendly people speaking a rhythmically beautiful language. Wonderful restaurants, shopping, and accomodations. spectacular hotel\nwith a magnificent breakfast (I still miss it).","43385":"The website is deceiving and I don't know how it is rated 9.4 by TripAdvisor, we booked the junior suite which is very basic with a tiny bathroom no safe for your valuables and a tiny bathroom that is so outdated. The bottom level has old chairs and is not appealing at all. The floor and handrails are sticky and have not been cleaned well. How disappointing as we booked because of the rating and this hotel should not have this rating at all. Very hard to find as well if you are driving","43398":"This is a modern, well equipped hotel (no lift) with amazingly kind, helpful staff. It's close to the old city with plenty to see.\n\nThe streets nearby are tiny and often one way. We don't recommend driving here unless you have a tiny car","43416":"Let's talk about the good things first : great location in the old town of Ragusa; modern hotel; fantastic small rooftop terrace where we were able to enjoy our breakfast in the morning; finally, lovely staff who were very helpful. The thing that really detracted for me was the size of the rooms : we were a couple travelling, and it was impossible for both of us to have our cases open at the same time; what was worse for me was the bathroom and the very tiny shower in which it's not possible to bend down easily...in fact I didn't know showers came that small. They also had a bidet in there which, while great to have if you have space, should have been sacrificed in favour of a slightly bigger shower. So, whilst we enjoyed our stay here I would probably try and find something with a bit more room if I were to visit Ragusa again.","43417":"If you want a place for tourism this one has an excellent value for price, it is in a beautiful area, the breakfast is high in quality, rooms quite large if you consider the place, all fresh new.\nOnly two cons: first one is that you have to climb a couple of stairs, nothing that could be a problem but better to know it if you have some personal problem, second one there's no park close by..you have to walk 400m circa from the first public parking area.Again, not a big deal but better to know it.\nThe rest is excellent considering the price","43429":"We had room 2 in the main building. The room is on the floor where the breakfast room and roof terrace are located and so we were a little worried it might be noisy Be we heard no noise at all. And from our small but beautifully appointed room we had the most spectacular view over the roof tops and into the valley. I could have looked at it all day. And being up there, we could go out on the terrace to see the rest of the area. And Ragusa is such a lovely little town, the Ibla area especially. We could walk to restaurants and explore. Parking was close enough. We loved our stay.","43431":"We had the hardest time finding Iblaresort even though we had directions, a navigation system and maps, if you blink you will miss it! We ended up pulling over and running into the tourist center for directions and were pointed across the street to the hotel.\n\nThe lobby of the hotel is tiny and very unassuming, you step outside the door and you step into the street. We had booked a Jr. Suite which we were told was across the square in a \"palace\" our friend had booked a standard room in the main building. They showed her the room and asked if she would like to upgrade to a jr suite in our building, she choose to upgrade.\n\nThe walked us across the square, which by the way is surrounded by crumbing dilapidated buildings to the \"palace\" which looked like a ruin and nothing I would consider to be a \"palace\". We had to laugh! However, to our surprise and relief the interior was quite nice. We had both suites so it was also very private. Our suite overlooked the old cathedral and our friends suite overlooked the side street and other buildings. Our friends room was noisy when cars drove down the side street as there was a metal grate in the road that clanged each time. Other than that both rooms had lovely bathrooms, comfortable beds and charming d\u00e9cor. We also had great TV and Wi-Fi\n\nIt is a bit of a hike into the main tourist section of the town, which we visited during the day, but ended up taking a taxi to dinner as my husband was not up to a second \"hike\". However, I think the location is fine for most things you would want to do and see and parking was very convenient as others have pointed out.\n\nBreakfast was average and we ate inside as in Ocotober it was cold in the morning.\n\nAll in all, we would definitely stay again and would recommend this place to friends looking for something out of the ordinary.","43433":"First place we stayed after arriving at Comiso airport around 9pm. Got to hotel around 10-10.30pm they had already advised a free car park a short walk away. Got checked in and the hotel staff advised somewhere nearby where we could have a bite to eat. The hotel feels very small but the room was a good size with a small balcony to relax with a street view and the nearby chiesa Anime Sante Del Purgatorio. Breakfast is served on a lovely little roof terrace and has a wide choice of meats and cheeses plus pastries and cannoli, fruits, juices and of course fresh coffee. We stayed 2 nights while we explored Ragusa. The staff were always helpful with great recommendations during our stay and also when we left for our onward trip.","43435":"A very nice B&B in Ragusa, well decorated, modern bathroom and the service was helpful. The breakfast was good and the terrasse had a nice view on the city. I would recommend this B&B . The parking places are not to far from the hotel.","43437":"Had two nights in the hotel and totally enjoyed our stay. The accommodation was very modern and well appointed. Our host Daniele was so helpful, and on our last night prepared a wonderful platter of his meats and cheese from his own shop as we didn't want to dine out. There is no lift but Daniele and Antonio(we think we remember his name correctly) helped us to our room.","43438":"We stayed in one of the junior suites which is across the street from the main building. Lovely view of the baroque church opposite and a little balcony with chairs. Don't worry about the church clock ringing every 15 minutes (as it does during the day), because it gets turned off at nights! The room was spacious and the shower room was stylish (although another shelf to put things on would have been useful). Wifi was good and USB charging points beside the bed were handy. It's conveniently close to the free tourist car park, so no need to try to drive into the small streets of Ragusa Ibla (which I wouldn't recommend). This delightful town is best discovered on foot and most of the historic buildings have QR codes on the signs so you can download information onto your phone as you wander. However, don't turn down the hotel's free map as online mapping of the tiny streets is less easy to follow. A good breakfast on the rooftop terrace and easy walking to a variety of restaurants. I would have no hesitation about staying here again.","43455":"Spotlessly clean. Claudio and Rosa could not be better hosts or nicer people. Helpful. Full of information. So many extra courtesies. Rooms are as they are portrayed in photographs. Breakfast is crazy Sicilian! We actually stayed longer in Ragusa because we were so happy at this b n b. Quite simply. Nothing to be improved. ! Thank You for a lovely experience.","43459":"Very clean and modern rooms in Ragusa Ibla. If the weather allows you can have breakfast outside hearing the church clocks. Got all you need and if you need recommendations for restaurants and activity\u2019s, the staff will gladly help out.","43479":"We loved Ragusa, and loved Il Duomo Relais! It was my favorite of all the places we stayed in Sicily. I felt happy and at home as soon as we arrived. It is a bit tricky to find, you have to wind around up to the top of the hill on a narrow street, but Katia\u2019s detailed directions helped, and parking was readily available along the street. There are only 4 rooms here, 3 upstairs with balconies and a view of the dome of the duomo and surrounding area. The one downstairs room is directly off the breakfast room and lacks the view, so I would recommend booking upstairs if you can.\n\nIt is a lovely, peaceful place. The room and bed were great, complete with a welcome bottle of wine and almonds to enjoy on the balcony while savoring the view. There were plentiful pillows, and bedside tables with electrical outlets, lamps, and drawers. No dresser, but a wardrobe with a shelf and an ottoman in the corner which I used for my clothes. Katia was able to provide some extra hangers on request. There\u2019s a refrigerator and a safe. The bathroom had good lighting and good water pressure in the shower, big fluffy bath towels and robes, a shelf for toiletries and two robe hooks. Could have used a hook or ring for the hand towel, otherwise everything was well laid out for a comfortable stay.\n\nBest of all was our wonderful hostess, Katia. She was very gracious, welcoming and helpful. Each morning she welcomed us to breakfast and outlined the day\u2019s offerings, which varied somewhat \u2013 caprese one day, torta another, etc. There was always meat and cheese, breads, yogurt, cereal, fruit, juice, and assorted pastries, including little cannoli which she filled to order. There was a coffee\/tea\/hot cocoa machine available around the clock, as well as fresh fruit and candied almonds.\n\nThe location is very central, close to the duomo, though you will get a workout climbing up the steps each day.","43481":"Our last 4 night stay was in Ragusa. Katia and her husband could not have been more welcome to my family! Upon arrival she gave us a breakdown of the city's layout and her restaurant recommendations as well as the price ranges! We were shown to our rooms by her husband and he was kind enough to show us all the features of each room and how to work the A\/C.\n\nEvery morning Katia welcomed us with a beautiful breakfast spread that always included fresh ricotta on toast with honey (the family favorite) as well as recommendations for any day trips we may be taking that morning. Unfortunately it rained for 2 days out of our stay but Katia provided multiple umbrellas for our use and having a cozy home base was lovely. Truly the best example of Sicilian hospitality!\n\nOur room had a small balcony overlooking the main Duomo where I spent many hours sketching and people watching.\n\nDon't be fooled as we were, there IS plenty of street parking if you go past the hotel and up to a large parking area. We were very concerned as we drove up the thin windy roads but fear not, we always had a parking spot!","43483":"On a recent one-week tour of Sicily, we made a point to stay in the very lovely city of Ragusa, at Il Duomo Relais. We simply cannot say enough positive things about our stay!\n\nWe booked the Terra Room, with its balcony overlooking the Duomo di San Giorgio. The room was well-appointed and spotlessly clean.\n\nFor breakfast, an absolutely delightful assortment of pastries, jams and local delicacies was presented by Katia, the wonderful owner of Il Duomo Relais. I was surprised and so pleased to be able to taste the world-famous chocolate from nearby Modica!\n\nLast, a lovely place to stay in a perfect location was made significantly better by Katia. She is a wonderful communicator, is helpful in every way, and when we arrived to town, she even insisted on picking us up at the train station. This type of service and commitment to clients is so rare, and we wish to give you a very special thank you, Katia.\n\nIf we return to Ragusa, we will not hesitate to stay at Il Duomo Relais again!","43486":"A family-run B&B with hard-working Katia at the helm, il Duomo Relais has only a few rooms but has enormous charm. Our room afforded a stunning view of the Duomo in this amazing, cliffside village. Katia's breakfast spread was amazing, with several homemade sweets. Parking is available for those who, like us, were traveling by car.","43489":"We only spent 1 night here, but I could\u2019ve stayed longer! Katia met us when we arrived and she\u2019s the type of person that you instantly like: warm, friendly and caring. We had a room on the first floor with a beautiful white canopy bed and a view of the Duomo! Everything in the room was beautiful and clean! There was a coffee maker and fruit right outside our door. Katia gave us a map of the area and our keys and we didn\u2019t see her again until the morning when she arrived to prepare a feast for breakfast! There were pastries, meats, cheeses, lemon jelly (yum), juices and more! It was delicious! Don\u2019t think twice about staying here! It\u2019s beautiful! There are a LOT of stairs down to the square, but that\u2019s everywhere in Ragusa Ibla. The parking was great: right in front!","43490":"Although I have not ended up staying here (with great regret), I feel the need to let people know about the service I have received from Katia.\n\nWe have been emailing each other for the last couple weeks. Her prompt emails and replies to all of my requests have been excellent. Katia offered options for all my plans included upgraded my room to transportation.\n\nMy plans changed due to trains not running on Sunday unfortunately. I can not wait to make it to Ragusa one day and stay here for sure!!","43493":"Beautiful location with a view of the Duomo's dome, and lots of help and good local recommendations from friendly host. A few minutes walk to the main square - but be ready for steps. This is a town built on hills. An excellent array of breakfast choices!","43494":"We stayed at the Ignis room for two nights and this was the best B&B of our Sicily trip. Room was clean, generous in size and beautifully decorated and equipped with modern quality fittings such as USB cable charging points. The location was perfect as the B&B is perched on the hill just above the duomo with views of the valley and so it was calm and peaceful but still within a 3 min walk down the stairs to the main piazza. Breakfast was very good and above the standard of similar B&B (local cheese and produce, cannoli, fresh fruit, cereal etc). Katia the owner was very helpful and gave us some useful restaurant recommendations.","43499":"Perfect place to stay in Ragusa, this property has been beautifully & meticulously refurbished. Only 4 rooms, all with fantastic views. We stayed in \u2018Aqua\u2019 lovely big room & big bathroom. Big comfy bed & latex pillows as requested. Quality linen & towels. Good WiFi. Fantastic yummy breakfast, fresh fruit ( ripe to eat now)some typical regional food, fresh pastries, cannoli, etc plus savoury meat eggs etc\nBig plus is that this property is managed by the owner.\nKatia is absolutely delightful, in touch before our arrival. Good recommendation for restaurants e.g. La Bettola - great\nNote: there is no lift\nI highly recommend this property - fantastic location","43506":"My husband & I spent three wonderful nights at this charming B&B. Overlooking the duomo, it is centrally located in Ragusa Ibla with ample parking on the street. We stayed in the lovely and cozy Terra room. Il Duomo Relais is modern & immaculately clean. The owners, Katia & Giuseppe, were incredibly hospitable. Katia\u2019s breakfast buffet was the most delicious we had in Sicily! Personal touches like the Nespresso machine in the lobby & bottles of wine available on the honor system were greatly appreciated. And did I mention the wonderful aroma of the towels & bedding? We loved Il Duomo Relais & would highly recommend if you are traveling to Ragusa!","43509":"Dear Katia and Giuseppe,\n\nThank you for a really lovely stay on our first two nights of our honeymoon in Sicily. Our hosts very kindly stayed at the hotel close to 11pm to welcome us from a delayed flight from the UK and made us feel very welcome including a bottle of prosecco to help us celebrate.\n\nVery comfortable large room with a fridge on the ground floor of a perfectly placed boutique hotel with perfect views of the Duomo. A really lovely and beautifully presented, local specialty based breakfast and a great coffee machine too that you can use throughout the day which is a bonus.\n\nBe careful that Google Maps sent us the wrong way down a one-way street (twice, oops) just as you see the Duomo. So if you find yourself driving up the right-hand side of the Duomo, you\u2019re about to go the wrong way down a one-way street!! Free parking on the street outside, which is handy. Stayed mid-September and it was lovely weather and a lovely stay.\n\nThanks again, Katia and Giuseppe, would definitely stay again.","43510":"Perfect hotel in the heart of Ragusa Ibla - looking out of our bedroom window at the Duomo. Friendly owner with a passion for excellence. Could fault nothing with our stay. Our journey to the Hotel was interesting and thank goodness for Tom Tom but well worth it.","43511":"Il Duomo Relais is a special place to stay in case you visit Ragusa. Location is perfect with a stunning view of Duomo di San Giorgio. Katia (the owner) is super friendly and welcoming and does everything possible in order to make you feel at home. My wife and myself had a memorable staying. On top of that the breakfast is great with amazing local food. We definitely recommend this Relais to everyone.","43525":"Pleasant room [Terra] on first floor- steep staircase , good Duomo views, hearty local produce breakfast and friendly service.\nUnsuitable for elderly unfit since many, many , tricky steps down to town and back up!!!!.\nCar access extremely difficult due to one way streets -some impassable. At our wits end ,consulted local police car and they drove with us to hotel!\nTomTom coordinates inaccurate beware!\nParking is free in the street outside but only if there is space. If no space , suggest a Hotel letterhead\/ booking copy on dashboard as signs say only local residents, threatening tow away!!\nLots of the good restaurants with no available tables, so must book before arrival.","43559":"Really enjoyed our stay here. Lovely place. Modern and stylish rooms with a beautiful pool. The owners\/managers run themselves and ensure you feel welcome and give the place a lot of personal touches e.g. handmade soap.","43611":"So lucky to have found this wonderful apartment for a weekend away. Aldo and his sister were perfect hosts, very friendly and warm.\nThe apartment was very spacious, full of history and old charm. An abundant library of books in the lounge room, a beautiful piano and gorgeous shutters overlooking terra-cotta rooftops, especially beautiful at night with the full moon! The bed was extremely comfortable, there is a large bathroom and modern air conditioning. There\u2019s a fridge and coffee making facilities.\nBreakfast is served on the outdoor terrace on the second floor. Beautiful classical music plays in the background. There\u2019s a selection of homemade deliciousness including pot set yoghurt, homemade strawberry and orange jam, local honey, biscuits typical of Ragusa, fresh baked bread, salamis, ham and cheese. We were also treated to a fresh croissant filled with custard and ricotta and a sweet milk creamy pudding (Biancomangiare ) with cinnamon.\nRight next door there is a wonderful restaurant and across the road a cute trattoria specializing in wines.\nThe main piazza is an extremely short distance away. Location of the apartment is excellent and you\u2019re able to walk everywhere. Parking was right inside the apartment driveway (the family moved their cars for us!) very generous as parking is extremely hard to find especially on weekends. Thank you for a very memorable weekend away in Ragusa, we will be back.","43616":"We cannot find enough words of praise for this excellent accommodation. Aldo and his parents were such an excellent hosts.\nApartment is located in old, historical building, equipped with extraordinary furniture, piano and sooo many books. Breakfast on the terrace was an extra bonus, although the aparment for itself doesn`t need any bonus. Way the best accommodation we`ve had in our 8 days travel to Sicily\nThe only mistake was made by us: we stayed too short in this remarkable place\nYou should introduce six* rate only for them\nRegards from Maja, Sandra & Natali","43630":"This quietly situated grand family home is in an excellent location in the heart of Ragusa Ibla, the historic and beautiful old town shown in the opening shots of the Inspector Moltobano TV series. Our two rooms were enormous. The sitting room walls were lined with books and pictures and contained a piano. The English- speaking family (two youngish brothers and their parents) who own the place are delightful. The delicious breakfast is taken upstairs in their apartment. As the weather was good we were served outside on the terrace. We particularly appreciated the home made yogurt and marmalade. The only negative is that the bedroom was not well lit.","43634":"Last minute booking. Lovely clean room. Very helpful host Aldo. Suggested good restaurant. Best is ease of parking. Very close to centre of town. Quirky but nice. 60 euros for the night. Suite had three doubles and a cot in two rooms and mezzanine. Just two of us.","43694":"It pays to do your homework. We knew enough to request their larger, book-filled apartment in the main palazzo. What a difference. We loved it for the 5 days of our stay, especially when a heatwave chased us back inside now and again. The cool room, with its cooler fridge contents, was perfect. But not as perfect as the wonderful hosts. The above and beyond help that was consistently on offer, plus the lovingly-prepared, unique breakfasts out on the terrace, made this a B+B to remember. Truly outstanding value. Get Ondina to tell you about her days as a lion tamer with the Moscow Circus.","43698":"Wonderful place, great location staff very helpful and friendly and happy to help me with all our queries, pleasant hotel. You can have a wide variaty of food for breakfast. The hotel is located precisely in the old town centre, free parking nearby. Room was very clean and practical. Nice stay. Hope to come back soon.","43706":"Big spotless room with a door out to a small deck with table and chairs made this stop delightful. View from the deck was across to the ancient city. Fab breakfast. Recommend Maggie and Sandra Australia","43711":"Terra del Sole Ibla was a budget B&B located in the lower part of the hill looking to the old city of Ragusa Ibla. Free parking was possible in front of the building which was at 10 minutes walking distance to the old square. Our first floor room with airconditioner was clean and good in size. The bathroom was ok. The mattress was a bit uncomfortable. There was a small balcony from which the view over the old city was limited. I think chosing the second floor room could be more appropriate for uninterrupted city views. The hosts were super friendly. The wifi connection was good. The breakfast was given in small cave and it was included in the room rate.","43775":"Very nice Hotel,but hard to find on GPS,which never seems to know that some locations are on one way streets!\nIt was Sunday and everything was closed,except for a cafe connected to the Hotel.\nParking was free on the Bridge next to the Hotel (one way) as it was Sunday.\nHotel room was very nice and staff were pleasant and helpful.\nBreakfast was good and the Hotel good value for money.\nThe area around the Cathedral suddenly came alive in the evening,fortunately...but until that time,it was depressing to walk around with everything closed.\nThe only good thing about Sunday...was the free parking!","43780":"We have been there from 17 October to 21 October 2019 Wifi very weak. Restaurant Staff very rude they serve the plates arrogantly with just small portions and no choice. The shower on the bath with no space to move it can be easily to slip on.\n\nNo Suggestion to go there","43781":"Stayed here for 3 nights. Reception processing was good.\nRoom was very basic. It was a double room, two hard chairs, hard floor, dreadful looking units. WiFi In the room was flakey. Not to 4 star standard.\nThere were no bar or lounge facilities, couldn\u2019t see any nearby and no local information provided in the room, so after eating there was nowhere to go. Again would expect a 4 star hotel to have a bar.\nBreakfast was a typical Italian hotel buffet. Nothing wrong with it except the coffee was always cold but nothing special either.\nDinner was taken in the hotel. Food was warm not hot. It was ok, but it was certainly not fine dining it was more mass catering. Service was ok. Dining room staff speak little English.\nHotel is situated on the edge of a shopping precinct. No direct vehicle access to the front of the hotel. The nearby shops tend to be designer items.","43783":"Decent size room but a bit \"plasticky\". The bed was large and comfortable. The bathroom looked ok but the shower was utterly lethal - so very very slippery. It was also quite difficult to control the temperature.\nOur group dinner was only fair. The risotto had a strange taste and the sauce over the meat was a bit glutinous.\nBreakfast was adequate. The croissants were very dry and the luke warm water made a diabolical cup of tea.\nThere is only ONE lift. This is for those staying here and also for luggage. The more able took to the stairs.\nNot a brilliant position in the town.\nI certainly wouldn't return!","43785":"The hotel appeared modern and clean but they only supply one door card which is inserted to power everything. So couples can\u2019t split up and go in different directions. The tv had 6 channels, all in Italian. The coffee machine didn\u2019t work. The plugs are designed for 3 prongs so a standard 2 prong adapter generally won\u2019t work.\nInternet is pretty slow- forget uploading photos.\nOnly 1 person at check in for an entire bus full of tourists.\nMeals seemed good but am a bit nervous of after effects after reading previous reviews!\nThere is no, or very little ventilation in the bathroom so a shower quickly elevated the humidity and the partial shower screen is inadequate to prevent water from splashing onto the floor.\nThese issues would be enough to convince me not to stay again if we made a return visit to the area.","43786":"I was on the same tour as the previous reviewer. I know the first lot of the c.6 that went down with viral gastroenteritis fell ill within 12 hours of getting to the hotel. It can take up to three days for the symptoms to develop. This was our third full day of our holiday. Possibly caught it on the plane as our group came from two airports. From what I remember, all of the members that got sick, all came from the same flight.\n\nBack to the review of the hotel. Some of us have read reviews of this hotel before staying here and were put off with reviews of dark dingy rooms. I had a massive room which was on the front with two windows. Even looking at the floor plan on the back of the door (fire route), there was perhaps, one room out of 30-33 on the floor which was looking very small. Doubt if everyone stayed in that room.\n\nOne problem that guessing about a quarter to a third of us had was our room safes were not working. I put my passport and gadgets locked in suitcase.\n\nThough in my room, I had plenty of hanging space for my clothes and plug points by the bed.\n\nOne lift isn't enough for a hotel used by touring groups as they leave and return to the hotel in large numbers, I did use the stairs on more times than the lift, but felt that the stairwell needs better lighting as myself and a few others slipped on the last stair.\n\nBreakfast was full of great choices - though need to get more larger cups as foreigners (there were American and French groups) like their big cups and one day, there were none available as all been used","43787":"Visited on a group holiday. The listed bar is actually a public bar next door and there is no bar inside the hotel. My air conditioning did not work. The bath plug leaked, there was no cable TV and the electronic key failed after one use. Several of our group came down with a viral gastro enteritis while we were there.","43788":"This hotel was well situated close to shopping and dining. We had a problem with the air conditioning and after repeated assistance it didn\u2019t cool off the room enough. The phone went out and was not fixed during our stay. The shower was super tiny. Otherwise the hotel was alright.","43790":"Stayed one night here as part of tour group. Overall quite ok with a few little quirks. The room was spacious enough as was the bathroom but the shower was only fit for a child or very tiny hobbit. The breakfast was buffet style and adequate but could be improved. The dinner was ok but we had no choice with that. I found the beds comfortable enough. There was only on elevator and it was very slow so we mostly walked the stairs. We didn\u2019t really have anything to do with the staff as the tour guide handled that but the wait staff were quite brusque.","43804":"We were here as part of a tour group. It seems that this is the only large modern hotel available in this preferred location with shops and eateries just outside the front door. Lobby is modern but sterile. Rooms are modern and spacious with comfortable beds but the bathroom we had was terrible. The tap was awkwardly positioned towards the left of the sink instead of the usual center. The bath was terribly slow in drainage and resulted in a lot of foam left behind. Also, the shower screen panel was too small and hence the bathroom became flooded with water after each shower. I'm not too sure about other rooms but did not request for a change since it was only a one night stay. That said, the breakfast room was great; bright and cheerful with glass paneling to enjoy the view of town outside.","43808":"Had to walk across the bridge because Bus was not allowed here. The hotel is located on the edge of Ragusa and seems very modern. This is considered to be the NEW area of Ragusa after the earthquake.\n\nWell received at the hotel and the service was very good, again a nice breakfast.","43819":"Stayed one night with Jolly Tour. Modern room. Comfortable. Good free wifi. Good breakfast. Located short walk from Cathedral. Our bus had to park on far side of bridge over gorge. Porters moved bags to and from hotel. Walls\/doors a little thin.","43820":"We enjoyed our stay at this hotel very much. Our bedroom was clean and bright, the bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was well equipped. We arrived at the bus station in Ragusa and took a taxi to the hotel (\u20ac10). Later, when we walked to the bus station, we found that it took 20 minutes. The train station is a similar distance. The hotel itself has an underground car park, and is a short walk from the cathedral of Ragusa and a variety of restaurants. The archaeological museum is immediately below the hotel. Ragusa-Ibla is within easy walking distance (there are a lot of steps) and there are buses to bring you back to Piazza della Liberta, close to the hotel. The buffet breakfast seemed to cater for all tastes, though the bacon and scrambled egg did not look enticing. The staff were attentive and friendly. At a price of around \u20ac72 per night it was extremely good value.","43824":"The Place is a Best Western OK? While the Staff does put a Wonderful Italian Charm to everything. The Breakfast is standard Italian Buffet which does out shine their American Counter Part. The Rooms are NOT as Spacious as the pictures make them out to be. The camera may not Lie but a good Photographer can Bend the Truth! And there is the Rub!!! Oh and I have yet to see a Dinner Service!","43838":"Stayed there last month as part of a tour group. Passports taken on arrival and told to collect after dinner. When I went to collect they were all on the reception desk which was totally unattended. I could of walked off with the lot and so could any body comming in of the street. Not good. The restaurant was terrible. Grossly under staffed and very poor food. We had booked a twin room and got a room with two beds pushed together and made up as one. Not what we had asked for and it left a narrow gap either side to stand in to get in to bed. The air con could only be adjusted at reception, not in the room. The wifi did not work in the room. There was supposed to be a Tea and Coffee machine in the room but it only turned up on the afternoon of our last day and only made expresso. My wife was told by a member of staff not to go out of an evening for safety reasons.","43840":"Food cold and tasteless\nLack of hot and cold water on 2x nights very low pressure on taps\nMain bedroom ok comfortable but bathroom could do with update\nNo bar in hotel the nearest was next door but closed all day and night Wednesdays","43841":"I don't remember eating worse food on holiday anywhere. I can't believe that the staff at the hotel would have eaten it. It was miserable canteen food casually slopped on to a plate. They only get away with it because of the language barrier.\nThe room was bleak but clean and it had a comfortable bed. There is a nice bar adjacent to the hotel but this is a separate business.","43862":"The B&B is conveniently situated right between Ragusa Ibla and Ragusa Superior; therefore, if you are lucky, you get the room facing the side of Ragusa Ibla so that each morning you wake up to a magnificent view of the old city outside of your window!\n\nWith only three rooms, Simone takes personal care of each of his guest -accommodating, helpful and funny. He will be the friend that you badly need when you are traveling in a foreign country. What's more, the WiFi works and hot water does not run out after 5 minutes! With this price? It's a steal! Just a word of note: one room has its bathroom outside across the hallway (private, though).","43866":"Staying here was the highlight of my visit to Sicily. My room opened directly onto a balcony with views over the old town. It was amazing to watch day turn to night, as the buildings lit up and then to see the different colours in the morning as the sun rose. Simone was the most thoughtful of hosts, answering all my questions and making the necessary arrangements to suit me both before and during my visit. Delicious home cooked cake and coffee on the balcony for breakfast topped off the magical experience!\n\nThe whole apartment is very clean and thoughtfully arranged to make it a great place to stay. I enjoyed the company of other guests also staying here, which added to the pleasure, but it's also possible to have complete privacy if you wish.\n\nThe location is also excellent for accessing both parts of Ragusa and there is a bus stop just outside the b&b for buses in both directions.\n\nVery highly recommended.","43867":"Wonderful hospitality from the owner Simone who is a thoroughly nice, friendly young man who makes you feel relaxed and at home in his B&B. Nice breakfast with freshly baked cake every morning. It is also spotlessly clean. Simone is very helpful with information about the area and transport. The property is in a spectacular location with stunning views over Ragusa Ibla from some of the bedrooms. Ragusa superiore is also easily accessed from here. I would not stay anywhere else if I were to go to that area again.","43892":"This b&b is just amazing. The staff is very helpful, the location is just perfect, the room was clean and beautiful, also there is a kitchen which you can use without any limits. And of course, the view is amazing, it's hard to leave the balcony! Such an inspiring place!","43953":"The place is pretty but not suitable for a quiet vacation. We were six people in three rooms. We stayed there for three nights. We never met the owner, and no one we met could speak English. The house is located on a busy road with traffic that makes it unpleasant to sit outside by the pool. It feels like sitting in a parking lot. On Friday night the patio outside our rooms was rented for a birthday party of an 18 years old girl. They installed huge loudspeakers and a DJ played extremely loud music. The loud music went on from 9:30 PM, accompanied by fireworks close to midnight, until close to 1 AM. The next morning the owner wrote to me a Whatsapp message explaining that \u201cthe music was lowered at 12.30 well below the municipal regulations fixing that cut-off time at 2 am \u201c. The owner thinks it is right to have a party outside your room because it may be legal according to municipal regulations. So if you come here you must be prepared to share your night with a teenage party. My suggestion: AVOID!","43999":"Couldn't have wished for a nicer welcome. Room very clean and a typical Sicillian breakfast was provided every morning. Lucca recommended several eateries and places for us to visit - diolch yn fawr iawn. Wendy a Rhys Hughes","44000":"We discovered Ragusa it was the highlight of our trip last September to Sicily.\nAngelo and Luca were the best hosts you could imagine.The terrasse was inviting and the breakfast delicious .Right in the heart of Ragusa, we found bus trips to explore the region, restaurants and more have to go back","44010":"Angelo and Luca could not have been more helpful. The arranged a taxi to pick us up at the airport, gave us all the information and guidance we needed for Ragusa and other places.\nThe B and B is in a great location beside the Cathedral and within walking distance to Ragusa Ibla. Plenty of good restaurants and bars nearby.\nThe highlight of the trip though was breakfast with Angelo. He plays jazz and opera, sings along and brings delicious Sicilian delights to try. Lemon granita, mulberry and pomegranate granita, the best ricotta I have ever tried. And much more!\nA great spot and wonderful hosts.","44040":"We thoroughly enjoyed 4 days at the B&B because of Angelo's warm hospitality, the wonderfully quiet, comfortable room ( Sciascia ) with a view of the Chiesa di San Giovanni and a modern bathroom, the delicious, ample, and varied breakfast each morning, and the very central but tranquil location on a side street.\n\nBe sure to dine at the nearby Trattoria Da Luigi at Corso Vittorio Veneto, 96. Beautifully prepared local cuisine at a very fair price!\n\nAlso, be sure to visit the nearby pasticerria Bar Olimpico at Via Salvatore, 12. The owner creates brilliant sweets hardly seen elsewhere in Sicily!","44054":"Very tastefully renovated old place with comfortable warm rooms and spacious bathroom. Giancarlo is a very helpful host who seems very passionate about Ragusa Ibla which is a gem. He was a gentlemen helping us carry our bikes 2 flights of stairs to park in our room since there wasn't space anywhere else.","44132":"In the breathtaking pittoresque city of Ragusa is a little oasis of a hotel located. Delicatly and tastefully designed throughout, in the middle of a small street with restaurants (mostly local Sicilian cousine, but also vegetarian and sushi\/japanese), 2-3 bars and all kind of shops in the immediate surrounding.\n\nThe kettle for tea\/coffee and the free minibar in the room was highly appreciated. There were also a kitchen\/eatingroom where it\u2019s possible to make, store and eat self-prepared food and an espresso machine and a selection of teas. Cosy, neat and clean.\n\nThe bathroom has thick and luxurious towels, toiletteries, power in the shower and of course all fresh, new and well-designed.\n\nThe beds are good to sleep in and the room is practically soundproof.\n\nThe host was helpful, polite and nice and we felt very welcome.\n\nWe will be back!","44143":"We were supposed to be staying in a different hotel and were only informed a day before travel that we had been transferred to this one due to \"upkeep\". That the original hotel had a pool and garden for relaxing was very attractive to us. The De Stefano was not an adequate replacement.\n\nThe hotel is a quirky boutique hotel but certainly not luxury. The shower cubicle was the smallest I have ever seen other than on a boat or caravan. I had to enter sideways and then there was hardly room to move. There were no drawers in the room and the wardrobe was very shallow and the doors could not be opened fully as they were obstructed by the bedside table. I\u2019d say Premier Inn standard at best (but even there we\u2019d have a bath tub and a sofa. And working wifi). There was very little space to hang wet bath towels or beach stuff, and in 4 days things just didn\u2019t dry. The room safe kept resetting itself and having to be unlocked by the staff.\n\nThe hotel room doors are not well soundproofed and the management preference is to play musak in the common areas through speakers in the ceilings; musak which was loud enough to be a constant irritation inside the bedroom through the non-soundproofed door. We had to ask several times for it to be turned off, once at 11.30pm! The wifi was unavailable more often than not, despite having possibly the longest wifi password in the world. On the subject of the manager, the hotel seemed to be run by three very pleasant young men, but the manager was never in evidence.\n\nThere are no pleasant areas to sit and relax around the hotel, no outside space. In the room we had one desk chair and otherwise the only place to relax was on the bed which is not ideal when you are an older person.\n\nBreakfast was OK, but didn't change day to day. The best thing about the hotel was the young man making the excellent breakfast coffee.\n\nThe spa and swimming pool are only available for personal booking. We did try them out and were able to swim a little but the pool is really too small for exercise, more of a large Jacuzzi.\n\nMy husband who is generally a tolerant man said on day 3, \u201cit\u2019s been a lovely day I just wish we didn\u2019t have to go back to that weird hotel\u201d. Which sums it up really. When we got back on the last night the maid had taken our personal tea mugs and they had disappeared. We never got them back.\n\nWhile the location was still a good base for exploring the area, the hotel did not live up to expectations in many respects.","44153":"Nice hotel located in the baroque area of the city, and extremely nice people working on it.\nthere was a problem with my reservation and the manager INMEDIATLY gave us a solution. Congratulations. Another satisfied customer.","44162":"This hotel is in an old palace. The rooms are quite nicely decorated. Finding your room can be tricky, as there are many levels and stairways to traverse. The breakfast is very nice, but the air conditioning is ineffectual and the wifi irregular.","44163":"The Destefano palace is not a luxury hotel. It is in an old villa and as such could not be changed. The rooms are small, the bathroom is tiny with a shower that is really tiny. Air conditioning is poor, we had to get a fan because the temperature of our bedroom never went below 80 degrees. Very little service. Our room was not even made up one day. On the plus side, the breakfast was good. We would not stay here again.","44165":"I have some rather mixed feelings about this hotel. I would call it a boutique hotel but certainly not a luxury one for a number of reasons.\n\nFirstly, honesty at this hotel is quite questionable. We booked our stay with access to the spa included. The day before our arrival we received an email saying that due to some recent issues with high chlorine levels, the spa is currently closed. During check in, the receptionist told us that the spa actually had to be closed on the day of our arrival, and on the other hand, from other reviews on other websites it is clear that the spa has been closed either for a number of months, or on several occasions in the past months. I find it very unfair that they try to attract bookings by offering free access to the spa (I understand it can normally be used at a cost), when clearly they have an issue. On a positive note, they did offer the possibility to make use of the spa in one of their partner hotels, however I did not find this very convenient.\n\nSecondly, a 1.5m x 1.0m bathroom for the standard doubleroom is not quite luxurious. The shower itself is incredibly tiny and there is barely any space to move your arms while showering.\n\nDuring our stay, I have asked for an iron. In the morning I was told that it was unavailable. In the evening I was told the same, but I insisted on having one delivered to the room. An iron was delivered after a few minutes, but an ironing board not. I was asked to use the available desk instead!\n\nHaving said that, the entrance and reception area are very nicely designed, and the decor in the rooms is also pleasant. Also, breakfast was good and the guy taking care of the breakfast area was very nice and helpful. I also appreciated the fact that on the day of departure, we had to leave earlier than the opening times for breakfast, and the receptionist still opened the area for us to have some food.","44178":"This is a property designed for Lilliputians where design triumphs over function. Tiny rooms with narrow closets and no drawers. Tiny bathrooms with minimal shelf space and phone booth shower stalls. MIA so-called central a\/c. Tiny breakfast room. All nicely done in modern Italian style but lacking practicality. Nice staff though. But as a hotel certainly not deserving four stars, if such stars are meant to conform to the generally accepted standards of comfort.","44179":"Stayed for 3 nights and I would say De Stefano is more like a business hotel than a luxury hotel.\n\nLocation- pretty good, the old town is within walking distance so it has been easy to get around. Parking is a little difficult, you have to drop your luggage quickly and go find street parking. The roads are really narrow around here so it's best to drive small cars.\n\nProperty- Pretty cool that the hotel is converted from a Palazzo but I found the added amenities a little cheap looking. Made the hotel feel more like a business hotel\n\nRoom- The room was comfortable and had super high ceilings so it felt big but the toilet is comically small. I am 150cm and come from Hong Kong so I'm used to small spaces but even I found the shower tiny.\n\nService- The service was a bit of a let down. The receptionist who checked us in didn't seem to know anything or where our room was!! There was no room service, they couldn't book a spa treatment, everything seemed to be \"No we can't do this\" for one reason or another.\n\nSpa- We had a rainy day so booked a morning in the spa (without treatment). It was fine and we had to pay 20 euros per person.\n\nBreakfast- Not very good, no hot breakfast. The breakfast room also felt a bit drab. However the lady who served the breakfast was great, very good English and very friendly.","44183":"We stayed at this hotel after the agriturismo we booked had no aircon and it was over 40C in Sicily.\n\nThe hotels aircon packed up and they didn't manage to fix it, or offer to move us. Not what you would expect from a 4* hotel. There were even comments in the comment book saying that this had happened before.\n\nAdditionally, the spa bath didn't work completely, which would never happen in a Hilton type hotel.\n\nLocation is okay, its a short drive to Ragusa Iblea (the sceneic part), but there isn't much to do around the hotel itself except visit the cathedral.","44220":"This place was hard to find for us on a very busy saturday afternoon. So if that is your day come early to park your car. The room was perfect, with very comfy beds, the best we have had in 2 weeks Sicily! Guiseppe, the host, is doing even more than extremely his best: at breakfast we were not suppost to do anything ourselves. We found that a little bit too much, but the place is really very good!","44222":"Modern cleverly renovated guest house in an old terrace off the main drag in Iblea. Spotlessly clean and well thought out spacious design. Close to the gardens and a 5 minute walk to the cathedral.\nGuiseppe is a warm host and very helpful. Parking with the permit is a breeze. Breakfasts are excellent and include the absolutely delicious, but extremely filling, cream croissants. Pistachio was our favourite.\nWould happily come back here.\nGrazie Giuseppe.","44227":"Very modern, clean, well-designed guest house. Comfortable beds, quiet location, excellent breakfast with home-made jam. Extremely well-located for exploring the whole of Ragusa. Parking available in street outside.","44230":"Aura is in an excellent location in Ragusa Ibla. It is quiet and close to lovely public gardens and not far from all the main attractions.\nGiuseppe has thought of everything. His friendly welcome and helpful advice makes Aura a must. The bedrooms and bathrooms are spacious and very well finished. He has ensured that he has covered all bases including the little things.\nOn a practical note Aura is very close to \u2018parcheggio pubblica\u2019 which is easy to drive to and close by. Giuseppe will also organise resident parking if you prefer.","44231":"Guiseppe is a man of few words; but his B&B is so spic and span that you would think twice about sullying it. The room we got was the kitchen of his old house. The way he has done his old family home into a B&B is a revelation. He has even got a rain shower in the bathroom. Everything is 'precise'. For breakfast he asks what croissant (filling) one would need. :D\nI loved that there was a place to hang washed clothes in the balcony. Sicilian sun dries everything in 2 hours!! Guiseppe told us where to eat and what to see.\nWhile in Ragusa, stay here.","44233":"We loved, loved this place. Everything was so well thought of - room modern, quiet & bright, fast internet, heater in shower, rain shower, extra blankets\/pillows, umbrellas for rainy days, delicious breakfast, great views, first floor rooms. Free car park available behind. Giuseppe is truly commended for his hospitality. :smiley:","44235":"I can only confirm what everyone else has already written. The only (minor) downsides were (a) not receiving any information about a taxi from the airport until we'd given up and booked with another company (with a crazy driver!), (b) nobody answering the bell when we arrived so we had to hang around outside for about 20 minutes (the aforementioned crazy taxi driver said he'd rung the phone number but it turned out he was just having us on and trying to persuade us to go to a place run by a friend of his) and (c) the TV being on during breakfast. I especially appreciated the shower, the excellent wifi, the vegan croissants, fruit, Giovanni's mother's sun-dried tomatoes, his father's olives & the endless supply of green tea and, once I'd realized that my waterproof jacket was no longer waterproof, the umbrellas provided for the use of guests.\nWe were so pleased that the place we'd originally tried to book couldn't accommodate us for the full week.\nFor the return drive to Catania airport we used the taxi of Guiseppe's brother, Amedeo, who was an excellent driver.\nQuiet location yet very handy for buses, the park and some excellent restaurants.\nWe'd definitely stay again if visiting Ragusa.","44236":"Well done Giuseppe! You're a star. With meticulous attention to detail, you've created a perfect little 'home from home Sicilian style' for exploring Ragusa and Montalbano country.\nWhen we were lost on arrival, you drove out to meet us and lead our car to the Aura. Your recommendations on where to eat and how to see the Montalbano locations were excellent. The rooms you have designed are modern, efficient, and spotlessly clean. The breakfast is Sicilian with home-made items from your mum.\nThe location is perfect for walking around and eating in Ibla, and catching the bus up to Ragusa and walking back down.\nAll capped by your courteous charm and caring personality.\nYou made Ragusa special for us.Your parents must be proud!","44241":"The hospitality, location, and overall feel of the B&B was amazing! The sheets were clean, the bathroom was perfectly sized, and the staff were very welcoming. It is much nicer than other hotels and is very family friendly. Within the bathroom, they also offered soap and shampoo, just in case the guests ran out. The breakfast is ordered daily in the morning and the guests have a choice on what is ordered. The prices are also very reasonable. My overall opinion on the B&B is that the rooms are clean and modern, the hospitality is better than four star hotels, and the location is amazing!","44242":"We are 2 adults and 2 teenagers stayed here in July. The owner of this B&B, Giuseppe, is a very young guy with great ambitions and attention to the smallest details to make your stay the most comfortable and enjoyable. His hotel is in a old, historic building right in the old town, in Ragusa Ibla but it has all the supper modern conveniences inside: memory mattress and pillows, excellent modern appliances in the bathroom, massage shower, air conditioner, sofa, balcony. The breakfast had nice variety of cheeses, sausages, olives, fresh ricotta from the market. When you arrive you will be offered a welcome juice or other drink and you can try products made from chocolate from the neighboring Modica. Giuseppe gave us a good advice to park our car, take a public bus to the top of the city, which is also interesting to see and then gradually walk down to the Ragusa Ibla, you can see beautiful views from the top. Overall, Ragusa was the most interesting, beautiful, colorful and lively of all baroque towns in Sicily. You must eat in Cantunera Ibla, its 2 minutes walk fro the hotel and has truly the most delicious arancini of our 2.5 weeks in Sicily!","44243":"Great location, amazing value for money (so much detail and effort has gone into this place), better than some 5 star hotels. Car park just around the corner and the city is so beautiful. Breakfast is also very good and the beds are so comfy.","44244":"Aura Guest House is in a perfect location. It is situated at one end of Ragusa Ibla near the garden as well as some excellent restaurants. Besides being very convenient for walking throughout Ragusa Ibla, parking was also very easy. Giuseppe was a great host and he obviously takes great pride in Aura House. The rooms are very modern and clean, and the bed comfortable. We would definitely stay here again!","44246":"We had a beautiful room with a small balcony, soft towels, comfortable mattress. Everything appeared to be new and of high quality.\nGiuseppe is dedicated to his guests. He helped us find free parking, and gave us excellent suggestions for touring the area.\nThe breakfast was wonderful with the choice of freshly baked croissant, local cheeses and salamis, fruits, gems, a delicious fresh ricotta, and more. We enjoyed our stay.","44271":"1, it's between the new & old ragusa, free parking in front of the b&b. 2, Modern design, it's cold to my friend's taste, but practical to me. 3, breakfast is rich, owner is nice, gave us a lot info. 4, during our stay, the entrance door isn't easy to close, owner told us how, we had no sucess","44357":"We stayed here for the last night of our Secret Sicily tour. It must have been the end of season as there didn't seem to be any other residents. Our large, very quiet and dark bedroom (112) was on the ground floor and overlooked the expansive pool. It was very clean, but lacked atmosphere, as did the restaurant. Our tasty group dinner was swiftly served and the wine waiter did a good job. However there didn't seem to be a bar which meant pre- and post dinner drinks meant a lack of conviviality. Next morning my wife and I went for a short stroll around the neighbourhood which comprised nice housing an a stunningly modern church, but it seemed an odd location for such an aspirational hotel property.","44359":"Stayed just one night at the end of our tour. Although very modern, the hotel is not over-large and has nicely furnished rooms and a large pool complex. Staff are friendly and helpful. As a group we had a set meal but it was all good quality and breakfast (continental style) was also good with fresh fruit\/juice, eggs, etc.","44360":"We stayed here for one night as part of an escorted tour. It's located in a rather nondescript suburb and is rather spartan in appearance. The open plan foyer, reception and dining area is reasonably attractive, but there is no bar as such.There is no lift to the upper floor.The rooms are functional and clean but ours only had a Juliet type balcony - no outdoor sitting area. There is a very large pool but because of our tight schedule we couldn't try it. Our group had great difficulty ordering pre-dinner drinks and wine with our meal, because of the slowness of the waiting staff. That said, the wine list had a comprehensive selection of local wines at reasonable prices and the meal itself was fine.","44369":"A modern hotel on the edge of modern Ragusa and a housing estate.\nThe room was comfortable, but not very sound-proof - we could hear the shower in the room next door.\nThe group meal in their restaurant was tasty but a bit on the mean side, and the sommelier was humourless!\nThe swimming pool looked okay, but the loungers were strewn around making it look rather abandone\u2019!","44376":"It is a quiet and serene hotel with unique rooms and beautiful cave wine cellar. The front desk staff were very helpful with directions, what to see, and assisting with an urgent suit pressing. We loved our room and its decor.\n\nThe restaurant was the most enjoyable experience of our stay. The seafood was well matched with the wine and each server explained each course. We never felt rushed and enjoyed watching a wedding party that was occuring outside.","44377":"This hotel was a last minute replacement for another one in the area, for which our tour group was pleased as the other had appeared a little odd in the specs. We only stayed here for one night unfortunately.\n\nThere is no lift but they do help with bags\/cases if you need it. My room was a good size overlooking the pool. I had trouble initially getting the door to open with the new style electronic card and then had trouble getting it to stay shut so I had to put a chair against it to stop it pinging open.\n\nAs with the other hotels none of my adapters fitted their sockets.\n\nThe evening meal was the best we had in the entire week (and I kicked myself afterward that when they came round with seconds I declined). Also, my glass of wine was also the best, despite the real slow service as the wine waiter went round all the group; then there was some sort of delay while we ate our first course and eventually I got served. The staff were very good, friendly and also an improvement on the previous places we had stayed.\n\nThe breakfast was also good although there was no hot eggs, bacon etc and unfortunately the muesli\/graniola had chocolate in it - not good for allergies\/migraine sufferers, but there was plenty of fresh fruit.\n\nThe room was very quiet and the only problem I had sleeping was the duvet on the bed, (easily removed) and the brushed cotton sheets were rather warm.\n\nThe only problems were the shower - 100% in our group agreed that they were death traps as the floors were so slippery; and the fact that I was almost overcharged on checking out. Not sure if it was a muddle over room numbers with the chap in the next room or whether after I was served last with my glass of wine during dinner, his after dinner drink was written down and then added to my bill. However, compared to the problems of the other hotels we stayed in during the week, these were only minor and easily sorted out.","44390":"What a beautiful and stylish hotel! The staff is very friendly and professional, the rooms are clean and cozy, the food is delicious! All in all, it is a fantastic experience, highly recommend :blue_heart:\n\nAfter our check-in, we went for a lunch at the restaurant La Fenice, which amazing. Special thanks for our brilliant sommelier\/waitress for her help in choosing the dishes and wine, big thanks to the chef - the plates he served us were stunning and delicious. :heart_eyes:","44393":"Definitely one of the best hotels I ever stayed in. Very helpful staff at reception, excellent rooms, modern with all facilities! Ample space for luggage, nice view over the garden.\nBreakfast excellent.\nBest of all: Dinner at the Fenice Restaurant - exquisite.\nLooking forward to staying there again","44401":"I booked 3 nights in this hotel, thinking I'll be cosy and chilling by the pool.\n\n2 of the nights are hosting weddings and the pool closes a 6:30pm.\n\nI asked the manager to cancel 2 of the 3 nights.\n\nHe just refuses and kept us in\n\nAvoid this place","44508":"The B&B is well situated just off the main square. The host will assist with getting your car into the parking area as the turning area is limited. Inside, a lovely courtyard leads to the rooms off a common kitchen area. The room we had was spacious but basic and enjoyed a lovely view of the garden. Unfortunately the owners were having a party that evening that went on till the early hours of the next morning. The high heels of the guests went back and forth for many hours and made sleeping difficult. To be fair this would seem to be a one off and the owner did apologise in the morning and told us we were welcome to stay late to rest up. We needed to move on to our next destination however. We had the opportunity to see a wedding taking place in the cathedral at the top of the main square. Great fun to see the spectacle and drama of local activity.","44511":"For those fortunate to book lodging at B & B Le Fioriere you will find this as one of the \"best of the best\". Attention to detail, ambience, cordiallity and beauty are tops. One of the nicest experiences we've had in over nine months of travel, over several years, in Europe. Located in Ragusa Ibla which is a delight. Don't miss B & B Le Fioriere. Jim & Kathy Miller, Colorado\nU.S.A.","44515":"Absolutely stunning place. We stayed there last minute on our trip down the sicilian coast and- even if we had to plan it again, we would definitely stay at the same place!\n\nWe were given a lovely room with a garden view. It was very spacious and comfortable with an access to the communal kitchen. Apart from us there was just one other room in the same building.\n\nThe owner was very friendly. Location was perfect. The hammock in the garden gave it an extra touch! :)\n\nRagusa Ibla itself is a fantastic place. While there, you definitely cannot miss the Gelati di Vini - serving the best ice cream in the world by far!!! We dined at Cucina e Vino- marvelous food and exceptional service.","44516":"We stayed there two nights, and it\u00b4s really good. Big room, very very clean, good bathroom and good breakfast. And it\u00b4ts just in the middle of the old town, ten steps from the square!! It has private parking too, so it\u00b4s perfect if you travel by car. Definitively, if I came back to Ragusa, I would tried to sleep in this B&B again. Javier and Belen.","44616":"Very friendly hosts, clean & big & beautiful room with nice bathroom (fast wifi, van), delicious breakfast, good location (5 min walk to center of ragusa, 25 min easy walk, with nice views, to ragusa ibla) --> perfect place to stay in ragusa. I absolutly recommend it!","44620":"This is great B&B and if i ever come back to Ragusa i already know where to seek for accommodation.Great comfortable rooms, nice clean bathrooms, friendly and kind hosts, smell of fresh baked cookies going around the house, a ride from city center with red Renault 4.Everything was just great. Although we didn't pay for the breakfast we had coffe and cake baked night before while watching Montalbano with Emanuele.\nPleasant stay indeed.","44653":"We chose this hotel because the description said free parking , and parking in the Marina is difficult, and garden view. Well the parking turned out to be just in the street and the garden view was a wall and the passage to the swimming pool and other rooms.\nAlthough the hotel is near the beach there is no access to the beach.\nThe worst part though was the noise, on one side there is an amusement park which makes a racket until midnight and the other side a yoga club which also plays loud music at night.\nThe walls are paper thin and we could hear conversations next door. We had too loud Italian ladies on one side and a crying baby on the other side. Never slept worse than the 5 nights at Aria di Mare.\nThe room was tiny and so was the bathroom. The bed was unusually short and we are average size but our feet were sticking out. The room felt as if it had not been decorated or fully furnished. The airconditioning was inefficient and sometimes appeared to be heating , it also rattled.","44656":"I stayed here for three nights with my partner. We had heard about MDR from a friend- it was a nice base for exploring Ragusa\/Nota with some badly needed pool time and relaxation in the mix! MDR seemed to be full of Italian tourists so it had a different vibe to some of the other places we visited! The hotel was a pleasant surprise! The pool was really lovely and very quiet so much so we practically had it to ourselves most days! The hotel itself had a nice breakfast- seemed typical Sicilian style with lots of cake! It didn\u2019t have a bar or anything and seemed like some areas of the hotel were closed but overall it was ideal for what we wanted! It was close to the hill towns for day trips but equally had a great little pool and we could Potter into the town for dinner in the evenings (about a ten minute walk).","44672":"This is a small hotel which only offers breakfast, buffet style with lots of choice and delicious coffee. You can fill your boots and they don't t mind if you want a bit of fruit for later\n. The room was clean, spacious and well furnished. The staff were very friendly and most spoke English. There is a small outdoor pool and you do not need to cross a road to visit the beach. The promenade to the village is flat and a 10 minute walk. Make a point of visiting the church which is beautiful inside.","44674":"It\u2019s our last day but just to say we v had a really great stay here via Thomas Cook\nCheck in was very swift and without delay\nWe had room 15 by the pool the location of which v conveiniant for making our g n t\u2019s which we drank by the pool (fridge in the room by the way) and the lovely girls on reception supplied our ice!\nThe room was very comfy and spotlessly clean and cleaned daily by the lovely cleaners :pray:\nGreat bathroom and excellent air con which was much needed as the weather was v hot\nPool is beautiful and calm v relaxing area and again spotless and well cared for with a lovely seating area and the beautiful blue flag beach is right along side the hotel! :grin:\nBreakfast was one of the best continentals we v encountered on our travels\nLovely fresh Italian meats breads crossants etc great coffee and juices with some really fresh local pastries and served in the most pretty little breakfast room and I can only say we so enjoyed our breakfasts each and every day\n(No kids here so would say it\u2019s more for adults)\nThe staff here allow you to get on with yr holiday but are there for you when needed\nWe felt they went that extra mile for us too\nWe slept so well here and feel refreshed!\nThe location is in a v quiet spot a good ten minute walk along the sea front to central Ragusa but a really pleasant walk none the less!\nWe would defiantly recommend and we would also like to return in the near future\nWe feel like we v been looked after we really do\nGrattsi to all at the Aria your hotel and staff are a credit to you :blush:","44681":"Just back from a week's stay at this hotel. As others have said it was clean and the staff were all very friendly and helpful. Breakfast was the same each day and we found it to be very acceptable. The coffee machine situation was a bit of a pain and resulted in a wait each morning to get a cup of coffee.\nOur room (9) was pleasant. Clean, with a good shower and useful fridge. There was a shortage of sockets to charge phones etc and we had to unplug the bedside lamps when we needed to charge anything or use straighteners etc. Plenty of wardrobe space and a small desk\/ dressing table. The shower cubicle was big and water flow was very good. Always got a hot shower. Towels seemed to be changed daily. There wasn't much space around the sink to put toiletries but we managed. No balcony or patio to our room and it looked out onto a garden area that needed some TLC. The pool looked lovely when we arrived but I don't think it was cleaned whilst we were there and didn't look so lovely when we left.\nWe experienced very heavy rain on our first full day and the road and pavement outside resembled a lake. The lake actually flooded right into the hotel dining room and through reception into the corridor where rooms were situated. All was cleared up quite quickly and we found a bottle of proseeco and two glasses placed in our room to say sorry for the inconvenience - a lovely touch.The hotel is situated on the edge of the resort, but within easy walking distance to the marina, main square and various restaurants.\nThe beach was lovely, with flat sand and the sunbeds were still out and in use.\nThe lovely receptionists booked a car for us for 3 days that was far cheaper than through Thomas Cook and arrived exactly on time. Beware of the local drivers, they are absolutely mad, definitely the worst drivers we have seen anywhere in the world.\nAll in all we had a pleasant stay at a reasonable price.","44682":"Having read several positive reviews of this \"hotel\" here I was quite disappointed at what I experienced. Admittedly the room, though quite small, was very clean and well serviced. Most of the reception staff were friendly, helpful and spoke good English. The shower was good. However, we seemed to have been in a room (15) that couldn't receive the advertised WiFi. We therefore spent quite a bit of time in the very uncomfortable reception area. There was a fridge in the room which was very welcome as, apart from breakfast, there was nothing available by way of a bar or even a snack-vending machine, so these had to be brought it from the local supermarket. Breakfast was ok - enough on offer but the same each day. As a previous reviewer pointed out, there was just one rather dodgy capsule coffee machine available. So, if there were several guests at breakfast there was a very long wait for a hot drink. Towards the end of the week we were very desperate for a mug of tea or coffee! Sometimes there was a thermos jug with hot water, but on one occasion when a request was made for a refill we were told it was \"finished\"!!! How difficult could it be to boil a kettle? So, this is why I would class this as a not-so-good bed-and-breakfast and not a hotel.\nAs for the location, it was a good 15-minute walk to the main square and this often felt too much to do again in the evening for something to eat. Luckily, the La Felena restaurant just a couple of minutes walk away served amazing pizzas at a reasonable price. I wouldn't choose to stay at the Aria Di Mare again and wouldn't recommend it to friends.","44683":"We visited Marina di Ragusa at the end of the season so everywhere was quiet and the resort gradually winding down, although the hotel was still quite busy. The hotel (or should I say \u2018bed and breakfast\u2019) was less than we expected, nothing terrible but nothing really great. Previous reviews painted a more positive picture to what we experienced. It didn't feel very comfortable and our room was very basic and depressingly dark overlooking the garden at the back but it did have a good air conditioning unit and a fridge. Everywhere was very clean, including the bright and pleasant pool area which hardly anyone seemed to use. We had it all to ourselves on a couple of occasions. The young ladies on reception were always very pleasant and helpful. Breakfasts were generally good apart from the hot drinks option, with a completely useless coffee machine and a total lack of understanding by staff that you need boiling or very hot water to make a cup of tea. It is a good idea to bring your own travel kettle for drinks in your room and buy provisions from the supermarket up the road.The hotel is located on the extremity of the promenade close to the beach and easy walking into town taking around 15 mins. There are quite a lot of restaurants to choose from offering mostly fish or pizza and reception have vouchers for discounts at some restaurants but you have to ask for them. To get around without a car you can use the local bus to get to Punta Secca and Ragusa Ibla, they are not very frequent but run pretty much on time. The tourist information office is in the town square and they offer other trips and can advise on where to go. So all in all a pleasant holiday but it could have been better had we been staying in a more comfortable hotel.","44690":"Awesome place felt very peaceful and tranquil, the pool was outstanding; just big enough and once you are in you certainly warm up. The hotel room was perfect; we stayed in room 21 a double bed with en suite, very clean and tidy and the hotel staff were very friendly, kind and helpful. I cannot rate this hotel enough, its a small hotel with 20+ rooms only, we simply had a devine stay and were warmly welcomed.\nThe hotel even offers beauty treatments, ask reception for further details; not based in the hotel but they will call a lady called \"Selene\" who visits the hotel, offering hand \/ feet treatments, face \/ body treatments, Make-up and Waxing etc \"Sunshine Wellness & Beauty\" pricelist is kept at reception.\nThe surrounding area is beautiful and unspoilt - short walk (around 15 minutes) along the promenade which is right by the side of the beach \/ sea; takes you straight into the Marine square itself, which is stunning and plenty full of friendly locals offering great restaurants, coffee shops, bars and mini market etc.\nWe will definitely go back and stay in the same hotel, they offer Bed & Breakfast only and the breakfast was very good, usual breakfast you would expect abroad; breads, cold meats, boiled eggs, cerel, yoghurt, fresh fruit and cakes, coffee, tea, good selection of herbal teas and juice.\nAlthough there are plenty of places to visit using local transport; the buses are infact slim with a tight timeframe and limited at weekends; its probably best to use local taxies or hire a car and drive yourself.\nThe information centre is on the left hand side as you enter the square in the Marine; there are usually bikes outside and it looks as though you are entering a restaurant \/ bar, here you can book many excursions or hire a bike etc.\nThe restaurant we can highly recommend was called \"a vaneda\" which we ate at most nights; food is stunning with an amazing ambiance.\nOn average depending on where you drink, a glass of beer will set you back around Euro 2.50 and a glass of wine around Euro 4.00 or if you want to go real cheap then visit the supermarket called MD where you can pick up 6 bottles of beer for around Euro 2.19 and a bottle of white wine for around Euro 1.59 - again we visited here several times and popped such drinks in the fridge which is in the room, so an afternoon cheeky went down well - why not when your on holiday!!\nSun beds are around Euro 10.00 each for half a day - we used the blue and white beds based at the \"Baja\" - take care as if you want to use the front row then you will pay more, for example we stayed on beds 14 which was the second row back for half day, if you want a full day then again you will pay more.\nA coffee will set you back around Euro 1.50 again depending on where you drink, if you have a coffee at the front by the beach then you may pay a little more than in the square, we used \"caffe roma\" and \"la sorbetteria\" which gave the best coffee. Water is round Euro 1.00 again depending on where you buy it from.\nI cannot recommend this hotel and place enough - its simply beautiful.","44710":"Stayed here for six nights in September - good value for money and more + than - for us.\nOn the plus side - The staff were really friendly, the rooms were clean & there was a small fridge, the breakfast was good, It was a short walk to a really great beach, a level stroll to the town, easy free parking, good restaurants within a short walk, a good pool, well maintained garden\nOn the down side - no balcony in our smallish room so difficult to dry towels etc, wifi was not very strong, & would have liked an English speaking news channel\n\nI would definitely return","44727":"Unusual hotel with rooms spread around The pretty and pretty hilly town of Ragusa Ibla. We had a second floor bedroom with beautiful views over the deep valley. However, everything seems a little dark and damp and disparate being a non centralised set up. Some on our trip thought the rooms were noisy and dark. Our bathroom was very small and basic and we had been left only one bath towel for the two of us. The owner works hard but prices are on the expensive side.... most expensive limoncello of our trip at 5 euros.","44734":"I loved the concept of this hotel, where a local street's buildings and houses have been adapted to become the rooms and public spaces. The overall architecture is very atmospheric and the owner and his staff were genuinely lovely people - I keenly remember him bringing a large tray of fresh croissants and baked goods for our small tour group's breakfast! However, the quality of your stay will very much depend on the room you are given, as they vary enormously in size and condition. Some were really large; mine was a very small twin. Mine was also very damp indeed - to the extent that I was kept awake by the smell of damp on my bedding, even though it looked and felt perfectly clean and dry. Others in the group had no damp problems at all, but one couple ended up changing rooms twice (because of strange black specks of something over the bedding in the first room and plaster dust falling from the ceiling onto the bed in the second). The other problem was that the reception was closed overnight - it was closed by around 9.30pm and only reopened after our group's breakfast, when we needed to check out! So I'm not sure what would have happened had there been an emergency in the night. So overall - this is a fantastic concept but the owner does need to make sure that the buildings and rooms, as well as being cleanly decorated and with modern bathrooms, also are structurally completely renovated and sound.","44738":"We had a last minute change of plan and decided to head for Ragusa. This was a great find: good value, charming staff and excellent coffee for breakfast. Though all the rooms are dotted around the surrounding streets and there is a little walk to the breakfast room it is rather lovely to be living amongst the locals.\nVery well appoint rooms - simple yet compliments the age of the building with high ceilings, beams, interesting pictures and antique bed heads.\nTheir restaurant Terrazza dell Orologio has fabulous views back up the hill - especially at night it\u2019s a great place for supper or evening drinks. A lift for those who don\u2019t fancy climbing the stairs. Worth looking it up if you fancy coming away from the main square which is just a 5\/6 minute walk away. Surprisingly few restaurants have such views.\nDay trip options include lunch on the beach at Punta Secca - can\u2019t help but be amused by the gentle way detective Montalbano\u2019s fame has created opportunities for the locals. Wouldn\u2019t bother with marina Ragusa.\nA must is the small town of Scicli- 3 euros to see montalbanos office and like the tv programme the streets are stunning yet rather empty. Some lovely new innovative restaurants just next to the dry river running through town. Had the best Pistachio and rose Himalayan salt ice cream at Ummara.\nBack at the hotel - just enjoyed the peacefulness of the place and the warm family and staff who run it. Remember it is a little climb up from the car park but round here you will need to be fit.","44744":"This was a most unusual hotel experience. Lots of climbing to get to our room but it was spacious. The hotel was set into limestone and had a smell, characteristic of lime. Once the a\/c was on, we didn't notice it as much. The room was quite dark, along with the furnishings - but we didn't spend lots of time there. About a 10-15 minute walk into the historic district of town. Breakfast buffet needed more fresh fruit. Coffee was great!","44747":"Unusual setting for a Hotel but very central for Ragusa Ibla...immersed in the old part of this quaint city. It is close to the centre a few minutes within walking distance. The room was always clean and breakfast is continental. The staff are very friendly and very accommodating. There are quite a number of uphills and steps to get to the hotel.","44748":"This hotel is in the ibla so you won't drive to your doorstep. The idea of this hotel was to purchase apartments within a small area of the ibla and restore these into hotel rooms. Each is furnished with antiques and each are unique. The rooms are clean, some are spacious, some are smaller. A few have no windows. But remember, families still live in apartments in the ibla just like your hotel room. If you really want to get a little feel for what it would be like to live in an ibla, this is like nothing else. This hotel is right in the middle of things - a 15 minute walk gets you to the city center and there are all sorts of historic buildings, Baroque architecture and restaurants right near this hotel.\nOur room was #35 on the third floor. It was up three flights of stairs that will give you a workout. At the top, there was one suite room and our one bedroom. The two bedrooms both opened onto a balcony that had a spectacular view of the ibla and countryside. There was also a very modern and large kitchen\/eating area on the same floor that the two rooms shared if you wanted to cook. The room was very quiet at night even with the balcony's French door open.\nThis hotel has a breakfast bar which has a Continental breakfast. There is also a detached wine bar restaurant that might not be your first choice for dinner or getting a glass of wine.\nI wasn't sure I would like this hotel room at first, the Ibla can make one feel a little claustrophobic. But after the first night, I loved it and would like to have stayed much longer than the three night \/ four days I did stay.","44749":"My husband and I stayed for three nights at this wonderfully located hotel right downtown in the historic district. We were with a group of 15 travelers throughout Sicily. We had a gigantic room, consisting of two bedrooms and two bathrooms. We really like the stone walls in the charming decor of this hotel. What is needed is much better lighting (we couldn\u2019t read at night at all due to inadequate lighting), washcloths, the rooftop terrace to have clean chairs and flowers. Breakfast was adequate, not great, basically just Continental. The ricotta-filled croissants were great! Prepare to climb many hills and steps in Ragusa!","44753":"We stayed in Hotel dell'Orologio during a tour of Sicily and found this hotel to be surprising good. Nestled in a quiet side street in \"old\" Ragusa was one of the great things about this hotel. The staff was very customer focus and helpful in very way we could think of. Located near the center of the \"old\" town made this hotel very useful after a long day exploring Ragusa. We had a very unique room and found it made our stay extra special.","44755":"Exceptionally clean, well appointed with a complete kitchen. Beautiful original art inthe rooms. Our room had a outdoor deck that overlooked Ragusa Alta. Our host was helpful and kind throughout our stay which made our visit exceptional.","44756":"Spent only one night. Wish we were there longer. Beautifull hotel. Very clean. Well restored buildings. Friendly personnel. Access by foot via small street and stairs but simply charming. Ragusa is a beautifull little city to discover by foot and hotel is at it\u2019s entrance. Nice terrace with beautifull view. Not to miss !","44758":"Finding this place is a challenge as getting your car into this medieval city is difficult but the staff got our luggage up to our suite and showed us where to park; our rooms provided a panoramic view of this baroque city. The rooms were great, clean, good wifi and a\/c. The bonus was the excellent restaurant attached to the hotel; rooftop dining.","44759":"I had a sudden change of plans and booked a room the day before. I was aware that a room in a separate building was possible but what a please to be guided to a lovely second floor flat with arched windows, vaulted ceiling and a lovely view. On top of this the decorating and art was top notch. Definitely a keeper.","44760":"We had a dinner here, lunch and breakfast and stayed in one of the apartments- great pillows, full kitchen, comfy bed, quiet street free wifi and wonderful staff. Would recommend to anyone staying in Ragusa.","44796":"The hotel was well located in upper Ragusa, with a short walk to Ragusa Ibla. It is near the duomo and main square of Ragusa Superiore, so there are plenty of good restaurants nearby. The staff were helpful. The rooms were of a good standard without being exceptional. The breakfast was a bit ordinary.","44805":"Stayed here three nights and found the hotel to be ideal to visit the sights in Ibla and Superiore. Close to restaurants , bars and shops. The breakfast is very Italian but adequate for us. All the staff were very pleasant and it seemed a \u201chappy\u201d establishment. The receptionist spoke excellent English and was very helpful. Safe and fridge in room with fast WiFi. Would stay here again.","44822":"The hotel is situated in the center of the city. Clean rooms. Refurbished bathrooms. Good breakfast .The receptionists were very friendly and helpfuil. Perfect value for the money you are paying! This was my second visit","44826":"My wife and I stayed 2 nights with a reservation.\nWe drove our rental car 100km from Piazza Armerina, stopping at Caltagirone along the way.\nArriving in Ragusa, Google Maps brought us to the hotel\u2019s front door where I parked in the temporary spot.\nAn English speaking receptionist took our passports and handed us a key. We took the elevator up to our 1st floor #111. The large wooden floored room had a comfortable queen, 2 nightstands, single bed, closet with safe, and refer with small TV above (no English), desk with chair, and a fully outfitted bathroom with glass shower. An insulated door opened to a small balcony over a quiet side street.\nA second receptionist offered a choice to park in the hotel\u2019s secure basement garage(10 Euros\/night) or on the bridge 250 meters south at no cost.\nWe had secure internet, good hot water and heat, and a serviced 7AM breakfast buffet that was heavy on sweets.\nWe walked 200m northwest to the Despar Supermarket, 200 meters west to Cattedrale di San Giovanni, and later 1.5km down the many stairs and up to Ragusa Ibla\u2019s Duomo San Giorgio, passing many other UNESCO sights along the way.\nWe chose this spotless accommodation for its easy auto access and its walking access to this Baroque city, a good value choice for us.","44829":"We just spent one night there with a group from G- Adventures - had a comfortable room; the bathroom was good; had a good breakfast. Staff was helpful and professional. Good hotel for tourists. Good location. Wi-Fi worked ok.","44854":"In all honesty we had been struggling to find any good places to eat whilst in Ragusa that was not in the old town - the food was either poor or cold or you had to wAit 1 hour and a half just for A starter . On our last evening we came across the restaurant Tocco within the Montreal hotel - the staff and food were amazing - every course was explained as to where the Local produce came from and all the food served was \"hot\" which made a nice change - the staff were so attentive and at no time did we have to pour our own wine -\nIf only we had found this restaurant at the beginning of our stay","44930":"The room was huge, clean and it had a small balcony - it was in the first floor (I think it's name was Cabrera), so ask for it. It costed 45 euros, a reasonable price, but there was no breakfast included. Free wi-fi, tv, hair dryer. Andrea-the owner-was friendly.","44965":"La Dimora is a small hotel in a quiet little piazza.\n\nHere are our pro's and con's:\n\n+Clean & large rooms - spotless.\n+Friendly staff - even if everybody did not understand English, we were able to communicate.\n+Free parking - thats a good one in Ragusa. Leave the car and walk.\n+Fridge\n+Quiet location (except for the churchbells, but that's part of the charm, isnt it?)\n+Very affordable\n\n-We got a room on the first floor with large glass doors. Didnt feel completely safe and private when people walked by. I guess the rooms up higher are better. We did not ask for another room either, we were only gonna stay one night.\n-The breakfast, im sorry, but I wouldnt call it breakfast. But it seems like breakfast isnt more than this in Italy.,\n-AC did not work properly - ok, we did not complain either, so we cant actually complain so much here either.\n-The room had a funky smell from time to time, probably because of the not completely working AC.\n-The distance to Ragusa Ibla. We managed, but if you are older or cant walk very well and want to visit Ragusa Ibla, this might be to far for you\n\nOverall, I would recommend this hotel thanks to the price, the staff and the clean rooms. It's not the best I have stayed in, but very far from the worst.","44968":"We found that host was friendly and polite. The hotel isn\u2019t in a bad position, but in retrospect, I would have stayed in the old part of town.\nOn the plus side, the room was spacious and the bed comfortable. The linen was clean and the towels were generous. However, there are quite a few maintenance issues that need to be addressed to get this place up to standard. There wasn\u2019t a toilet roll holder in our bathroom. The roll had to be placed on the bidet. Also, some of the blinds were broken the windows didn\u2019t seal well, so cold air leaked into the room.\nThe toiletries were great - body lotion, shampoo, body wash. One maintenance issue in our friend\u2019s room was that the rug really needed a good clean as did the sofas in all three rooms.\nThe breakfast was very good with warm rolls and warm boiled eggs amongst some of the choices. The cappuccino was nice and hot too.\nThe only problem was that the breakfast area smelt terribly of cigarette smoke when we entered, but cleared when the doors were opened. Though it did make the room very cool. It is a long way to walk to the old part of town and the stairs looked quite intimidating. Going down would be fine, coming up would be another matter.","44993":"Although we enjoyed our breakfast but it had Limited food options\nThe restaurant area smelled omlet !\n*Good service\n*I wouldnt visit again soon\n*The location is very good\n*good seating and food options for the children","45046":"I echo all the complimentary things people have said about this place. The attention to detail and the high standard of service are commendable. The accommodation was spacious and spotlessly clean. Having 2 balconies surrounded by jasmine was a real treat. The welcoming parcel of cake and coffee was most appreciated. 24 hrs reception in such a small property was a plus.\nAs suggested we did have the breakfast at an additional charge and it was a real treat\nThe pool area and the gardens were immaculate and so well looked after. It was good to be able to park our car safely within the property.\nI give it 5 stars as it was so relaxing and a little oasis away from the hubbub of the resort. Although it is a 15 min walk from La scibina to the heart of the resort there are some restaurants and supermarkets close by.\nThank you","45052":"The hotel is incredible, the bedrooms are modern, clean and very comfortable.\nEverything is absolutely charming and has an special touch of the owners who are simply amazing, friendly and helpful.\nI absolutely recommend the place, because of the location and the outstanding quality of service.\nThank you very much for the lovely time.","45053":"La Scibina is situated nicely out of the main town, in an area that looks set for more high-end development. The conversion of an old Almond warehouse has been done to a very high standard, offering contemporary fixtures and fittings, whilst maintaining the high ceilings and beams of the original building.\nThe access-controlled environment is very secure, yet made very welcoming by Elenia, who was always there to help and advise during our stay.\nLa Scibina boasts something I have not found previously, a well stocked herb garden, which you are encouraged to make use of in your cooking (oregano, rosemary, and other usual herbs, but also lemons, limes, oranges and we were also presented with some herbs and freshly picked green-tea as we departed).\nThere is a small children's pool, and an excellent main pool, with flotation toys etc. available, plus plenty of sun-beds complimented by shaded chairs & tables for reading and relaxing.\nThe pool-bar is open until 1930hrs, offering food and drinks of all sorts, run by one of the highlights of the residence, Valentina, who offers free home-made cakes to balance the calories lost in the pool.","45054":"Anna, Raffaella, Valentina and the rest of the team were most welcoming, and nothing was too much trouble. The breakfast each morning consisted of freshly prepared local dishes, bread, pastries and cakes. Local cheeses and honey were also available.\nA range of drinks and snacks are available poolside during the day, and often Valentina will offer fruit, a little pot of tiramisu or the like to you whilst you relax. There is nothing better than an aperitivo poolside!\nRooms are spacious with effective air conditioning. Beautiful gardens. Short walk to the sea front, nice sandy beach. Lots of restaurants within walking distance in the resort. All in all a wonderfully relaxing stay !","45064":"Set in a residential area 20 mins walk from the centre, this is a very peaceful retreat from the hussle and bustle of the town. The staff and owner were absolutely delightful and on a mission to help and assist guests to relax and enjoy themselves (trip and restaurant recommendations etc). Breakfast in the courtyard was equally delightful. The pool is large in comparison to the overall accommodation and hence not overcrowded. For the avoidance is doubt this is very much a relaxed B&B type environment with a really nice pool area. Bars and nightlife can be found in and on the road to the town.","45076":"A lovely time at la Scibina. The staff was wonderful and so helpful. The apartments were beautifully decorated and very comfortable with a wonderful sea view. The perfect place for a relaxing holiday. Unforgettable days!","45118":"Congratulations to the staff of La Scibina, we can just confirm al the positive revieuws, studio with fantastic terras overlooking nice garden, pool and sea,\noutstanding breakfast, super location to discover the south of Sicily, everybody was so helpful and friendly, we stayed in La Scibina for 5 nights and would certainly come back ENJOY RELAX TOP CLASS","45135":"A delightful stay here, arriving by car, parking for free very nearby in a church yard. Limited street parking was also available, though the streets are not all easy to negotiate. The room was spacious in an Italian rustic style, with a lovely tiny study annexe leading to the bathroom, dark tiled floor and gorgeous little balcony. It was all quiet and relaxing. Concetta was the most welcoming and helpful hostess we could have wished for, and gave us travel ideas for our next destinations in her very good English. Breakfast, at her home just around the corner, was delicious and plentiful. Locanda la Meridiana was in an ideal location for exploring Ragusa Ibla - the lovely old town down the hill.","45139":"This lovely B&B in one of Sicily's most attractive small cities provides a welcome to travellers and all the service of the best of B&Bs for a most reasonable cost - it is a small gem and that is entirely due to the generosity,grace and competence of its owner\nSignora Concetta. We stayed for two nights in early October and wished we had stayed longer.\n\nWe arrived hours late due to bad weather and a cancelled train. Concetta kept in touch by phone and arranged for us to be met and then provided us with restorative tea or coffee and homemade pastries. She offered and we accepted with gratitude advice on a dinner booking which she made for us.\n\nAs others have said the rooms in this B&B are in several adjoining houses in a street of well restored 18th century houses. We had a room on the ground floor with its own access from the street. We had a private bathroom with large shower suitable for use by a disabled person and there was a small kitchen for guests use including with a supply of bottled water. The bed was most comfortable, there was ample space for our belongings and it was quiet.\n\nBreakfast is served in Concetta's beautiful home immediately round the corner from the guest accommodation. On the first day we breakfasted on a table covered in linen and lace and pieces of family silver. There was fruit - figs , pomegranate juice,home made pastries ,bread a magnificent collection of homemade jams, savoury pastries\u2026. On the second day we had breakfast at leisure the in old and lovely garden.\n\nThe B&B is in Ragusa Superiore which while very attractive is not perhaps as scenic as Ibla but it had for us the great advantage of being more accessible to the bus and train stations which we were using. The centre of Ragusa with shops and restaurants is a few minutes walk in one direction and superb views of the whole wonderful Baroque city that makes up Ragusa Superiore and Ibla are at the end of the short street in the other.\n\nLa Meridiana is unique and wonderful. We loved it and wish only to return.\n\nI think the B&B is wheelchair accessible but I am unsure. Wise to check if this is vital.","45205":"This B&B is a highly renovated traditional house. The decor is simple - modern, yet faithful to the character of the place. The rooms are lovely: crisp, clean, and very spacious (our room felt more like a suite, and the bathroom was very comfortable - also equipped with bidet and blow-dryer). We also could enjoy a breath-taking view from our window.\nThe breakfast is continental with a Sicilian touch, and it is all very relaxed.\nThe host is very courteous and makes you feel very much at home. Although the B&B is more like a house than a hotel, the host does not actually live there; he is usually on site at breakfast time, but is very approachable and responds to any needs by message at other times of the day.\nThis lovely B&B is located in one of the small streets just outside Ragusa Ibla (the historic centre) - so not exactly central. However, it is within a few minutes' walk (often uphill, but not too steep).\nThere is lots more I could say about this B&B - and all good. Definitely worth a first-hand visit!","45207":"Great hospitality extremely clean nice breakfast and accomodation\nOne could not ask for more.There is also a lovely view of Ragusa ibla.\nIt is very quiet and relaxing and really worth a visit.\nThe place to stay in Ragusa","45214":"We visited for just the one night with our 3 year old. The location is amazing, you are very close to the sights and easy walking distance to the main square. Everything in Ragusa Ibla is up and down steps and hills so you just have to live with it! The view from the room is exceptional as was our host Giuseppe. He immediately showed us a map of the town upon arrival and gave us tips on the best walking routes. He prepared a wonderful breakfast with fresh pastries from the bakery, and I've never tasted grapes like that! I must say I absolutely loved this place, Ragusa Ibla and La Casa Di Matilde! It's a shame we only stayed 1 night, but then you can see the whole town in a day. If\/when we return, we will be back Giuseppe, thank you!","45240":"With a few steps up to get to this accommodation, it maybe isn't the best place for people with mobility issues, however neither is Ragussa as its built between 2hills. Case de Matilde is a small, very welcoming place, with beautifully clean rooms, fantastic food, fantastic views and not forgetting the wonderful owner Guiseppe. Nothing is a problem for him. Each room is elegant in its minimalistic design, however each room has all the essentials you require of a B and B. I look forward to visiting again soon.","45265":"Excellent choice; Family Run Hotel with a strong emphasis on cleanliness. Very comfortable rooms full of traditional features and having lavish bathrooms. Perfect and strongly recommended for anyone visiting Ragusa","45268":"It was incredibly quiet in December in Ragusa. We had hotel Sabbinirica nearly to ourselves! One would think that the breakfast and staffing might be scaled back when it is so empty. But the exact opposite was true. The breakfast wasn't only plentiful, but the attention to my husband's gluten and dairy intolerances was more than accommodated to! A different gluten-free torte was provided to him each morning, along with breads, cereals, biscuits, alternative milks ... Everything was immaculate. Our hosts helped to book us different experiences and helped us to find a repair for a flat tire. Our room was warm and cozy, which for a hotel built into a cave - we were worried it might be chilly. They even made our belongings look perfect and quaint in the beautiful room. The bed and linens were so comfortable. The position of the hotel was perfectly in the center of the old town, with beautiful views. We will definitely be back to Ragusa and we wouldn't dream of staying anywhere else!","45269":"Our room was on the first floor and it was carved out of the mountain rock. The view from the balcony was exceptional especially at sunset. Our first attempt to drive up to the hotel was an adventure as we had navigate the very narrow streets only to find that the car park was situated at the other end of the town. We called Laura who gave us instructions where to park and she then arrived to collect us and our luggage in the hotel's white tuk tuk van. Breakfast was excellent and Tiziana (Laura's sister) was very helpful with suggestions on where to eat and places to visit. Ragusa is beautiful baroque town which is featured in the TV show Inspector Montalbano. rin the new","45271":"Good location in old town. About 10 minute steep climb with luggage from parking. Free parking lot is often full. There is reasonably priced bigger parking lot across the street with plenty of spaces available. Downloaded and used Easy Park app to pay for the parking there. Excellent breakfast, very welcoming hosts. Clean and comfortable rooms.","45272":"This is a good spot to be because it's not far from the car park (although uphill) and still an easy walk into the Piazza Duomo. You are not in the midst of all the tourists, it's quiet and we loved the spectacular view from our door across to the old buildings all jumbled together. There was a little table and chairs just outside our door. The room was large and comfortable with the air conditioner on, but it did smell a little of damp rock sometimes. The breakfast room\/bar was very nice and our welcome from Laura was very friendly, her English is excellent and she will tell you by email or on the phone which way to walk with the suitcases. When you find come to park in Piazza Repubblica, try to get into the first section on your right, or first bays on left, these are the only free parts and not many cars fit! Check for blue lines which mean you must pay by the hour in coins. The inspector is often there giving fines!","45273":"A great place for a short stay in Ragusa. The building is brilliant renovated, with the rooms carved out of massive stone walls\u2014which makes them incredibly quiet, as well as charmingly rustic. We thought we were all alone in the hotel, it was so quiet, until we went down to breakfast the next morning and found it fully booked! The bed was comfortable, the AC great, and the location can\u2019t be beat: you\u2019re just steps from the Duomo. Laura was terrific\u2014she got us oriented quickly when we arrived, and she was really generous about driving down to the public parking lot to pick us up. The parking lot itself wasn\u2019t easy to find\u2014it\u2019s tricky finding the turnoff to Ragusa Ibla. But once you locate the turn off the SS115, just look for the first public parking lot at the bottom of the hill. When you get there, Laura is terrific about getting you up to the hotel. Ragusa itself didn\u2019t occupy us for more than half a day, but it\u2019s a great base for seeing other baroque towns in the area (Noto, Modica), and the Villa Romana (which is not to be missed!) is only about an hour and a half away.","45278":"My husband and I and our two daughters enjoyed one evening at this lovely hotel. We arrived on the late side but were greeted warmly. The sun was setting soon after and the walk into the town really was magical.This hotel is perfectly placed and has everything needed for a comfortable stay in Ragusa. I wish we could have stayed longer and plan to return.","45285":"Sabbinirica is a wonderful hotel with one overwhelming safety problem that should not be overlooked by any responsible traveler.\n\nThe good things about the hotel are really good: it's beautiful, well-located, has a great breakfast, and the staff are really nice and helpful people. It's also great value.\n\nUnfortunately, the hotel has one huge problem. At night, the front door is blocked by a metal gate that cannot be opened. The only other exit is a rear door that can only be opened with a key. This means that if there were a fire or other disaster at night, and you could not locate or forgot your key, you could not escape through any of the doors, and there is the very real risk you might die. On top of this, there are no staff on the property at night (not that you would want to rely on staff in a disaster situation anyway).\n\nIf Sabbinirica were to simply change their locks, I would definitely change my review to five stars. Everything else about it is very good for the price. Unfortunately, the locks are a big life-safety issue and should not be overlooked by any responsible traveler.","45287":"This wonderful hotel is located in the city center of Ragusa Ibla close to everything. Our 1 night stay could not have been any better thanks to all the hard work Laura & Tiziana put into their place to make their clients comfortable & happy. Free parking is only a short walk from the hotel and many thanks to Tiziana in helping us with our luggage when we first arrived. The pictures of this place do not do it justice of how beautiful this hotel is. We enjoyed the breakfast with a good selection of both sweet & savory items. Thank you Sabbinirica for making our short stay in this picturesque town so memorable.","45288":"I cannot say enough good things about this lovely, charming hotel! The hotel itself is built into the side of the mountain in Ragusa, which lends a very dramatic style element, raw stone, etc...it looks very much like the pages of a design book. The rooms are beautiful, perfectly clean, and very well-appointed. We stayed in a second floor room with an amazing view of the city below. The hotel is located in Ragusa Ibla, which is the amazing, historical center of the city. Perfectly situated for exploring the nearby square and charming, cobblestone streets. Breakfast was great, very fresh food and changed daily. Beyond all this, the ladies who run the Inn were so accommodating and helpful from the moment we booked our room. They helped us with parking, made restaurant recommendations, and very kindly drove us to and from our car upon check-in and check-out. It's a very close walk to the parking (5 mins) but with our massive suitcases and the cobblestones, it was much appreciated. I will 100% stay here again, if I'm lucky enough to return to Ragusa. They could really charge much more--the price was so reasonable for this level of beauty and service.","45290":"We found this place last minute as our reserved hotel failed us. Laura and her sister were so kind and even picked us up at the parking lot because we couldn\u2019t drive in. The room was extremely clean as well as beautiful and had everything we needed. The breakfast was one of the best spreads of our trip and in an amazingly cool room. Hotel Sabbrinica made our trip to Ragusa for sure! I would go back in a heartbeat.","45295":"We had a wonderful stay at Sabbinirica in October 2018. Yes, there are a lot of stairs to get to the hotel, but staying in Ragusa Ibla is a terrific experience. We had a beautiful room with a huge bathroom and a view over the gorge. The bed and pillows were comfortable. Laura and Tisiana are very helpful, prompt in their email responses and provide good recommendations. Breakfast is a wide variety of sweet and savoury choices. Once you become oriented, it is easy to get around Ragusa Ibla, although none of the streets are straight, unlike the \u201cnew\u201d Ragusa. You park in the Public Parking lot (for free) and they will bring up your luggage. To walk up to the hotel, go to the very end of the bus parking lot, and walk up the stairs on the left. This takes you to the tourist information office. Take the little street to the left of the office and ascend the first staircase to the left you come across. Once at the top walk a bit further and you will be at the front reception.\nWhen we were booking our accommodation for our 5 night stay in Ragusa Ibla, we did consider other B&B\u2019s, but Sabbinirica was highly recommended to us. Although it was a bit more expensive, we were very glad we chose to stay there, for the comfort of the room and the hospitality.","45296":"We loved our stay here. Only one night but so lovely. Laura and her sister in law have created such a lovely B & B. Thank you both! So beautifully decorated. Comfy room and a lovely breakfast. Picked us up at the parking below and dropped us off again upon our departure. Highly recommended!","45297":"Staying at Sabbinirica B and B was our finest stay in Sicily. Let me start first with Laura, the owner, who is outstanding in every way-she replies to emails promptly, is generous with her suggestions, answered my MANY queries and upon finally meeting her -the most hospitable! The B & B is unlike any place you\u2019ve stayed in, perfectly decorated with painted ceilings, lots of storage, excellent showers with hot water, extremely comfortable mattress and linens and pillows, hooks on the walls (not common), and it\u2019s quiet for sleeping. It\u2019s built into a cave but feels bright and airy! I felt like a princess in her castle, it\u2019s that beautiful! And the breakfast....everything you can think of and you\u2019re eating in a renovated cave. Laura has exactly what it takes to run a successful B and B. Her customer care is exemplary. She even bought cannolis and placed them in our friends room with a bottle of wine for his birthday. She ran out and bought them fresh for our arrival. Bravo Laura-your efforts to detail has given us (6 of us), a dreamy stay at your establishment. We wish we could have stayed much longer in our luxury dream world.","45299":"This B and B was in an excellent location and featured very clean comfortable rooms with charming detail that is characteristic of Ragusa. The breakfasts are absolutely top notch and plentiful and held in a bright attractive room. The two women who own the Sabbinirica were incredibly helpful, kin, and professional. They helped us with parking information as well as assisting in dining and touring. All in all an excellent home base in Ragusa!","45300":"Great locations, beautiful rooms, picture postcard view and the friendliest staff you could ask for. Loved their home made breakfasts with all the yummy cakes one could ask for and great capouccinos.\nStayed three nights and could have stayed many more!","45301":"A beautiful property and a highlight of our stay in Sicily. After some hectic travel this was an oasis of calm and serenity. With a car follow Google maps to the designated overnight parking area and leave the car behind. It wasn't difficult. If the parking lot is full just wait 10 or 15 minutes and chances are some cars will leave. Ragusa is beautiful in the evening with many fine dining choices. The breakfast was well above average and the owner\/staff were a delight. We could have stayed longer and used this as a base for some day trips.","45305":"What a wonderful place to stay! Laura and her team made us feel at home.\nThe location was very close to the old town where we spent our days and nights.\nOur room did not have a view but if you open the door to outside there was a beautiful view that lit up at night. Beside the door outside were 2 chairs and a table to relax and enjoy a glass of wine or coffee. Included was a huge buffet breakfast Italian style but also many other options too! A wonderful choice of foods!\n\nThe bed was comfortable as was the whole room and quite spacious too!\n\nThis place is so charming and very unique in a good way.\nThe owners are friendly and welcoming!\nThank you Laura and everyone for making our stay so comfortable!","45306":"The view from our room (#5) was fantastic both day and night. Laura and Clarice and the rest of the staff were very warm, friendly, and helpful. Our room and the hotel were spotless. The hotel is so charming and welcoming. We couldn't have stayed anywhere better. We would go back in a second. Thanks again for making our stay so outstanding.","45307":"Like a tardis, the room door swung open into a large bedroom space with an extensive bathroom off to the side. You wouldn't expect it from the exterior. The whole old town is hidden behind bolted gates and secret doorways.\nThe renovation has been beautifully done with old tiles, chandeliers, lamps in old Italian style to fit current style and modern living requirements. I never expected a double shower!\n\nOur room overlooked the new town and the flowing river below. This is quite noisy, but it drowns out all other noise from outside so for me it became more soothing.\n\nI loved the lovely breakfast room and the small touches. Like collecting us from the car park and providing umbrellas in the rain.\nIn the old town the main piazza is a two minute walk away with cafes, restaurants and sights.\nWe would definitely recommend this hidden gem.","45309":"We found ourselves in Ragusa Ibla on a Friday night with no hotel reservation. We'd screwed up the dates of our online reservation at a well-known hotel near the Duomo and were desperate to find someone to stay. The last room in town was at this little hotel. Not expecting much, we arrived to find the most charming, friendly hotel we'd ever been to. Much more appealing than the larger, better-known place we'd been shut out of. The staff greeted us warmly and were happy to accommodate our needs by bringing in an extra bed (there were four of us), and serving us espresso in their adorable cafe while we waited for the extra bed to be made up. The room itself (number 6) was roomy, quiet, comfortable, and quaint, with lots of tasteful, Sicilian-style details. The bathroom was large and the room had a little balcony with a view of Ragusa on the opposite hillside. I cannot say enough about the friendliness of the small staff, who treated us like old friends. The little cafe on the first floor is beautiful and offers a complimentary breakfast that had everything we could want, including local chocolate from nearby Modica. The location is also very good, within easy walking distance of everything in Ragusa Ibla. We were sorry to have to leave the next day!","45311":"If you are thinking about going to Ragusa, which is a great idea, stay at the Sabbinirica if you like a charming hotel experience. This hotel and its owners make for a truly memorable experience. Attention to detail is what makes this place better than the usual good experience. They will pick you up in the free parking lot down below the hotel and drop you off after your stay ends. The room we stayed in,#1 is gorgeous stone with a bathroom shower that is unusually large for Italy. The towels smell nice, the soap is better the lighting is better everything you see, touch or eat and drink at the Sabbinirica is tops. I have traveled all over the world at many five star places which did not make me as happy as well cared for as the Sabbinirica. If you are trying to find a great place and are searching and reading reviews as we did end your research now and book this place you won't be making a mistake.","45314":"The hotel is nice enough for its price point. Very clean and relatively central. Though the approach is up and down lots of steps so the car cannot come near it. The breakfast is nicely done, though heavier on the sweets compared with healthy alternatives. The reason for the lower rating is that a few basic things weren't in place: no comfortable sitting areas; wifi didn't work in the room throughout the stay; amenities were basic such as difficult to accesss or no power points to charge the phone at near the bed; the bathroom sink was in the same area as the bedroom and that made things a bit messy -- a separation would be better' a dank smell from the otherwise nice cave-walls of the bathroom. Overall, okay for a night.","45315":"My family and I have just sadly just finished our stay at Sabbinrica in Ragusa.\nThis is a stunning small B&B where the level of service and attention to detail\nwas amazing. Its a bit hard to find along with many hotels in the old town but the\nstaff did a great getting us there and organised a driver to take us on to our next\ndestination. The breakfast was a work of art and you almost felt bad eating to food.\nThe rooms are built into the hill side which combined with clever design creates a very\ncharismatic effect.. Then you look out the window and see Ragusa old town and its just one big \"wow\". Love Sabbinrica.","45316":"Charming, beautiful hotel with wonderful breakfasts, clean, comfortable rooms and exquisite d\u00e9cor.\nGetting in and out of Ragusa is a bit of a challenge but the owners of this hotel do everything possible to make your stay comfortable.\nYou can't go wrong here. A wonderful choice and thank you for a great stay!","45319":"We loved our stay at Sabbinrica! Laura and Francesco were warm and welcoming hosts. The hotel is beautifully decorated with many personal touches. We stayed in a magical room with arched, stone walls. Breakfast was divine - homemade jams, sweets and more. And, we loved arriving to the hotel in their signature Ape vehicle. We wished we had spent more than one night!","45320":"From arrival to departure we had wonderful service from Laura, Titsiana (sorry about the spelling) and their team of helpers. As parking is difficult in Ragusa, they picked us up from the coach and took us to our accomodation, which was an apartment adjacent to the B&B. The whole building was fascinating and full of character, so different to a standard hotel. It was built into the rock structure and on various levels. Everything was beautifully clean and well appointed. We were kindly offered coffee and cake before we went to unpack! We were also given an excellent map of Ragusa. As we would need to find somewhere to eat in the evening we asked for any recommendations and these were helpfully marked onto our map for us.\n\nOur apartment had a kitchen, with hob, microwave, fridge etc and was even supplied with basic cooking ingredients (including herbs) plus coffee and tea (various kinds). There was a small lounge and large bedroom with modern en suite plus a balcony.\nBreakfasts were a treat! Each day the selection provided varied slightly but always included fruits, cheeses, meats, olives, unusual jams and chutneys, cakes, biscuits, bread, yoghourts, tomatoes with herbs and modica chocolate (a new and enjoyable experience). Everyday we received a warm welcome from our hosts.\n\nRagusa is well worth a visit of at least a week. There are so many interesting places to visit and sights to see.However, there are lots of steps and slopes but we did see a gentleman with 2 sticks who managed to get around ok.\n\nAt the end of our stay Laura took us down to the coach park along with our luggage. Needless to say, we were sad to leave the Sabbinirica and Ragusa and would love to revisit them some time.","45322":"We spent two nights at this beautiful, well located small hotel\/B&B. The owners have lovingly restored the building and incorporated the centuries-old architecture into the rooms while making the current decor modern and chic. Every detail that a guest could need or want is taken into consideration. Our double room with balcony (one floor up from the reception) was spacious, and we had a gorgeous view of the village from our large window. The buffet breakfasts were absolutely amazing, with a variety of delicious savory and sweet options. The owners\/hosts were lovely and helpful, and even came and rescued us after we had trouble finding the free public parking lot when we first arrived in town. (Note: Get good directions in advance.)","45323":"Sabbinirica was everything that other reviewers have written - a charming property, well located for seeing Ragusa Ibla, with spacious and well-appointed rooms and wonderfully friendly and helpful hosts.\n\nRooms: I was traveling with 2 friends. We had the two rooms (\"Classic\" doubles) at the top of the stairs behind reception. They are the only 2 rooms up that staircase, so it felt like we had the place to ourselves.\n\nMy room was on the left at the top of the stairs and was large. with French doors that open to a small balcony with a view across the valley and fresh air at night without any street noise.\n\nI loved the obvious attention in the rooms for the convenience of travelers: several chairs, a wardrobe for clothes, a bench for luggage with shelves underneath for shoes, another hanging clothes bar and shelf, and hooks to hang your coat or scarf.\n\nElectronics: I especially appreciated that one of the bedside lamps had an extra outlet for charging your phones. The wifi worked perfectly.\n\nShower: large, walk-in style with a high, overhead shower. Even tall people should be pleased. Bonus - a warming rack for towels.\n\nBreakfasts: the breakfast room is a lovely place to start the day, with an ample array of fruits, yogurts, meats, cheeses, homemade pastries and choice of coffees.\n\nThe architecture of the property is so lovely that you'll want to stay in to enjoy your room! The location is perfect - in a quiet section of town, a short walk so you can get out and see Ragusa Ibla.","45324":"We highly recommend this place!! Would return in a heartbeat! Probably my favorite place we stayed in Sicily. Laura and family were attentive hosts. Very personable. Always available to offer tips for places to eat and visit. The breakfast was top notch. The property has been renovated with attention to detail. Our room was roomy and the bed was very comfortable! (Not always the case in Sicily). Everything and everyone meet our expectations!! Thank you so much Sabbinirica!!!! Hope to see you again!","45328":"We chose to stay 4 nights at Sabbinirica during our 2 weeks in Sicily. This was the best decision we made during our vacation. Our host Laura and her family know how to run a bed and breakfast. This is the best B & B that we have ever encountered in our many trips to Europe. The hotel is magical. Our room was immaculate and had every amenity one could ask for. The breakfast was a bit different each morning and we have been talking about it since we left. If you get a chance to visit this wonderful area of Sicily, do not pass this beautiful gem of a hotel up. Words cannot adequately describe this fabulous accommodation and Ragusa should not be missed. Thank you Laura! You are the best!!!","45330":"One of the cosiest places we stayed in Sicily. Ragusa is charming, and Sabbinirica is just in the middle of the old town. Lovely, clean rooms and bathrooms. The owners are five stars, especially Laura.They went to pick up us with their small cars, and for that, they even waited a bit beyond our check-in hour, which we appreciated very much. The most delicious homemade breakfast was presented to us next morning. Don't miss the lemon marmalade. We would be back for sure!","45331":"I will start with saying thank you to Laura and her husband for the nice time we had at their hotel. It is a small boutique hotel that they recently opened and have refurbished from tip to toe; The attention to details is high and the service is irreproachable. Our room was very large with an ample en-suite bathroom. We had the view on the river and valley. The location is great too as it is less than 5 min walk from the very centre of Ragusa Iblea. Special touch from Laura who went to great length to find Gluten Free products for my daughter; actually SORRY, to BAKE some nice gluten free cake for my daughter will I indulged in nice (surely homemade) local salami \/ cheeses \/ desserts The breakfast was full of nice local delicacies. Well done to you. Truly amazing place.","45333":"This is really a great place to stay for a few nights in Ragusa. The owners are very friendly and helpful, the rooms very nice, breakfast just amazing! In the middle of old town, everything is very close by walking. ask the owners for the best restaurants in town, they will give you good advice!!","45343":"It is a very nice hotel. The hotel is very new, so everything looks fresh. The owners were very friendly and had good tips for restaurants in the neighbourhood. Clean rooms and nice breakfast with great choice of italian sweetness. Location is perfect for a visit to the old town of Ragusa. They came to pick us up in a tuktuk, great for the children. The price vs quality is good. We can recommand this hotel to everyone."},"Hometown":{"0":"Regno Unito","5":"Regno Unito","8":"Germania","10":"Stati Uniti","11":"Stati Uniti","14":"Stati Uniti","19":"Stati Uniti","20":"Stati
